# Systematic conceptual model development

This repository contains scripts and data files needed to replicate methods associated with: Grames, E.M., D. Schwartz, and C.S. Elphick (in review). A systematic method for conceptual model development.

Conceptual models are necessary to synthesize what is known about a topic and predict future states of systems, but the process of developing conceptual models has high potential to be biased or incomplete. We present a novel, systematic approach to conceptual model development through qualitative synthesis and graphical analysis of hypotheses, using habitat edge and patch area sensitivity of forest songbirds to illustrate the approach. We conducted a systematic review to identify population and community studies on breeding forest songbirds that exhibit edge or area sensitivity, extracted hypothesized causal pathways, assembled all causal pathways into a single network model linking hypotheses across studies, and explored trends in research on edge and area sensitivity with respect to space and time. This approach can be used to synthesize scientific thinking across any field of research, guide future research to fill in knowledge gaps efficiently, and help researchers systematically build conceptual models.

In scripts/ the network_building.R script can be used with the example data or adapted by researchers using this approach to build models of linked hypotheses. 

In edge-area-sensitivity/ there are complete files to generate an interactive Shiny app using the example data, which users can adapt for other questions.
