TI  - PAST DISTRIBUTION OF TILIA-FEEDING PHYLLONORYCTER MICROMOTH (LEPIDOPTERA GRACILLARIIDAE) IN THE RUSSIAN FAR EAST BASED ON SURVEY OF HISTORICAL HERBARIUM
AB  - Distribution data of Tilia-feeding Phyllonorycter in the Russian Far East have been retrieved from a century-old Tilia herbarium stored in Vladivostok. Overall, 280 typical mines of Phyllonorycter, some with larvae and pupae, were found on 61 out of 799 herbarized specimens of Tilia spp. collected in Khabarovskii krai and Primorskii krai. For the first time, the presence of Tilia-feeding Phyllonorycter has been documented in Amurskaya oblast and Jewish Autonomous oblast. High densities of the leafminer have been recorded on Tilia amurensis sampled in Khabarovskii krai and Primorskii krai between 1937 and 2005 suggesting a population dynamics with recurrent outbreaks. Our results confirm the importance of historical herbarium collections in studying trophic interactions and invasion ecology of folivore organisms.

TI  - A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation
AB  - Butterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.

TI  - Arctiini Leach, [1815] (Lepidoptera, Erebidae, Arctiinae) of the Brazilian Amazon. IV - Subtribe Euchromiina Butler, 1876
AB  - The Euchromiina moths comprise 735 species in the neotropics. Here we provide a list of Euchromiina species from the Brazilian Amazon. The list was produced from specimens deposited in the most important Brazilian collections and from literature data. Nearly 30% (219) of the neotropics Euchromiina species were recorded, including 13 new occurrences for the Brazilian Amazon. Santarm and Belm were the municipalities with the highest number of species records, with 96 and 74, respectively. Although the number of Euchromiina records is high in the Amazon, this value is underestimated because the fauna was never sampled in the vast majority of the biome. This is a worrying scenario because the Amazon has the world highest absolute rate of forest reduction. In order to suggest efficient conservation policies for the Amazon Arctiinae fauna, it is urgent to intensify the sampling effort in this biome.

TI  - Monitoring environmental effects on farmland Lepidoptera Does necessary sampling effort vary between different bio-geographic regions in Europe?
AB  - Highlights The butterfly diversity is high in farmland of Romania and Spain, and less in Sweden. The coefficient of variance of transect-specific species richness declined beyond 800 m transect length. The required sample size to record a 10% loss of species was less than 30 transects per region. The time to be invested in field work differed between countries. The final effort to document a change of a certain magnitude was similar between countries. Abstract In agro-ecosystems, environmental monitoring is fundamental to detect and survey changes related to land use change and management practices. Butterflies and moths have often been suggested as suitable indicators for monitoring environmental effects on biodiversity in farmlands. Here, we estimated the required sample size and monitoring effort necessary to run a Lepidoptera survey in European farmland, assessing in particular if monitoring investment would differ between representative bio-geographical regions. We operated linear 1-km long transect routes in farmland of Romania, Spain and Sweden from 2013 to 2015, and recorded butterflies and burnet moths (Papilionoidea, Zygaenidae). The transects were walked back and forth four times a season, and replicated yearly. The lepidopteran diversity was high in farmlands of Romania and Spain, but comparatively low in Sweden. The coefficient of variation (CV) of recorded species number differed between countries being lowest in Sweden and highest in Spain. In general, the CV dropped above a transect length of 400800 m, thus indicating an increase in statistical power. Assuming a non-parametric test for matched samples, power calculations were conducted with the raw count data and with log-transformed count data for comparison. When using log-transformed data, the required sample size to detect an effect was less than 10 transects per country or region (in order to detect a 10% loss of species or a decrease of 30% in total abundance). Specific subgroups of species, e.g. protected species or specific indicator groups, showed a higher variance, thus requiring a higher sample size to detect effects ranging from 12 to 16 transects (equivalent to 2129 working days per country and year). When using original, untransformed count data a considerably larger sample size would be needed. Actual time to be invested in field work differed between countries due to contrasting regional constraints and conditions. Nevertheless, the final monitoring effort in working days was similar between countries as the factors involved balanced out each other, in particular due to the differing year-to-year variations. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of an environmental monitoring programme in arable land using farmland butterflies across Europe. We present a suitable approach and guidelines as well as the necessary effort to be invested in future Europe-wide monitoring programmes of butterflies in agro-ecosystems, based on predictions of statistical power.

TI  - Determination of Population Development and Infestation Rate of The Beet Armyworm [Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)] in Sugarbeet Fields in Ilgn (Konya) District
AB  - This study was carried out in sugar beet fields (Centrum, Dger and Karaky) in the center of Ilgn, the district of Konya between the years of 2017-2018. With this study, it is aimed to determine infestation rate, the first adult emergence time, adult population abundance, adult population peaks and adult activity duration in nature, which are essential criteria required for the management of Beet armyworm [Spodoptera exigua (Lep. Noctuidae)] in Ilgn. The population development of S. exigua was monitored by sexual attractive pheromone traps. As a result of the study, it was determined that the adults of Spodoptera exigua were first caught in sexual attractive traps in the first half of May. In order to determine the infestation rate caused by the pest, weekly beans were sampled from the period of sugarbeet with 8-10 leaves. The adult population peaked twice during the all years, including June and July. The date when adults were caught in traps was in the first half of September every two years. With these results, it was determined that S. exigua adults were active in nature for at least four months (May-September). The average infestation rate of the fields in 2017-2018 was 0.0- 0.1%, 0.1- 0.1% in Dger and 0.2- 0.2% in Karaky, respectively. Although the population of the pest does not increase every year, it might create an outbreak in some years. It is recommended that our producers continuously monitor the population of the pest.

TI  - Two European Cornus L. feeding leafmining moths, Antispila petryi Martini, 1899, sp. rev. and A. treitschkiella (Fischer von Rslerstamm, 1843) (Lepidoptera, Heliozelidae) an unjustified synonymy and overlooked range expansion
AB  - Antispila treitschkiella (Fischer von Rslerstamm, 1843) and A. petryi Martini, 1899, sp. rev. were regarded as synonymous since 1978, but are shown to be two clearly separated species with different hostplants, life histories, DNA barcodes and morphology. Antispila treitschkiella feeds on Cornus mas L., is bivoltine, and has, by following its ornamentally planted host, greatly expanded its range in north-western Europe. In contrast A. petryi feeds on the widespread native C. sanguinea L., is univoltine, and is one of only two Antispila species previously resident in the British Isles, the Netherlands and northern Europe. Consequently, the increase in abundance of A. treitschkiella in the Netherlands since the early 1990s and in Great Britain in recent years must be regarded as part of a recent expansion into north-western Europe, whereas the native A. petryi is hardly expanding and less abundant. In Britain, detailed surveys of parks and living collections confirmed the monophagy of these two species. A search of British herbarium samples provided no evidence for an earlier date of establishment. Information on recognition of all stages, including DNA barcodes, and distribution is provided, and these two species are compared with the third European Cornus L. leafminer, A. metallella (Denis & Schiffermller, 1775).

TI  - Gumleaf skeletoniser Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera Nolidae) larval outbreaks occur in high rainfall Western Australian jarrah ( Eucalyptus marginata) forest after drought
AB  - Larvae of the gumleaf skeletoniser Uraba lugens Walker can be a severe defoliator of jarrah ( Eucalyptus marginata) forest in southwest Western Australia. Extensive outbreaks that developed in the summer of 2010/2011 affected more than 250 000 ha. Rainfall or temperature anomalies correlated over large distances can be a lead to regionally synchronous population dynamics of species. These are known as Moran effects and can result in extensive outbreaks. The effects of spatial variation in regional climate (as measured by dryness index, the ratio of annual pan evaporation and annual rainfall) on the magnitude of outbreak and equilibrium populations of U. lugens were examined using long-term monitoring data. The effects of temporal variation in regional temperature and rainfall anomalies on populations were examined. The coincidence of regional rainfall and temperature anomalies with regional outbreaks was investigated using permutation multivariate analysis of variance and canonical analysis of principal coordinates. Outbreaks resulting in severe defoliation are restricted to high rainfall areas of the southern jarrah forest region in southwest Western Australia. Outbreak years were warmer than years of no known outbreak, yet temperature anomalies were a poor predictor of known multiple outbreaks. Synchronous U. lugens outbreaks coincided with a combination of long-term (seven-year) drying trends and autumn and winter drought. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates analysis using rainfall anomalies correctly predicted multiple outbreaks in 70% of cases. While the mechanisms behind drought as a driver of U. lugens outbreaks are unresolved, U. lugens outbreak may be an early indicator of future lethal stress in jarrah forest. Early insect indicators of stress are likely to allow latitude for early management responses to ameliorate effects of long-term drought on economically and ecologically important tree species.

TI  - Ecological traits predict population changes in moths
AB  - Understanding the ecological traits which predispose species to local or global extinction allows for more effective pre-emptive conservation management interventions. Insect population declines are a major facet of the global biodiversity crisis, yet even in Europe they remain poorly understood. Here we identify traits linked to population trends in 'common and widespread' UK moths. Population trend data from the Rothamsted Research Insect Survey spanning 40 years was subject to classification and regression models to identify common traits among species experiencing a significant change in occurrence. Our final model had an accuracy of 76% and managed to predict declining species on 90% of occasions, but was less successful with increasing species. By far the most powerful predictor associated for declines was moth wingspan with large species declining more frequently. Preference for woody or herbaceous larval food sources, nocturnal photoperiod activity, and richness of habitats occupied also proved to be significantly associated with decline. Our results suggest that ecological traits can be reliably used to predict declines in moths, and that this model could be used for Data Deficient species, of which there are many.

TI  - Moth body size increases with elevation along a complete tropical elevational gradient for two hyperdiverse clades
AB  - The body size of an animal is probably its most important functional trait. For arthropods, environmental drivers of body size variation are still poorly documented and understood, especially in tropical regions. We use a unique dataset for two speciesrich, phylogenetically independent moth taxa (Lepidoptera Geometridae; Arctiinae), collected along an extensive tropical elevational gradient in Costa Rica, to investigate the correlates and possible causes of bodysize variation. We studied 15 047 specimens (794 species) of Geometridae and 4167 specimens (308 species) of Arctiinae to test the following hypotheses 1) body size increases with decreasing ambient temperature, as predicted by the temperaturesize rule; 2) body size increases with increasing rainfall and primary productivity, as predicted from considerations of starvation resistance; and 3) body size scales allometrically with wing area, as elevation increases, such that wing loading (the ratio of body size to wing area) decreases with increasing elevation to compensate for lower air density. To test these hypotheses, we examined forewing length as a proxy for body size in relation to ambient temperature, rainfall, vegetation index and elevation as explanatory variables in linear and polynomial spatial regression models. We analysed our data separately for males and females using two principal approaches mean forewing length of species at each site, and mean forewing length of complete local assemblages, weighted by abundance. Body size consistently increased with elevation in both taxa, both approaches, both sexes, and also within species. Temperature was the best predictor for this pattern (0.98 < r < 0.74), whereas body size was uncorrelated or weakly correlated with rainfall and enhanced vegetation index. Wing loading increased with elevation. Our results support the temperaturesize rule as an important mechanism for body size variation in arthropods along tropical elevational gradients, whereas starvation resistance and optimization of flight mechanics seem to be of minor importance.

TI  - Arctiini Leach, [1815] (Lepidoptera, Erebidae, Arctiinae) of the Brazilian Amazon. III - Subtribe Ctenuchina Kirby, 1837
AB  - The Ctenuchina moths comprise 874 New World species. Here we provide a list of Ctenuchina species from the Brazilian Amazon. The list was produced from specimens deposited in the most important Brazilian collections and from literature data. Nearly 31% (273) of the New World Ctenuchina species were recorded, including 28 new occurrences for the Brazilian Amazon. Santarm and Belm were the municipalities with the highest number of species records, with 139 and 88, respectively. The high number of Ctenuchina records in the Amazon is underestimated because this subtribe has never been sampled in the vast majority of the biome. This is a worrying scenario because the Amazon has the world highest absolute rate of forest reduction. To suggest efficient conservation policies for the Arctiinae fauna of Amazon, it is urgent to intensify the sampling effort in this biome.

TI  - Spatial patterns at host and forest stand scale and population regulation of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa
AB  - Different spatial processes are likely to generate variability at different scales. Thus, the explanation of patterns may be facilitated by knowledge about the spatial scales where variation in patterns occurs. In the present study, the link between spatial patterns of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa Den. & Schiff. (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae) at two different scales, as well as its population dynamics, was assessed., First, the spatial patterns of T. pityocampa population were assessed at the forest stand scale by surveying the distribution of larval colonies within the pine forest, indicative of adult dispersion. Second, egg-laying patterns across individual host-plants, indicative of female oviposition choices, were assessed, as well as their impact on the survival of immature stages., It was found that T. pityocampa presents a gregarious distribution in homogeneous pine forests, over distances of a few dozen metres. At the pine tree scale, females tend to aggregate their egg batches, whereas aggregation increases with population density. Natural enemies such as parasitoids do not appear to play an important role in regulating the population dynamics of the species. At the same time, aggregation in individual hosts leads to increased mortality in the period from hatching to the third instar, which is notable at high population densities., A patchy distribution in the landscape over short distances has a potentially positive effect on population dynamics of the species, avoiding the Allee effect, and allowing for a rapid increase in population, even where initial numbers are low, leading to localized outbreaks. At the same time, increased mortality as a result of egg-batch clumping at high population densities is a potential density-dependent mechanism of population regulation.

Understanding these phases, especially diapause termination, is vital for interpreting the life history of many insect species and for developing suitable predictive models of population dynamics. The pine processionary moth is a major defoliator of pine and a vertebrate health hazard in the Mediterranean region. This species can display either univoltine or semivoltine development, with a pupal diapause extending from a few months to several years, respectively. Although the ecological and applied importance of diapause is acknowledged, its physiological regulation in either case remains obscure. In the present study, we characterize pretermination, termination and posttermination phases of pupae developing as univoltine or remaining in prolonged diapause. Changes in metabolic activity are monitored continuously using thermocouples, comprising a novel method based on direct calorimetry, and periodically by use of O2 respirometry. The two methods clearly detect diapause termination in both types of pupae before any visible morphological or behavioural changes can be observed. Univoltine individuals are characterized by an increase in metabolic activity from pretermination through to termination and posttermination, ultimately resulting in emergence. Remarkably, a synchronous termination is observed in individuals that enter prolonged diapause instead of emerging; however, in these pupae, the increased metabolic activity is only transient. The present study represents a starting point toward understanding the ecophysiology of diapause development processes in the pupae of the pine processionary moth. The pupae of the pine processionary moth enter a short diapause after which they produce moths, whereas a variable proportion of them enters prolonged diapause.In the present study, changes in metabolic activity are monitored continuously using thermocouples and periodically using O2 respirometry.The two methods clearly detect diapause termination, which is synchronous in both univoltine and prolonged diapause individuals. Increased metabolic activity is only transient in diapausing pupae.

TI  - Seasonal variation in natural mortality factors of Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) in openfield tomato cultivation
AB  - The seasonal variation in natural mortality of phytophagous insects is determined by the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in agroecosystems. Knowledge regarding these factors throughout the year represents a key concern for IPM programmes. Seasonal population fluctuations of tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta, led to an investigation of its natural mortality factors during the rainy season when the population level is low and during the dry season when population peaks occur. The aim of this study was to verify the seasonal variation in T.absoluta mortality factors in tomato crops. Immature stages of T.absoluta were obtained from laboratoryrearing in the laboratory. These were taken to the field and monitored over two years. The mortality causes for each stage of insect development from egg to adult were assessed daily. Multiple biotic and abiotic mortality factors affected the immature T.absoluta stages such as rainfall, physiological disturbances, diseases, parasitoids and predators. The key T.absoluta mortality factor during summerspring was predation. In addition, larvae predation correlated positively with temperature, wind velocity, photoperiod and rainfall. Nevertheless, during winterfall, the key mortality factor was parasitism. Therefore, the critical stage for mortality was 3rd and 4thinstar larvae, being more vulnerable to natural control factors. Finally, the results showed the importance of vertical and horizontal action on natural mortality factors.

TI  - Flying between raindrops Strong seasonal turnover of several Lepidoptera groups in lowland rainforests of Mount Cameroon
AB  - Although seasonality in the tropics is often less pronounced than in temperate areas, tropical ecosystems show seasonal dynamics as well. Nevertheless, individual tropical insects' phenological patterns are still poorly understood, especially in the Afrotropics. To fill this gap, we investigated biodiversity patterns of Lepidoptera communities at three rainforest localities in the foothills of Mount Cameroon, West Africa, one of the wettest places in the world. Our multitaxa approach covered six lepidopteran groups (fruitfeeding butterflies and moths, the families Sphingidae, Saturniidae, and Eupterotidae, and the subfamily Arctiinae of Erebidae) with diverse life strategies. We sampled adults of the focal groups in three distinct seasons. Our sampling included standardized bait trapping (80 traps exposed for 10days per locality and season) and attraction by light (six full nights per locality and season). Altogether, our dataset comprised 20,576 specimens belonging to 559 (morpho)species of the focal groups. The biodiversity of Lepidoptera generally increased in the highdry season, and either increased (fruitfeeding moths, Arctiinae, Saturniidae) or decreased (butterflies, Sphingidae) in the transition to the wet season in particular groups. Simultaneously, we revealed a strong species turnover of fruitfeeding Lepidoptera and Arctiinae among the seasons, indicating relatively high specialization of these communities for particular seasons. Such temporal specialization can make the local communities of butterflies and moths especially sensitive to the expected seasonal perturbations caused by the global change. Because of the key role of Lepidoptera across trophic levels, such changes in their communities could strengthen this impact on entire tropical ecosystems. Seasonality patterns of several groups of Lepidoptera were investigated at the foothills of Mount Cameroon, West Africa, one of the wettest places worldwide. We revealed a strong species turnover of fruitfeeding Lepidoptera and Arctiinae among the seasons, indicating the existence of relatively high specialization of these communities for particular seasons.

TI  - Population dynamics of noctuid moths and damage forecasting in sugar beet
AB  - The most damaging Noctuidae pests in sugar beets in Croatia are classified into two groups based on the injuries that their larvae produce the cutting species ( Agrotis ipsilon and Agrotis segetum) and the surface-feeding species ( Mamestra brassicae, Lacanobia oleracea and Autographa gamma)., The flight activity of male moths was detected and monitored using traps baited with sex pheromone., The study aimed to determine the population dynamics of noctuid pests in sugar beet crops and to propose damage forecasts and thresholds based on male moths capture in pheromone traps in specific weather conditions., A strong positive correlation between captured male moths in pheromone traps and the level of damage to sugar beet crops was established. The population densities were extremely affected by the weather conditions that prevailed in the sugar beet growing period. If the weather conditions are not optimal, the population of the second generation of moths and larvae will be smaller, and the level of damage to plants will decrease accordingly., Thus, intensive monitoring of noctuid male moth flights and weather conditions in the sugar beet growing season enabled forecasting of future damage to a larger area, although visual inspections are necessary to plan insecticide applications.

TI  - Vertical and temporal variability in the probability of detection of fruit-feeding butterflies and moths ( Lepidoptera) in tropical forest
AB  - One important source of variation present in all biodiversity sampling protocols is species detection probability (i.e. the probability of observing a species, given that it is present at a site). In tropical forests, many species have very low probability of detection, and thus they can be easily overlooked. Measuring the detection probability (detectability) of these species is important to determine the sampling effort required to accurately record them. In the present study, the variation of detectability of fruit-feeding butterflies and moths between strata (understory vs. canopy), temporally across sampling months, and in relation to observed abundance were examined in the Amazon and Atlantic forests using models of logistic regression. These results enabled the estimation of the sampling effort required to detect a given fraction of the total assemblage. Species detectability was positively correlated with observed abundance for both butterflies and moths. In the Amazon, most species were more detectable in a specific stratum (canopy or understory). Biblidinae, Charaxinae and Satyrini showed temporal variation in detection probability in Atlantic Forest, with distinct peaks during July- August, November, and March. In contrast, Brassolini and Coeini showed peak detectability in January and March, respectively. The vertical and temporal variation in detection probability means that sampling effort must be applied strategically to the correct seasons and strata to improve the accuracy of results. The estimated minimum sampling effort to detect 70% of the species present in these tropical forests is 428 trap-days in Atlantic Forest and 1435 trap-days in the Central Amazon forest.

TI  - Distribution pattern and sequential sampling plan for spotted pod borer, Maruca vitrata (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera Crambidae) on pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan L
AB  - Spatial distribution of legume pod borer,Maruca vitrata(Fabricius) (Lepidoptera Crambidae) on Pusa 992 pigeon pea cultivar duringkharif(rainy season) 2011 and 2012 was analyzed through Taylor's power law (TPL) and Iwao's mean crowding (IMC) regression.M. vitrataexhibited an aggregated distribution pattern on the crop. The pooled data for the two years fitted well to the TPL (a= 1.05,b= 1.19,R2= 0.967) and the IMC ( = 0.17, = 1.124,R2= 0.99). The optimal sample sizes with the TPL parameters increased with an increased precision level. Based on the TPL parameters, the decision lines of sequential sampling forM. vitratawere determined to bed= 3n 2.5n. The sequential sampling plan would economize decision-making for an effective management ofM. vitrata.

TI  - Planting window requirements for Bt cotton in Australia do they limit the exposure of H elicoverpa spp. ( Lepidoptera Noctuidae) to Bt toxins?
AB  - The threat of Bt resistance in H elicoverpa armigera (Hbner 1808) and H . punctigera (Wallengren 1860) ( Heliothinae) is a major impediment to the sustainability of transgenic ( Bt) cotton crops in Australia. A resistance management plan has, therefore, been instigated that in part requires farmers to sow their Bt cotton within specified dates to limit the number of generations of H elicoverpa spp. that are exposed to Bt toxins during the growing season. This study evaluated this strategy by utilising industry-wide databases of planting dates and other cropping/pest management events throughout 11 growing seasons. The analysis included model predictions of when H elicoverpa is likely to enter winter (pupal) diapause and emerge as moths in spring, and the long-term pheromone trapping records of moths. In New South Wales and southern Queensland ( Qld), most first-generation moths were caught at the same time, or before, cotton was planted (mostly in October). This generation was, therefore, unlikely to have been exposed significantly to Bt toxins as feeding larvae in spring, but some individuals (especially H . armigera) may have been exposed to Bt prior to pupating in the previous autumn. Three subsequent generations, which could have been exposed to Bt during summer-autumn, were recognisable in trap catches before moths became very rare in early April. By then, the majority of H elicoverpa had entered winter diapause as pupae and cotton harvest was well underway. We conclude that the current planting window (pre-mid- November in these regions) achieves little in limiting the exposure of H elicoverpa to Bt. However, insufficient is known of the population dynamics of H elicoverpa in central Qld to be as definitive about the need for planting windows there. Importantly, H elicoverpa are active all year round in central Qld and cotton can be grown over a longer period, thus increasing the risks of greater exposure to Bt.

TI  - Recovering More than Tree Cover Herbivores and Herbivory in a Restored Tropical Dry Forest
AB  - Intense and chronic disturbance may arrest natural succession, reduce environmental quality and lead to ecological interaction losses. Where natural succession does not occur, ecological restoration aims to accelerate this process. While plant establishment and diversity is promoted by restoration, few studies have evaluated the effect of restoration activities on ecological processes and animal diversity. This study assessed herbivory and lepidopteran diversity associated with two pioneer tree species growing in 4-year-old experimental restoration plots in a tropical dry forest at Sierra de Huautla, in Morelos, Mexico. The study was carried out during the rainy season of 2010 (July-October) in eleven 50 x 50 m plots in three different habitats cattle-excluded, cattle-excluded with restoration plantings, and cattle grazing plots. At the beginning of the rainy season, 10 juveniles of Heliocarpus pallidus (Malvaceae) and Ipomoea pauciflora (Convolvulaceae) were selected in each plot (N = 110 trees). Herbivory was measured in 10 leaves per plant at the end of the rainy season. To evaluate richness and abundance of lepidopteran larvae, all plants were surveyed monthly. Herbivory was similar among habitats and I. pauciflora showed a higher percentage of herbivory. A total of 868 lepidopteran larvae from 65 morphospecies were recorded. The family with the highest number of morphospecies (9 sp.) was Geometridae, while the most abundant family was Saturnidae, with 427 individuals. Lepidopteran richness and abundance were significantly higher in H. pallidus than in I. pauciflora. Lepidopteran richness was significantly higher in the cattle-excluded plots, while abundance was significantly higher in the non-excluded plots. After four years of cattle exclusion and the establishment of plantings, lepidopteran richness increased 20 fold in the excluded plots compared to the disturbed areas, whereas herbivory levels were equally high in both restored and disturbed sites. Restoration with plantings and exclusion of cattle and plantings was shown to be a successful strategy for attracting lepidopterans and cattle exclusion was the main factor explaining lepidopteran diversity.

TI  - Determination of sex pheromone traps distances in control of spiny bollworm, Earias insulana Boisduval. (Lep. Noctuidae) by mass trapping method in cotton fields
AB  - Spiny bollworm,Earias insulanaBoisduval. (Lep. Noctuidae), causes huge losses to cotton crops each year. As a relatively hardy species of insect,E. insulanatolerates a wide range of environmental conditions and so is prevalent in many regions of the world. Effect of sex pheromone traps to control spiny bollworm by mass trapping method was studied. Investigation of monthly changes in captures in relation to temperature carried out during 2012 in the Darab region of the Fars Province of Iran. The experiment was carried out in randomised complete blocks design with four treatments and four replications. The treatments used application of the sex pheromone trap at the rates of 16, 20, 24 and 30 traps/ha. The captured male moths were collected and counted every three days. Analysis of the variance of results showed significant differences between time and trap number in the trapping values ofE. insulana. Moth populations were observed in the second week of September. The highest and lowest captured insects per hectare were 30 and 16 traps/ha, respectively. The peak capturedE. insulanaadult males in the sampling period was on 18 November. These results enable forecasting of seasonalE. insulanapopulation peaks, providing additional information vital for the development of a successful, integrated pest-management programme for spiny bollworm.

TI  - Photoperiodic induction of prepupal diapause and its role in synchronization with host phenology in the hibiscus caterpillar, Xanthodes transversa
AB  - The hibiscus caterpillar, Xanthodes transversa (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), is a multivoltine insect that is an important pest of Malvaceae plants such as the okra, Abelmoschus esculentus, and the common rose mallow, Hibiscus mutabilis, in Japan. In the present study, the effects of photoperiod and temperature on the induction of prepupal diapause and the adaptive significance of this diapause were examined in a local population of X. transversa in Miyazaki, Kyushu, southwestern Japan. Larvae showed a long-day photoperiodic response for controlling the induction of prepupal diapause with a critical day length between 13 and 14 h at 20 to 25C. Under long-day conditions larvae rapidly pupated from the sixth instar, but under short-day conditions they entered diapause in the prepupal stage. Diapause occurrence in the field increased in late September, which was consistent with the laboratory results in terms of the photoperiodic response. Non-diapause development after this time is maladaptive because most larvae of the next generation could not reach the critical stage (prepupae) before winter and died during early winter in outdoor experiments. Larvae suffered from a high rate of mortality when fed leaves collected late in autumn. The photoperiodic response for controlling the induction of diapause in this insect may play an important role in synchronizing the life cycle with the seasonal changes in food and temperature conditions.

TI  - Seasonal decline of the tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta, in the shifting landscape of a vegetablegrowing area
AB  - Abstract Insect pest populations exhibit seasonal dynamics in response to changes in resource availability or other environmental factors such as climatic conditions, natural enemies, and intra or interspecific competition. Understanding such dynamics is critical for developing effective integrated pest management strategies. The objective of the present study was to identify factors driving the seasonal decline of the tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae), in the shifting landscape of a vegetablegrowing area in Senegal. A set of 42 tomato fields was monitored for the number of T.absoluta adults caught in pheromone traps and for the incidence of larvae, during 5months from June to November 2016 in the Niayes area (Senegal). The surface of solanaceous host crops, climatic conditions, and abundance of natural enemies were also monitored. A drastic decline in T.absoluta abundance was observed during the rainy season. The decrease in resource availability, especially tomato crops, in the surrounding landscape of monitored fields was the main factor affecting the population dynamics during the rainy season. However, alternative host crops such as eggplant and Ethiopian eggplant, can provide reservoirs for residual populations of the pest. For applied purpose, it would be interesting to focus the management efforts on residual populations during the rainy season, to make more difficult the reconstitution of populations during the dry season.

TI  - Integrative taxonomy reveals six new species related to the Mediterranean corn stalk borer Sesamia nonagrioides ( Lefbvre) ( Lepidoptera, Noctuidae, Sesamiina)
AB  - Species in the stem borer noctuid subtribe Sesamiina are notoriously difficult to distinguish because most related species have homogeneous wing patterns and almost indistinguishable genitalia. The latter is potentially problematic because this group includes several important pest species that are usually baregly distinguishable from non-pest species. In this study we focus on the Mediterranean corn stalk borer Sesamia nonagrioides ( Lefbvre), an important pest of maize with a wide area of distribution that covers most of Africa and extends to the south of Europe and western Asia. According to a recent study, this pest consists of three allopatric populations that were formerly considered as distinct species or subspecies. Here we rely on recent collections of 5470 specimens (sampled in 17 countries and 175 localities) that putatively belong to S. nonagrioides. Integrative taxonomy studies allowed us to unravel the existence of six new species that are closely related to S. nonagrioides and described in this paper. In contrast to S. nonagrioides these new species have more specific ecological preferences, as they are associated with a limited number of plant species and habitats. Dating and population genetic analyses carried out on 100 S. nonagrioides specimens also indicate a more complex population structure than previously thought for S. nonagrioides, which can probably be accounted for by late Cenozoic environmental changes. 2015 The Linnean Society of London [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society is the property of Oxford University Press / USA and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

TI  - Performance of the biocontrol agent Secusio extensa (Lepidoptera Erebidae) on its target host, Senecio madagascariensis (Madagascar fireweed), on an alternate host, Delairea odorata (Cape ivy), and on non-target plants, in Hawaii
AB  - The lepidopteran herbivore Secusio extensa (Erebidae Arctiinae) was purposefully released in Hawaii in 2013 to control Madagascar fireweed, Senecio madagascariensis (Asteraceae Senecioneae), an invasive weed of rangelands and other open areas. In conjunction with this biocontrol effort, we conducted pre- and post-release monitoring of S. madagascariensis in field plots, and post-release monitoring of non-target plants. Secusio extensa successfully established on the two islands where it was released, dispersed widely, and even colonized a neighboring island. However, in the first three years after release, S. extensa could only be found sporadically and in low abundances on its target host. In contrast, it underwent population outbreaks on the related, alternative host, Cape ivy ( Delairea odorata , Asteraceae Senecioneae), which is also a noxious weed in Hawaii. In addition to D. odorata , we observed S. extensa to feed on only two other related non-target plants in the tribe Senecioneae, among 24 species monitored. In several microsites supporting higher densities of S. extensa on S. madagascariensis , larval abundances peaked during a short period in the spring, but were insufficiently high to cause substantial damage to affected plants. The causes for low larval densities of S. extensa on its target host are unclear. We found no strong evidence for parasitism or predation of S. extensa larvae. However, females preferred to oviposit on D. odorata over S. madagascariensis , and larvae exhibited a marginally significant preference for feeding on D. odorata over S. madagascariensis . This preference, along with lower nutritional quality of S. madagascariensis relative to D. odorata , may explain why S. extensa has been unable to build large populations on its intended target, but has done so on an alternate host. Clarifying the roles of these mechanisms may help predict the continuing performance of S. extensa in controlling S. madagascariensis .

TI  - The Success of the Horse-Chestnut Leaf-Miner, Cameraria ohridella, in the UK Revealed with Hypothesis-Led Citizen Science
AB  - Citizen science is an increasingly popular way of undertaking research and simultaneously engaging people with science. However, most emphasis of citizen science in environmental science is on long-term monitoring. Here, we demonstrate the opportunities provided by short-term hypothesis-led citizen science. In 2010, we ran the Conker Tree Science project, in which over 3500 people in Great Britain provided data at a national scale of an insect (horse-chestnut leaf-mining moth, Cameraria ohridella) undergoing rapid range-expansion. We addressed two hypotheses, and found that (1) the levels of damage caused to leaves of the horse-chestnut tree, Aesculus hippocastanum, and (2) the level of attack by parasitoids of C. ohridella larvae were both greatest where C. ohridella had been present the longest. Specifically there was a rapid rise in leaf damage during the first three years that C. ohridella was present and only a slight rise thereafter, while estimated rates of parasitism (an index of true rates of parasitism) increased from 1.6 to 5.9% when the time C. ohridella had been present in a location increased from 3 to 6 years. We suggest that this increase is due to recruitment of native generalist parasitoids, rather than the adaptation or host-tracking of more specialized parasitoids, as appears to have occurred elsewhere in Europe. Most data collected by participants were accurate, but the counts of parasitoids from participants showed lower concordance with the counts from experts. We statistically modeled this bias and propagated this through our analyses. Bias-corrected estimates of parasitism were lower than those from the raw data, but the trends were similar in magnitude and significance. With appropriate checks for data quality, and statistically correcting for biases where necessary, hypothesis-led citizen science is a potentially powerful tool for carrying out scientific research across large spatial scales while simultaneously engaging many people with science.

TI  - Genetic Connectivity of the Moth Pollinated Tree Glionnetia sericea in a Highly Fragmented Habitat
AB  - Long-distance gene flow is thought to be one prerequisite for the persistence of plant species in fragmented environments. Human influences have led to severe fragmentation of native habitats in the Seychelles islands, with many species surviving only in small and isolated populations. The endangered Seychelles endemic tree Glionnetia sericea is restricted to altitudes between 450 m and 900 m where the native forest vegetation has been largely lost and replaced with exotic invasives over the last 200 years. This study explores the genetic and ecological consequences of population fragmentation in this species by analysing patterns of genetic diversity in a sample of adults, juveniles and seeds, and by using controlled pollination experiments. Our results show no decrease in genetic diversity and no increase in genetic structuring from adult to juvenile cohorts. Despite significant inbreeding in some populations, there is no evidence of higher inbreeding in juvenile cohorts relative to adults. A Bayesian structure analysis and a tentative paternity analysis indicate extensive historical and contemporary gene flow among remnant populations. Pollination experiments and a paternity analysis show that Glionnetia sericea is self-compatible. Nevertheless, outcrossing is present with 7% of mating events resulting from pollen transfer between populations. Artificial pollination provided no evidence for pollen limitation in isolated populations. The highly mobile and specialized hawkmoth pollinators (Agrius convolvuli and Cenophodes tamsi; Sphingidae) appear to promote extensive gene flow, thus mitigating the potential negative ecological and genetic effects of habitat fragmentation in this species. We conclude that contemporary gene flow is sufficient to maintain genetic connectivity in this rare and restricted Seychelles endemic, in contrast to other island endemic tree species with limited contemporary gene flow.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF WEATHER PARAMETERS ON POPULATION DYNAMICS OF APPLE CODLING MOTH Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera; Tortricidae) AT MATTA SWAT VALLEY
AB  - Study was carried out to investigate population dynamics and impact of abiotic factors (Temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) on traps catches of apple codling moth (Cydia pomonella) at Matta Swat in a single unmanaged orchard during the year 2012-13. The results of the field study revealed that the incidence of C. pomonella gradually showed increase in the 20th Standard Meteorological Week (SMW) where it reached to 7.00 and 3.00 moth/trap respectively in both years of studies. Afterwards, mean population of C. pomonella reached to its highest number of adults during the 25th SMW (11.25 moths/trap) in the year 2012 and 15.75 moths/trap in the 266h SMW in the 2013. Then the mean population fluctuation of C. pomonella gradually showed decline and reached to 7.00 and 8.00 moths/trap in both years in 29th SMW. After sharp rise and fall in the population again reached to its maximum level (12.00 and 13.00 moths/trap) in the 31st and 32nd SMW in the year 2012 and 2013 respectively. The lowest mean population of C. pomonella was recorded in the 38th SMW and 39th SMW (0.25 and 0.00 moths/ trap) respectively in both the years of studies. The correlation matrix between C. pomonella and weather parameters revealed that mean maximum temperature (r = 0.79 and 0.79) and mean minimum temperature (r = 0.44 and 0.42) exhibited a highly significant (p<0.01) positive association with C. pomonella population build up. Similarly mean Relative Humidity at morning also showed statistically significant (p<0.05) negative relation (r = -0.46) with C. pomonella population during the year 2012 and non-significant negative association (r = -0.28) with C. pomonella population during the year 2013. Statistically significant (p<0.05) negative association were recorded for the C. pomonella population with mean relative humidity at evening(r = -0.42) during the year 2012 and non-significant negative relation was recorded for the relative humidity at evening (r = -0.24) in the second year while total rainfall showed non-significant negative relationship ( r = -0.00 and -0.22) with C. pomonella population during both the years at Matta Swat. Regression analysis explained 68-82% (R) variability due to meteorological parameters in the population dynamics of C. pomonella at Matta Swat.

TI  - Biological characterization and mating compatibility of Helicoverpa gelotopoeon (D.) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) populations from different regions in Argentina
AB  - Helicoverpa gelotopoeon, the SouthAmerican bollworm, is a polyphagous pest of the Heliothinae complex that causes damage to soybean, cotton, and chickpea crops. Some species within this complex have developed resistance to genetically modified crops and insecticides, which has led to increased interest in their genetic diversity and population structure. The objective of this study was to characterize biological and reproductive parameters of two populations of H. gelotopoeon collected in two different provinces of Argentina. Intra- and inter-population crosses revealed that H. gelotopoeon populations from both regions of Argentina did not present evidence of pre-zygotic and post-zygotic incompatibility, suggesting that Tucumn and Crdoba populations of H. gelotopoeon belong to a single wide-ranging species. Our data support the occurrence of substantial gene flow between H. gelotopoeon populations, probably due to the widely documented, long-range migratory capacity of Heliothinae species.

TI  - Seasonal prevalence and histopathology of Beauveria bassiana infecting larvae of the leopard moth, Zeuzera pyrina L. (Lepidoptera Cossidae)
AB  - The natural epizootic potential of the fungus, Beauveria bassiana, against larvae of the leopard moth, Zeuzera pyrina L. (Lepidoptera Cossidae) was investigated under natural conditions in two different locations for two seasons (20152016 and 20162017) in Rasheed, Behiara Governorate, Egypt. In an orchard, located in the old cultivated land, Beauveria infected 1.95.6% of larvae of Z. pyrina in autumn (September to November), increased to 3.47.2% in winter (December to February). The infection did not exceed 3.1% in spring (March to May), and no infection was recorded in summer (June to August). While in an olive farm, located in a newly reclaimed land, in both seasons of survey, no infections were recorded from May to September, while in winter, the epizootics ranged from 1.43.1%, from 0.4 to 1.3% in spring, and from 0.3 to 2.1% in autumn. Histopathological analysis revealed that Beauveria most commonly penetrated larvae directly through the intersegmental integument and the first symptoms were observed 3 to 4 days later. Hyphae radiated inward from the point of ingress and the fungus developed sparsely within the body cavity prior to the death of the larva. Hyphal bodies were concentrated around the point of ingress, but some were found at distance from this site. Only in the vicinity of penetration, the hypodermis showed signs of histolysis. The saprophytic phase developed rapidly and the fungus invaded all internal organs. The conidiophores seemed to rupture the cuticle by mechanical pressure and emerged all over the host cadaver, with sporulation occurring 48 h later. Pathological changes in the hemolymph appeared to be the primary cause of larval mortality.

TI  - Spatial variability in the level of infestation of the leaves of horse chestnut by the horse chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) and in the number of adult moths and parasitoids emerging from leaf litter in an urban environment
AB  - The horse chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) was first recorded in Europe near lake Ohrid in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1985 since when it has spread throughout the whole of Europe. The reasons for its spread are well documented. The aim of this study was to assess the population density of the first generation of C. ohridella at eight sites in the urban area of esk Budjovice, Czech Republic in two consecutive years. The density was estimated visually in terms of the damage done to horse chestnut leaves by C. ohridella larvae at each site during the vegetative season. The results revealed high variability in the mean percentage of the leaf area damaged ranging from 1.43% to 31.00% and from 0.26% to 23.40% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The effect of site, year and interaction between these two factors were statistically highly significant. Spatial analysis revealed no autocorrelation in damage among sites indicating that the distribution of C. ohridella is random and not affected by the level of infestation at neighbouring sites. In autumn, samples of leaves were collected and the mortality of diapausing pupae of C. ohridella determined. It ranged from 12.50% to 25.82% and from 10.31% to 22.35% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. There was no significant effect of site and year and their interaction on pupal mortality. The leaf samples were then weighed and put into photo-eclectors, which were placed outdoors. Numbers of adults of C. ohridella and hymenopteran parasitoids that emerged in spring were recorded daily. There were statistically significant associations of the total number of adults that emerged from samples in spring with both site and year as well as their interaction. The number of moths that emerged was positively correlated with the damage done by the first generation of C. ohridella the previous year. Similarly, the total number of parasitoids that emerged was correlated with the number of moths that emerged. The implications of these findings for the optimization of C. ohridella control are discussed.

TI  - Genome Analysis and Genetic Stability of the Cryptophlebia leucotreta Granulovirus (CrleGV-SA) after 15 Years of Commercial Use as a Biopesticide
AB  - Thaumatotibia leucotreta Meyrick (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) is an indigenous pest in southern Africa which attacks citrus fruits and other crops. To control T. leucotreta in South Africa, an integrated pest management (IPM) programme incorporating the baculovirus Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (CrleGV-SA) as a biopesticide has been implemented. This study investigated the genetic stability of a commercially produced CrleGV-SA product that has been applied in the field since 2000. Seven representative full-genome sequences of the CrleGV-SA isolate spanning a 15-year period were generated and compared with one another. Several open reading frames (ORFs) were identified to have acquired single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) during the 15-year period, with three patterns observed and referred to as "stable", "reversion", and "unstable switching". Three insertion events were also identified, two of which occurred within ORFs. Pairwise multiple alignments of these sequences showed an identity ranging from 99.98% to 99.99%. Concentration-response bioassays comparing samples of CrleGV-SA from 2000 and 2015 showed an increase in virulence toward neonate T. leucotreta larvae. The CrleGV-SA genome sequence generated from the 2015 sample was compared to the Cape Verde reference genome, CrleGV-CV3. Several fusion events were identified between ORFs within these genomes. These sequences shared 96.7% pairwise identity, confirming that CrleGV-SA is a genetically distinct isolate. The results of this study indicate that the genome of CrleGV-SA has remained stable over many years, with implications for its continued use as a biopesticide in the field. Furthermore, the study describes the first complete baculovirus genome to be sequenced with the MinION (Oxford Nanopore, Oxford, UK) platform and the first complete genome sequence of the South African CrleGV isolate.

TI  - Seasonal Abundance and Spatial Distribution of Diaphania hyalinata (Lepidoptera Crambidae) on Yellow Squash in South Florida
AB  - Seasonal abundance and spatial distribution of melonworm, Diaphania hyalinata L. (Lepidoptera Crambidae), on yellow squash were studied during 4 crop-growing periods in 2014 in Homestead, Florida. The abundance of D. hyalinata larvae ranged from a minimum during Dec 2014 (1.3 0.0 larvae per 2 leaves) when temperatures were relatively low (15-20 C), to a maximum in Sep 2014 (6.6 0.1 larvae per 2 leaves) when temperatures were relatively high (24-26 C). The abundance of small larvae (L1 + L2) was relatively greater, with a maximum of 7.1 0.3 larvae per 2 leaves, as compared with medium-sized larvae (L3 + L4) (2.4 0.1 per 2 leaves) and large larvae (L5) (2.4 0.1 larvae per 2 leaves) throughout the year. The abundance of large larvae was consistently low over the entire year. Diaphania hyalinata distributions tended to be aggregated ( b > 1) during the crop-growing periods during May, Jun-Jul, and Sep 2014, when the population densities were relatively high, but were uniform ( b < 1) during Dec 2014, when the population densities were low. A weak but statistically significant positive linear relationship existed between temperature and larval abundance. The results from this study will help squash and cucurbit growers of south Florida in monitoring melonworm infestations in the field and in developing a knowledge-based management program.

TI  - Patterns of temporal and enemy niche use by a community of leaf cone moths ( Caloptilia) coexisting on maples ( Acer) as revealed by metabarcoding
AB  - The diversity of herbivorous insects is often considered a function of host plant diversity. However, recent research has uncovered many examples of closely related herbivores using the same host plant(s), suggesting that partitioning of host plants is not the only mechanism generating diversity. Herbivores sharing hosts may utilize different parts of the same plant, but such resource partitioning is often not apparent; hence, the factors that allow closely related herbivores to coexist are still largely undetermined. We examined whether partitioning of phenology or natural enemies may explain the coexistence of leaf cone moths ( Caloptilia; Gracillariidae) associated with maples ( Acer; Sapindaceae). Larval activity of 10 sympatric Caloptilia species found on nine maple species was monitored every 2-3 weeks for a total of 13 sampling events, and an exhaustive search for internal parasitoid wasps was conducted using high-throughput sequencing. Blocking primers were used to facilitate the detection of wasp larvae inside moth tissue. We found considerable phenological overlap among Caloptilia species, with two clear peaks in July and September-October. Coexisting Caloptilia species also had largely overlapping parasitoid communities; a total of 13 chalcid and ichneumon wasp species attacked Caloptilia in a nonspecific fashion at an overall parasitism rate of 46.4%. Although coexistence may be facilitated by factors not accounted for in this study, it appears that niche partitioning is not necessary for closely related herbivores to stably coexist on shared hosts. Co-occurrence without resource partitioning may provide an additional axis along which herbivorous insects attain increased species richness.

TI  - Broad-scale suppression of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), associated with Bt cotton crops in Northern New South Wales, Australia
AB  - The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a major pest of many agricultural crops in several countries, including Australia. Transgenic cotton, expressing a single Bt toxin, was first used in the 1990s to control H. armigera and other lepidopteran pests. Landscape scale or greater pest suppression has been reported in some countries using this technology. However, a long-term, broad-scale pheromone trapping program for H. armigera in a mixed cropping region in eastern Australia caught more moths during the deployment of single Bt toxin cotton (Ingard) (19962004) than in previous years. This response can be attributed, at least in part, to (1) a precautionary cap (30% of total cotton grown, by area) being applied to Ingard to restrict the development of Bt resistance in the pest, and (2) during the Ingard era, cotton production greatly increased (as did that of another host plant, sorghum) and H. armigera (in particular the 3rd and older generations) responded in concert with this increase in host plant availability. However, with the replacement of Ingard with Bollgard II cotton (containing two different Bt toxins) in 2005, and recovery of the cotton industry from prevailing drought, H. armigera failed to track increased host-plant supply and moth numbers decreased. Greater toxicity of the two gene product, introduction of no cap on Bt cotton proportion, and an increase in natural enemy abundance are suggested as the most likely mechanisms responsible for the suppression observed.

TI  - Long-term changes in the numbers of Helicoverpa punctigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in a cotton production landscape in northern New South Wales, Australia
AB  - Two noctuid moths, Helicoverpa punctigera and Helicoverpa armigera, are pests of several agricultural crops in Australia, most notably cotton. Cotton is a summer crop, grown predominantly in eastern Australia. The use of transgenic (Bt) cotton has reduced the damage caused by Helicoverpa spp., but the development of Bt resistance in these insects remains a threat. In the past, large populations of H. punctigera have built up in inland Australia, following autumn-winter rains. Moths have then migrated to the cropping regions in spring, when their inland host plants dried off. To determine if there have been any long-term changes in this pattern, pheromone traps were set for H. punctigera throughout a cropping landscape in northern New South Wales from 1992 to 2015. At least three generations of moths were caught from spring to autumn. The 1st generation (mostly spring migrants) was the most numerous. Trap captures varied between sites and decreased in time, especially for moths in the 1st generation. Nearby habitat type influenced the size of catch and there was some evidence that local weather also influenced the numbers of moths caught. There was no correlation between trap catches in the cropping region and rainfall in the inland. In addition, there was little evidence that Bt cotton has reduced the abundance of H. punctigera at landscape scale. The apparent decline in the number of presumably Bt susceptible moths arriving each spring in the cropping regions from inland habitats is of concern in relation to the management of Bt resistance.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamic climate model for Neoleucinodes elegantalis using CLIMEX
AB  - Seasonal variations are important components in understanding the ecology of insect population of crops. Ecological studies through modeling may be a useful tool for enhancing knowledge of seasonal patterns of insects on field crops as well as seasonal patterns of favorable climatic conditions for species. Recently CLIMEX, a semi-mechanistic niche model, was upgraded and enhanced to consider spatio-temporal dynamics of climate suitability through time. In this study, attempts were made to determine monthly variations of climate suitability for Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Guene) (Lepidoptera Crambidae) in five commercial tomato crop localities through the latest version of CLIMEX. We observed that N. elegantalis displays seasonality with increased abundance in tomato crops during summer and autumn, corresponding to the first 6 months of the year in monitored areas in this study. Our model demonstrated a strong accord between the CLIMEX weekly growth index (GI) and the density of N. elegantalis for this period, thus indicating a greater confidence in our model results. Our model shows a seasonal variability of climatic suitability for N. elegantalis and provides useful information for initiating methods for timely management, such as sampling strategies and control, during periods of high degree of suitability for N. elegantalis. In this study, we ensure that the simulation results are valid through our verification using field data.

TI  - MONITORING THE POPULATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE INFESTATION DENSITY OF TOMATO MOTH (TUTA ABSOLUTA MEYRICK) (LEP. GELECHIIDAE) IN GREENHOUSES
AB  - The adult population development and infestation ratio of Tomato Moth (Tuta absoluta Meyrick) were studied in umra (Konya) district in three tomato greenhouses in 2011 and 2012. Two sexual pheromone traps were placed in greenhouses to monitor population development. Infestation density of tomato leaf and fruit was determined on 100 tomato plants by visual examination method. The number of adults in the traps was examined and recorded weekly. Additionally, as the mass trapping technique, ferolite traps were used to control this pest. Four generations of T. absoluta were determined in greenhouses and maximum adult numbers on pheromone traps in first, second and third greenhouse were found as 640, 626 and 154, respectively. While infestation ratio of tomato leaves in each greenhouses were determined as 70%, 80% and 25%, fruit infestation ratios were 23, 25 and 5%, respectively. The maximum number of adult Tomato Moth in ferolite traps in the first and second greenhouse was as 1250 and 1525, respectively. Study results suggested that ferolite traps were found to be successfully used for mass trapping of the pest by decreasing adult population density.

TI  - Rapid spread of the tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae), an invasive pest in Sub-Saharan Africa
AB  - The invasive tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) has become a real threat for the continued production of tomatoes across Sub-Saharan Africa since its first detection in Senegal. However, little is known of its geographical expansion, seasonal population dynamics, and damage to crops. A trapping network was deployed in 2014 and 2015 in Senegal to monitor the dynamics of T. absoluta populations at a regional and nationwide scale. A field network was also implemented in the most infested area to get information on the pest incidence during the 2013-2014 cropping season. In 2014, pheromone traps did not detect the presence of T. absoluta moths in remote areas of Eastern Senegal. In 2015, moths were detected in all the fifteen monitored areas deployed throughout the country. Abundance of trapped moths was greatest in 'Niayes', the main tomato-producing area. Unexpectedly, T. absoluta moths were trapped in some areas with few or no tomato crops, including off-season in the 'Valle du fleuve', hot drylands ('Matam' and 'Kidira') and urban environments ('Dakar'). This suggests high mobility of moth populations and capacity to survive in harsh environments and to persist on alternative host plants. Field monitoring in the main tomato-producing area showed a very low incidence of T. absoluta over the early dry season (0-2% mined leaves), followed by severe outbreaks during the late dry season (up to 60% mined leaves). Results on the invasive pest occurrence will be helpful to decision-makers with a view to develop alternative strategies such as biological control by indigenous natural enemies or collective management strategies based on the temporal or spatial exclusion of host crops.

TI  - Parasitoids follow herbivorous insects to a novel host plant, generalist predators less so
AB  - The 'enemy-free space' hypothesis predicts that herbivorous insects can escape their natural enemies by switching to a novel host plant, with consequences for the evolution of host plant specialisation. However, if natural enemies follow herbivores to their novel host plants, enemy-free space may only be temporary. We tested this by studying the colonisation of the introduced tree Eucalyptus grandis (Hill) Maiden (Myrtaceae) by insects in Brazil, where various species of herbivores have added eucalyptus to their host plant range, which consists of native myrtaceous species such as guava. Some herbivores, for example, Thyrinteina leucoceraea Ringe (Lepidoptera Geometridae), cause outbreaks in eucalyptus plantations but not on guava, possibly because eucalyptus offers enemy-free space. We sampled herbivores (mainly Lepidoptera species) and natural enemies on eucalyptus and guava and assessed parasitism of Lepidoptera larvae on both host plant species during ca. 2 years. Overall, predators were encountered more frequently on guava than on eucalyptus. In contrast, parasitoids were encountered equally and parasitism rates of Lepidoptera larvae were similar on both host plants. This indicates that herbivores may escape some enemies by moving to a novel host plant. However, this escape may be temporary and may vary with time. We argue that studying temporal and spatial patterns of enemy-free space and the response of natural enemies to host use changes of their herbivorous prey is essential for understanding the role of natural enemies in the evolution of host plant use by herbivorous arthropods.

TI  - Annual Capture of Two Elachistidae Moth Species Using Stenoma catenifer Sex Pheromone in Criollo Avocado ( Persea americana) at Chiapas, Mexico
AB  - Native varieties of avocado ( Persea americana Mill) called 'Criollo' grow in Mexico, but little is known of their association with the seed borer moth, Stenoma catenifer (Walsingham). S. catenifer is the best-known pest of 'Hass' avocado fruit. The S. catenifer sex pheromone was used to capture male S. catenifer in Criollo avocado orchards at different elevations at Chiapas, Mexico from September 2012 to August 2013. Polynomial regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between numbers of moths caught and weather factors (precipitation and temperature). We thought temperature and precipitation might affect the moths captured. Initial S. catenifer captures coincided with crop flowering and presence of avocado fruit, independently of the altitude at the site. S. catenifer was caught frequently at the low-altitude site from December to January, while captures increased from February to May at higher altitude. Moths captured and precipitation were positively correlated at the low-altitude site; moths captured were correlated with temperature but not with rainfall at the high-altitude site. As expected, S. catenifer pheromone also attracted Antaeotricha nictitans (Zeller) in the avocado crop. Interestingly, A. nictitans was captured in all seasons, even in larger numbers than S. catenifer. A new unidentified moth species in the Elachistidae family was present from late May to 10 July and was more abundant at Site 2.

TI  - Clarifying the source of Conicofrontia sesamoides Hampson (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) population in South African sugarcane using morphological identification and mitochondrial DNA analysis
AB  - Valid identification of a novel pest species and clarifying its origin are the primary steps in understanding population structure and development of biocontrol programs. In this study geographical populations of Conicofrontia sesamoides Hampson (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) collected during surveys conducted in the years 2009, 2014 and 2015 were morphologically identified and their genetic diversity was analysed by using sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene in an attempt to examine host plant, or/and altitude associated differences among populations and determine the source of the newly recorded population of this species in the South African sugarcane. The C. sesamoides specimens in this study were collected from Miscanthus capensis (Nees) (Poaceae) and sugarcane ( Saccharum officinarum L.) (Poaceae) in Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces of South Africa. Analysis of Molecular Variance showed a moderate to highly significant genetic differentiation between C. sesamoides populations from different host plants (FST = 0.115, p = 0.14) and altitudinal range (FST = 0.159, p = 0.18). This result was however, contradictory to outcomes of phylogenetic analyses, haplotype networking and uncorrected sequence divergence (0.0-1.54%) which revealed no detectable genetic differentiation between populations from different host plants and altitudes. As it is difficult to measure FST accurately without a large data set, the very small sample used in the analysis might have resulted in inflation of the FST value in this study. After evaluation of the results, it was concluded that the sugarcane population of C. sesamoideshas originated from the population residing in wild host plants in the Eastern Cape and/or KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. Possible reasons for the host plant expansion and its implications to commercial sugarcane production in the country are discussed.

TI  - SEASONAL FLIGHT DYNAMICS OF THE POTATO TUBER MOTH PHTHORIMAEA OPERCULELLA (LEPIDOPTERA GELECHIIDAE) ON FLUE CURED TOBACCO
AB  - Phthorimaea operculella Zeller is one of the most destructive pests of potato and is becoming an important pest of other Solanaceous crops including tobacco. Hereby we report on a study of the seasonal flight dynamics of the pest on flue-cured tobacco crop in the region of Plovdiv in Bulgaria during 2008-2010. Male P. operculella were monitored using pheromone traps. Adults were present in the field from March through to the end of December even when tobacco was not present in the field. Flight activity started when the average weekly temperature rose above 6.3o C. An expanded flight period of the overwintering generation with low catch was observed from March to the beginning of June. The pest population started to build up from July. During the tobacco growing seasons of 2008 and 2009 the pest flight dynamics showed a similar pattern. The periods of the highest catches were from the end of July to the end of August, the end of September to the middle of October, and the middle of November. The rainfall during June-July 2010 reduced the density and changed the flight pattern. The Phthorimaea operculella population increased gradually over several months and two flight peaks were registered in the end of August and in October. The end of the flight activity in the temperate area was associated with the snowfall.

TI  - Effect of Seed Proteinaceous Extracts from Two Wheat Cultivars against Phthorimaea operculella (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) Digestive -amylase and Protease Activities
AB  - The potato tuberworm, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) is a worldwide pest of solanaceous crops. Larvae feed inside the galleries in foliage, stems and tubers which makes chemical control unsuccessful, and other control methods should be applied. In recent years many plants have received genes that encoding toxic proteins as a strategy to resist against insect pests. P. operculella is a solanaceous-specific pest and it has no evolutionary background with cereals. Therefore the goal of current study was to investigate the effect of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. MV17 and cv. Azar) seed proteinaceous extract against digestive -amylase and protease activities of potato tuberworm and was also to determinate the optimal pH of these enzymes using 1% starch and 2% azocasein as substrate, respectively. The optimum pH of -amylase and protease activities was found to be highly alkaline. Enzyme inhibition assays showed that amylase activity was significantly affected by extracts from MV17 and Azar at different pH values and maximum effect was observed at pH 9. The inhibitory effect of MV17 and Azar extracts on protease activity did not markedly vary between pH 8 and 11 and among pH 8, 9, and 11, respectively. Inhibition manner of various concentrations (1.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.187, and 0.093 (mg protein/ml) of extracts were dose-dependent. Maximum inhibitory effect occurred at the highest concentration and the minimum was at the lowest concentration. In polyacrylamide gel assay, both enzymes, without inhibitors showed two isozymes. At highest concentration of extracts, both bands disappeared or their intensity decreased. So, these proteins can be tested in producing resistant potato crops against potato tuberworm.

TI  - Northern geometrid forest pests (Lepidoptera Geometridae) hatch at lower temperatures than their southern conspecifics Implications of climate change
AB  - Climate change may facilitate shifts in the ranges and the spread of insect pests, but a warming climate may also affect herbivorous insects adversely if it disrupts the locally adapted synchrony between the phenology of insects and that of their host plant. The ability of a pest species to colonize new areas depends on its ability to adjust the timing of phenological events in its life cycle, particularly at high latitudes where there is marked seasonality in temperature and day length. Here we incubated eggs of three species of geometrid moth, Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata and Erannis defoliaria from different geographical populations (E. autumnata and O. brumata from Northern Finland, E. autumnata and E. defoliaria from Southern Finland and all three species from Germany) in a climate chamber at a constant temperature to determine the relative importance of geographic origin in the timing of egg hatch measured in terms of cumulative temperature sums (degree days above 5C, DD5); i.e. the relative importance of local adaptation versus phenotypic plasticity in the timing of egg hatch. In all three species, eggs from northern populations required a significantly lower temperature sum for hatching than eggs from southern populations, but the differences between them in temperature sum requirements varied considerably among species, with the differences being largest for the earliest hatching and northernmost species, E. autumnata, and smallest for the southern, late-hatching E. defoliaria. In addition, the difference in hatch timing between the E. autumnata eggs from Southern Finland and Germany was many times greater than the difference between the two Finnish populations of E. autumnata, despite the fact that the geographical distances between these populations is similar. We discuss how these differences in hatching time may be explained by the differences in hatch-budburst synchrony and its importance for different moth species and populations. We also briefly reflect on the significance of photoperiod, which is not affected by climate change. It is a controller that works parallel or in addition to temperature sum both for egg hatch in moths and bud burst of their host plants.

TI  - Biotic turnover rates during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition
AB  - The Northern Hemisphere is currently warming at the rate which is unprecedented during the Holocene. Quantitative palaeoclimatic records show that the most recent time in the geological history with comparable warming rates was during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (PHT) about 14,000 to 11,000 years ago. To better understand the biotic response to rapid temperature change, we explore the community turnover rates during the PHT by focusing on the Baltic region in the southeastern sector of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, where an exceptionally dense network on microfossil and macrofossil data that reflect the biotic community history are available. We further use a composite chironomid-based summer temperature reconstruction compiled specifically for our study region to calculate the rate of temperature change during the PHT. The fastest biotic turnover in the terrestrial and aquatic communities occurred during the Younger Dryas-Holocene shift at 11,700 years ago. This general shift in species composition was accompanied by regional extinctions, including disappearance of mammoth ( Mammuthus primigenius ) and reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ) and many arctic-alpine plant taxa, such as Dryas octopetala , Salix polaris and Saxifraga aizoides , from the region. This rapid biotic turnover rate occurred when the rate of warming was 0.17 C/decade, thus slightly lower than the current Northern Hemisphere warming of 0.2 C/decade. We therefore conclude that the Younger Dryas-Holocene shift with its rapid turnover rates and associated regional extinctions represents an important palaeoanalogue to the current high latitude warming and gives insights about the probable future turnover rates and patterns of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem change.

TI  - The Inhibitory Activity of Triticale, Rye and Black Nightshade Seed Proteinaceous Extracts against Potato Tuberworm Digestive -Amylase and Protease
AB  - Potato tuberworm, Phthorimaea operculella Zeller (Lepidoptera; Gelechiidae) is a worldwide pest of solanaceous crops. Larvae feed inside galleries in foliage, stems and tubers making chemical control unsuccessful, so other control methods should be applied. In recent years many plants have received genes that encode toxic proteins as a strategy to resist insect pests. In this study, optimal pH and temperature of digestive -amylase and protease activities of potato tuberworm and the effect of triticale (X Triticosecale wittmack cv.

Danko) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) seed proteinaceous extracts against enzymes activities were evaluated using starch 1% and azocasein 2% as a substrate, respectively. The optimum pH of -amylase and protease activities was found to be highly alkaline. Enzymes inhibition assays showed that amylase activity was significantly affected by extracts from triticale and rye by pH (P= 0.05; maximum effect at pH 9) and influencing of protease activity by extracts mentioned above did not vary by pHs 8-11 and 9-11, respectively. Extracts from black nightshade seed had no effect on enzymes activity. Inhibition manner of various concentrations; 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.187 and 0.093 (mg protein ml-1) of extracts were dose-dependent. Maximum inhibitory effect occurred at the highest concentration and the minimum was at the lowest concentration. In polyacrylamide gel assay, both enzymes, without inhibitors showed two isozymes, which at highest concentration of extracts, both bands disappeared or their intensity decreased. So, these proteins can be introduced to be encoded in producing resistant potato crops against potato tuberworm.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF SEX PHEROMONES AND FOOD ATTRACTANTS USED TO MONITOR AND CONTROL SYNANTHEDON MYOPAEFORMIS (LEPIDOPTERA SESIIDAE)
AB  - Synanthedon myopaeformis (Borkhausen, 1789) (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) is a prominent pest of commercial apple orchards in Europe. the sex pheromones of S. myopaeformis and food attractants based on apple juice, beer and red wine were evaluated as tools for monitoring and control the populations of S. myopaeformis in apple orchards in the Czech Republic. For monitoring S. myopaeformis flight activity, trap designs were also evaluated, and the results indicated that wing traps were more suitable than delta traps because of their high efficacy even at low population densities of S. myopaeformis. the flight activity patterns of S. myopaeformis showed high intrapopulation variability and variability between years. the use of pheromones as a mating disruption technique led to a decrease of tree injury in comparison to untreated controls during the three years of the experiment. the reduction of the number of S. myopaeformis larvae per tree on a 14-ha plot treated subjected to the mating disruption technique reached 56 % in the third year of the experiment. In the three-year experiment using food attractants for the mass trapping of S. myopaeformis, catches of S. myopaeformis in traps using a combination of beer and apple juice (5050) at a density of 4 traps/ha on a 4-ha plot increased more than 4-fold.

TI  - Reproductive Biology of the Federally Endangered Clematis morefieldii Kral (Ranunculaceae)
AB  - Successful management of rare plant species requires understanding of reproductive life history. To assess reproductive attrition, the status of all reproductive units (expressed in seven stages) on 40 plants at The Nature Conservancy's Keel Mountain Preserve (Madison County, Alabama) was recorded throughout 4 yr (2009-12). Floral herbivory by Lepidopteran larvae (Geometridae) and abortion of reproductive units was common, with few flower buds (< 12%) producing mature fruits and the greatest attrition occurring during the smallest flower bud stage. Reproductive output was positively correlated with peak growth season rainfall (April-June); plants produced more fruits in wet years (2009 and 2011) than in drought years (2010 and 2012). Postdispersal achene predation assessed in a high-density Clematis area and a low-density Clematis area reached 15% after 1 wk and increased to 30% after 4 mo but did not significantly differ between high-density and low-density areas. Germination was documented by planting achenes in cages in high-density and low-density areas. Seeds remained dormant the first year and germinated in significantly greater amounts the second year (23%) compared to the third year (9%) after planting. Germination did not differ between high-density and low-density areas. This study documented high levels of floral herbivory, demonstrated the importance of growing season rainfall, revealed moderate levels of postdispersal achene predation, and confirmed the existence of a short-lived seed bank. Land managers can use these results to design management strategies to boost reproductive success of plants in declining or small populations.

TI  - Placement Density and Longevity of Pheromone Traps for Monitoring of the Citrus Leafminer (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae)
AB  - The citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), is an important pest of all citrus varieties. Larvae damage young leaves, thereby reducing photosynthesis and tree vigor, and may impact yield. Wounds opened by P. citrella larvae may also increase susceptibility to citrus canker disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xanthomonadales Xanthomonadaceae). Sex pheromones coupled with appropriate traps are used as monitoring tools for this and other lepidopteran pests. Information compiled from trap captures is indicative of seasonal population fluctuations and may be used to guide management practices. Trap density and pheromone dispenser longevity are factors affecting the accuracy of trapping data. Our objectives were to evaluate capture of P. citrella in relation to trap density and duration under field conditions. Almost 2 yr of citrus leafminer monitoring demonstrated that a density of 1 trap per approximately 2 ha yielded similar results to the higher recommended density of 1 trap per 0.4 to 1.6 ha. Trap catch with the 2 pheromone brands tested declined by 25% after 3 to 6 wk and 50% after 6 to 10 wk during the spring through fall growing season in Florida. Therefore, correction factors are required if traps are replaced at 8 to 13 wk intervals. Results of the present study will help optimize monitoring programs that can serve as early warning of potential damaging populations of P. citrella. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] El minador de los ctricos, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), es una plaga importante en todas las variedades de este cultivo. El dao asociado a sus larvas al alimentarse sobre hojas tiernas reduce la capacidad fotosinttica del rbol as como su vigor, y puede afectar al rendimiento productivo. Adems, las heridas producidas por este minador incrementan la susceptibilidad de la planta al canker de los ctricos, enfermedad causada por la bacteria Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xanthomonadales Xanthomonadaceae). La utilizacin de atrayentes sexuales para trampas de captura es ampliamente utilizada en el monitoreo de esta y otras especies plaga de lepidpteros. La informacin recogida de esta manera permite conocer las fluctuaciones poblacionales de la especie monitoreada y por lo tanto, puede ser de gran utilidad para su gestin. La densidad de trampas y la longevidad del dispensador son factores que afectan a la precisin de los datos obtenidos. Nuestros objetivos fueron evaluar la captura de adultos de P. citrella en relacin a la densidad de trampas y duracin de dispensadores en condiciones de campo. Prcticamente dos aos de monitoreo demostraron que densidades de 1 trampa cada 2 ha produjo resultados similares a los obtenidos a la densidad recomendada de 1 trampa cada 0.4-1.6 ha. El nmero de capturas para las dos marcas de dispensadores evaluadas se redujo en un 25% despus de 3-6 semanas y en un 50% entre las 6 y 10 semanas entre primavera y otoo. Por lo tanto se necesita de factores de correccin si las trampas son reemplazadas en un intervalo de 8-13 semanas. Los resultados del presente estudio ayudarn a optimizar los programas de monitoreo que mediante esta tcnica pretenden reducir los daos potenciales asociados a P. citrella.

TI  - Egg mortality in the cedar processionary moth, Thaumetopoea bonjeani (Lepidoptera Notodontidae), in an outbreak area of Algeria
AB  - The cedar processionary moth,Thaumetopoea bonjeani(Lepidoptera Notodontidae), is one of the most serious pests ofCedrus atlanticain north-western Africa (Algeria and Morocco). We report onT. bonjeaniegg mortality and the diversity and abundance of parasitoids associated with its eggs in the area of Djurdjura Mountain (Tala-Guilef, Algeria). For this goal, 223 egg batches were collected fromC. atlanticaover two cohorts (2012 and 2013). The average number of eggs per egg batch increased from 143 in 2012 to 171 in 2013, while the egg mortality decreased from 47.4% and 23.9%, respectively, possibly because of a dilution effect. The most important factors of egg mortality were parasitoids and predators, with hymenopteran egg parasitoids killing from 12.1% to 34.9%, and predators from 5.2% to 7.4% of the eggs. The pattern of egg parasitism was driven largely byOoencyrtus pityocampae, accounting for about 94% of the total parasitoids, followed byBaryscapus servadeiiandTrichogramma embryophagum. An hyperparasitoidChartocerussp. was collected for the first time from eggs ofThaumetopoeaspecies. As the two major egg parasitoids are shared with the pine processionary mothThaumetopoea pityocampain the same area, it is likely that parasitoid abundance may depend on the occurrence of both hosts.

TI  - Early eclosion of overwintering cotton bollworm moths from warming temperatures accentuates yield loss in wheat
AB  - Understanding and predicting the impact of climate change on population demography, biotic interactions and ecosystem service is central to ecology. Long-term time series analysis of insect populations is crucial for analyzing the effect of climate change on plantinsect interactions in agro-ecological systems; yet such data are often lacking. Here, based on field experiments and the long-term time series of the overwintering adult cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) collected since 1975, we investigate the dynamic trend of H. armigera , as well as its driving forces and effects on the recruitment of H. armigera and crop yield. Results illustrated a shift to early eclosion of diapausing pupae due to global warming, extending the duration and abundance of adults in the overwintering generation. This then led to more larvae recruited in the first generation, and consequently damages the wheat at early growing stages. Our results suggest that the asynchronous effects of rising global surface temperature on the relative growth rate of spring crops and insect pests could intensify in the future, causing accentuated crop yield loss. To mitigate the adverse herbivore-mediated effect on crop yield in a warming climate, efficient cultivation measures and pest management are necessary, such as planting precocious crops with short growth period and timely control of insect pests.

TI  - Species From the Heliothinae Complex (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in Tucumn, Argentina, an Update of Geographical Distribution of Helicoverpa armigera
AB  - The Heliothinae complex in Argentina encompasses Helicoverpa gelotopoeon (Dyar), Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), Helicoverpa armigera (H bner), and Chloridea virescens (Fabricius). In Tucumn, the native species H. gelotopoeon is one of the most voracious soybean pests and also affects cotton and chickpea, even more in soybeanchickpea succession cropping systems. Differentiation of the Heliothinae complex in the egg, larva, and pupa stages is difficult. Therefore, the observation of the adult wing pattern design and male genitalia is useful to differentiate species. The objective of this study was to identify the species of the Heliothinae complex, determine population fluctuations of the Heliothinae complex in soybean and chickpea crops using male moths collected in pheromone traps in Tucuman province, and update the geographical distribution of H. armigera in Argentina. The species found were H. gelotopoeon, H. armigera, H. zea, and C. virescens. Regardless of province, county, crop, and year, the predominant species was H. gelotopoeon. Considering the population dynamics of H. gelotopoeon and H. armigera in chickpea and soybean crops, H. gelotopoeon was the most abundant species in both crops, in all years sampled, and the differences registered were significant. On the other hand, according to the Sistema Nacional Argentino de Vigilancia y Monitoreo de Plagas (SINAVIMO) database and our collections, H. armigera was recorded in eight provinces and 20 counties of Argentina, and its larvae were found on soybean, chickpea, sunflower crops and spiny plumeless thistle (Carduus acanthoides). This is the first report of H. armigera in sunflower and spiny plumeless thistle in Argentina.

TI  - Impacts of crop residue on damage by sugarcane pests during the tillering phase in Argentina
AB  - One of the most important recent changes in sugarcane cultural practices in Tucumn, Argentina, is the adoption of the practice of green-cane harvesting, which involves harvesting the sugarcane crop in the absence of burning. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the postharvest crop residue (also sometimes known as "trash blanket") on Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) and Pseudaletia unipuncta Haworth (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) population dynamics in sugarcane. The study was conducted in ratoon crops for 3 growing seasons (2011, 2012, and 2013) and at 3 locations in the state of Tucumn, Argentina. The treatments consisted of rows with the crop residue burned and the crop residue retained. Removal of the crop residue by burning, compared with retention, resulted in significantly greater crop damage by E. lignosellus in all locations and years. In contrast, damage by P. unipuncta was observed exclusively on plots where crop residue was retained. Comparing the pest status of 2 insects, E. lignosellus seems to be more consistently deleterious to sugarcane yield than P. unipuncta, and chemical control of this species is not very effective. Therefore, leaving the crop residue in place seems to be the most appropriate crop management approach, although it is important also to monitor P. unipuncta populations in order to implement control should it be necessary. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Uno de los cambios recientes ms importantes en el manejo del cultivo de la caa de azcar fue la adopcin de la cosecha "en verde". En este sistema, se cosecha el cultivo de caa de azcar sin quemar dejandro una cobertura de rastrojos sobre el suelo. El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar el efecto de la cobertura sobre la dinmica poblacional de Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Lepidotera Pyralidae) y Pseudaletia unipuncta Haworth (Lepidoptera Noctuidae). Se realiz el estudio en lotes con caa soca, durante tres campaas (2011, 2012 y 2013), en tres localidades de la provincia de Tucumn. Los tratamientos consistieron en dos tipos de manejo conservacin del rastrojo sin quemar y quema del rastrojo. Los niveles de dao correspondientes a cada plaga se determinaron mediante el muestreo de 6 puntos de 2 m de surco, en cada parcela. Para el anlisis de los datos se us ANOVA, y Test-t. Para E. lignosellus, la remocin del rastrojo mediante la quema result en niveles de dao significativamente mayores en todas las localidades y aos. Con respecto a P. unipuncta slo se observ niveles de dao significativos en el tratamiento con cobertura en todos los aos y localidades evaluadas. La frecuencia del dao de E. lignosellus y P. unipuncta fue del 100% en lotes con y sin quema del rastrojo, respectivamente. Comparando el status de plaga de ambas especies, los ataques de E. lignosellus son ms perjudiciales para el rendimiento de la caa de azcar que los ataques de P. unipuncta y su control qumico no es efectivo. Por esto, dejar el rastrojo en superficie sera el manejo ms apropiado, realizando monitoreos de P. unipuncta para implementar medidas de control si fuera necesario.

TI  - Moth Fauna of Gageodo Island in the Southwestern Sea, Korean Peninsula, including Seven Unrecorded Species (Lepidoptera)
AB  - We surveyed moths on Gageodo island in the southwestern sea of the Korean Peninsula over three years (2009, 2012, 2013) and found a total of 253 species in 18 families. Geometridae had the greatest species richness, with 63 species, followed by Noctuidae, Erebidae, Crambidae and Sphingidae. The annual changes in species richness and abundance were not different and seasonal occurrence of species showed a unimodal pattern in which the numbers of species and individuals increased from April and May, peaked in June and decreased to September and October. Seven moth species (Pyralidae Herculia drabicilialis Yamanaka, Didia striatella (Inoue); Crambidae Clupeosoma pryeri (Butler), Demobotys pervulgalis (Hampson), Yezobotys dissimilis (Yamanaka), Syllepte cissalis Yamanaka; Erebidae Hypena sinuosa (Wileman)) are reported for the first time in Korea.

TI  - Sampling procedures and adult sex ratios in spruce budworm
AB  - Unbiased estimates of sex ratios that reflect local abundance of adult insects are practically difficult to obtain because many gender-specific behavioural adaptations differentially influence the catchability of males and females in commonly applied sampling procedures. Historic data on outbreak populations of spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens ( Lepidoptera Tortricidae), the major pest of conifers in Nearctic boreal forests, include dozens of sex ratio observations for 10 different sampling procedures; these data illustrate the importance of understanding the reproductive ecology of adults to contextualize sex ratio assessments. Sex ratios of resident adults (assessed by rearing field-collected pupae to adulthood or fogging host trees with insecticide) were not different from 11. Sex ratios of in-flight adults collected using Malaise traps or light traps deployed in tree canopies were consistently male-biased, which presumably reflects the higher level of flight activity for males relative to females. Sex ratios of moths captured outside the forest canopy (presumed migrants), in contrast, were consistently female-biased, a trend which is expected because females seeking oviposition sites are more likely to undergo migration than are males. The sex ratio among adults that died from natural causes (collected on drop trays) was not distinguishable from 11. In pre-outbreak (endemic) populations, sex ratios estimated by light trapping were much more strongly male-biased than in outbreak populations. This surprising result should, however, be interpreted with caution because little is known of reproductive ecology in endemic budworm populations.

TI  - What Moths Fly in Winter? The Assemblage of Moths Active in a Temperate Deciduous Forest During the Cold Season in Central Poland
AB  - The composition and seasonal dynamics of the moth assemblage active in a temperate deciduous forest of Central Poland in autumn and spring was studied in two seasons 2007/2008 and 2008/2009. The standard light trapping method was used and, in addition, tree trunks were searched for resting moths. 42 species of moths from six families were found using both methods. The family Geometridae was predominant in terms of the numbers of individuals collected. Two geometrid species - Alsophila aescularia and Operophtera brumata - were defined as characteristic of the assemblage investigated. Late autumn and spring were richest in the numbers of species, whereas the species diversity was the lowest in mid-winter. Regression analysis showed that a temperature rise increased the species diversity of Geometridae but that rising air pressure negatively affected the abundance of Noctuidae.

TI  - A Revised Calculation Method for Correcting Population Density in the Field A Case of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera Plutellidae)
AB  - In this paper, we introduce a revised model to estimate the corrected initial number of each life stage in field life tables of insect pest populations, with a case example of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera Plutellidae). To validate our revised model, we used life table data of P. xylostella from 9 field surveys conducted by the corresponding author in 1996. In these surveys, P. xylostella infestations had been monitored in fields of flowering Chinese cabbage, long white radish, butter cabbage, Shanghai pak choi, and Chinese kale to investigate the impact of different pest management methods on the pest populations. In the past, the numbers of individuals per life stage on any given sampling date were calculated based on sampling data of that particular date and an average temperature determined for the entire sampling period. In several cases, this approach produced unrealistic survival rates (above 100%) for certain life stages in the resulting life tables. This problem continued even after the model was adjusted by calculating the duration of each life stage based on the actual temperature measured on each sampling date (instead of using one average temperature for the entire period). With temperature being an important factor that (i) affects the development time of insect life stages and (ii) can be determined easily during field surveys, we previously hypothesized that including corrected initial numbers of each life stage on each sampling date based on an average of the temperature between the given sampling date and its preceding sampling date will result in realistic and precise life tables. Furthermore, to estimate accurate survival rates, we here hypothesized that (i) it is important to adjust and correct the numbers of life stages on a given sampling date by including the numbers of preceding life stages from a preceding sampling date (not from the given sampling date) in the model; and (ii) the development time of the preceding life stage will determine which sampling date needs to be included in the calculation. By re-constructing and comparing 9 life tables of P. xylostella populations according to the previous and the revised new model, we confirmed these hypotheses. The revised model will allow a precise and realistic evaluation of control efforts against diamondback moth and other insect pest infestations in agriculture.

(Lepidoptera Plutellidae). Para validar nuestro modelo revisado, se utilizaron datos de la tabla de vida de P. xylostella en 9 estudios de campo realizados por el autor durante 1996. En estos sondeos, las infestaciones de P. xylostella fueron controladas en los campos de repollo chino en floracin, rbano blanco largo, repollo de mantequilla, pak choi de Shanghai, y col crespa de china para investigar el impacto de los diferentes mtodos de manejo de plagas en poblaciones plaga. En el pasado, se calculaban el nmero de individuos por cada estadio de la vida en la fecha de muestreo determinada, basndose en los datos de muestreo de esa fecha en particular y el promedio de la temperatura determinado para todo el periodo de muestreo. En varios casos, este enfoque produce tasas de sobrevivencia poco realistas (por encima de 100%) para ciertas estadios de vida en las tablas de mortalidad resultantes. Este problema continu incluso despus de que el modelo se ajust mediante el clculo de la duracin de cada estadio de la vida sobre la base de la temperatura real medida en cada fecha de muestreo (en lugar de utilizar el promedio de la temperatura durante todo el perodo). Debido a que la temperatura es un factor importante que (i) afecta el tiempo de desarrollo de los estadios de la vida de los insectos y (ii) se puede determinar fcilmente durante los estudios de campo, como anteriormente hiptizaba que la inclusin de nmeros correctos iniciales de cada estadio de la vida para cada fecha del muestreo basado en el promedio de la temperatura entre la fecha de muestreo y la fecha de muestreo anterior resultar en una tabla de vida realista y precisa. Adems, para estimar la tasa de sobrevivencia precisa, de ahi la hiptesis de que es importante para ajustar y corregir el nmero de estadios de la vida en una fecha de muestreo dada incluyendo el nmero en cada estadio de la vida anteriores al partir de la fecha del muestreo anterior (no desde la fecha de muestreo dado) en el modelo. Al re-construir y comparar 9 tablas de vida de las poblaciones de P. xylostella de acuerdo con lo anterior y el nuevo modelo revisado, hemos confirmado esta hiptesis. El modelo revisado permitir una evaluacin precisa y realista de las actividades de lucha contra la polilla de la col y otras infestaciones de plagas de insectos en la agricultura.

TI  - Late Holocene beetle assemblages and environmental change in Gammelhemmet, northern Sweden
AB  - Analysis of insect fossil remains retrieved from a bog close to the abandoned farm at Gammelhemmet, near Lycksele in Swedish Lapland, enabled the reconstruction of environmental changes at the site over the last 2500 years. These results represent the first late Holocene palaeoentomological succession studied for insect remains in the Vsterbotten interior, and they provide new evidence for landscape change in the area. Around 2000 years ago, at the end of the early Iron Age, disappearance of the tree and leaf litter fauna and an increase in aquatic species indicate the expansion of wetlands in the area. Patches of a multi-aged mixed woodland with a diverse assemblage of forest-dwelling beetles succeeded the wetland ~1500 years ago, at the beginning of the late Iron Age. A marked change to open and drier conditions, and the presence of species often found in grassland and cultivated ground took place during the post-Medieval period. Our evidence indicates drainage of the area prior to the 18th century, placing the initiation of agricultural activities in Gammelhemmet earlier than the documentary record. Our research shows the potential of the use of fossil insects for understanding environmental change and also human impact on the landscape, even of limited scale, from natural contexts.

TI  - Phylogeographic evidence for a Florida panhandle-peninsula discontinuity in the distribution of Melitara prodenialis Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae), a native cactus-boring moth
AB  - Insects are highly underrepresented in the phylogeographic literature of the coastal plain region of the southeastern U.S., but they may contribute much to understanding the phylogeographic history of the area., The present study uses Melitara prodenialis Walker, a cactus-boring moth, to test two alternative hypotheses Pleistocene changes in environment and coastline associated with population geographic change resulted in (i) a homogeneous Florida, USA, population of M. prodenialis or (ii) isolated subpopulations that gave rise to genetic divergence between regions., Melitara prodenialis larvae were collected from 23 sites ( n = 42 larvae sampled). For each larva, a 791 bp sequence of the COI mitochondrial gene was sequenced. Bayesian and parsimony approaches were used to investigate relationships among haplotypes. Phylogeographic and demographic analyses were conducted to identify geographic patterns in haplotype diversity distribution and infer population dynamics over time. Bioclim climate variables from the last interglacial period and the present were used to assess the potential contribution of environmental conditions to phylogeographic patterns observed., Melitara prodenialis populations in the Florida panhandle and peninsula are distinct, and the geographic segregation between these regions is correlated with current and historic climate patterns., Results suggest that populations of M. prodenialis in the Florida peninsula have more recently expanded than those in the panhandle. These findings are consistent with M. prodenialis populations changing in size and distribution following land area and climatic shifts associated with North American cycles of glaciation, with panhandle and peninsula populations remaining segregated over the relevant timeframes.

TI  - Ban of a broad-spectrum insecticide in apple orchards effects on tortricid populations, management strategies, and fruit damage
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the ban of Gusathion (azinphosmethyl) as insecticide in Swedish apple orchards on tortricid moth population density and tortricid-induced crop damage. In addition, the effects on growers' management strategies, such as choice of spraying dates and alternative insecticide combinations, were studied. Populations of Adoxophyes orana, Archips podana, Archips rosana, Cydia pomonella, Pandemis heparana, Hedya nubiferana, and Spilonota ocellana were monitored using sex-pheromone traps during the four consecutive seasons of 2008-2011, with annual crop damage estimates made prior to harvest. Azinphosmethyl was banned after 2008. Significantly increasing population densities were observed in A. orana, A. podana, C. pomonella, and H. nubiferana, whereas correspondingly increasing crop damage was observed only in the case of C. pomonella. The growers' management strategies, with respect to number and timing of spray applications, did not change during the study period although the insecticides available after the ban were less persistent and more specific, i.e., either with primarily ovicidal or larvicidal effect. Analysis of a broad range of factors showed that temperatures during winter and spring, number and timing of insecticide applications, and usage of azinphosmethyl in 2008 were important factors affecting population size and the damage caused by the tortricid species studied.

TI  - Host plants record for tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) in Sudan
AB  - This paper presents the results from a survey that was carried out to determine the host plants of tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) in five States in Sudan. This survey was carried out in greenhouses and open-field vegetable production areas between the years 2011 and 2014 using pheromone traps. The survey showed that the main host plant of T. absoluta is tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum), but it also attacks potato ( Solanum tuberosum), eggplant ( S. melongena) Jimson weed ( Datura stramonium) and S. dubium in the family Solanaceae, and broad bean ( Vicia faba) and alfalfa plant ( Medicago sativa) in the family Fabaceae. This paper is the first record of the following plans being hosts for T. absoluta Watermelon ( Citrullus lanatus) in the family Cucurbitaceae, Physic nut ( Jatropha curcas) in the family Euphorbiaceae, spiny amaranth ( Amaranthus spinosus) in the family Amaranthaceae, Ramtouk ( Xanthium brasilicum) in the family Asteraceae and S. dubium. The study showed that the leafminer male numbers and the symptoms were significantly increased in S. melongena and S. dubium after severe damage and complete loss of the main host, the tomato crop and these two species may be the preferred alternative host plants.

TI  - Range of a Palearctic uraniid moth Eversmannia exornata (Lepidoptera Uraniidae Epipleminae) was split in the Holocene, as evaluated using histone H1 and COI genes with reference to the Beringian disjunction in the genus Oreta (Lepidoptera Drepanidae)
AB  - Large-scale climatic cycling during the Pleistocene resulted in repeated split and fusion of species ranges in high northern latitudes. Disjunctions of ranges of some Eurasian species associated with nemoral communities used to be dated to 'glacial time', with existence of their contiguous ranges reconstructed not later than 1 mya, while a recent hypothesis associates them with the Boreal time of the Holocene and reconstructs the contiguous ranges ca 5 thousand years ago. These estimates differing by almost 3 orders of magnitude appealed for their testing via molecular methods. We made such a test for Eversmannia exornata (Lepidoptera Uraniidae Epipleminae), the only uraniid moth inhabiting Siberia, the range of which is split into three pieces East European, West Siberian and Far Eastern. Two genes were sequenced in specimens from one population from each geographical isolate a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxydase I (COI), frequently used for molecular phylogeny and barcoding, and a nuclear gene encoding histone H1. The COI gene fragment appeared to have two alleles differing by one synonymous substitution; both alleles co-occurring in the European population. The histone H1 gene had two dimorphic synonymous sites, with both variants of one site found in all three isolates. Absence of accumulated difference in both genes and polymorphism for the same synonymous substitution in the H1 gene in all three parts of the range suggests a very recent disjunction which cannot be resolved by coding gene sequences. This well corresponds to the Holocene disjunction hypothesis and rules out the Pliocene/early Pleistocene disjunction hypothesis. The published rate of the COI gene evolution was verified using the Beringian disjunction in the genus Oreta (Lepidoptera Drepaniidae) as comparing two northernmost Asian and one American species which diverged not later than the Pliocene. The rate of substitution accumulation in the histone H1 gene was estimated as 0.48 of that of the COI gene, that is ca 3.6 10 substitutions per site per year. Four indels were found in the histone H1 gene in the three Oreta species studied, differing from each other not less than with two indels.

TI  - Holocene environmental change in the Skallingen area, eastern North Greenland, based on a lacustrine record
AB  - A lacustrine record from a small lake, Lille Sneha S, in the Skallingen area indicates that the region was deglaciated in the early Holocene, prior to 8000 cal. a BP. Deglaciation was probably triggered by high temperatures, but it took more than 1000 years for the lake and the catchment to stabilize. Chironomids were amongst the first invertebrates to colonize the lake. The fossil chironomid assemblage is fairly rich and comparable to other records from further south in Greenland. The pioneer vegetation in the area consisted of mosses and herbaceous plants. The oldest remains of woody plants ( Salix arctica) are dated to c. 7700 cal. a BP, and remains of Dryas integrifolia appear at around 6700 cal. a BP; these are the only woody plants recorded. Maximum concentrations of chironomids, maximum occurrence of ephippia of the water flea Daphnia pulex, highest organic matter contents and lowest minerogenic input from c. 7700 to 4400 cal. a BP probably reflect the Holocene thermal maximum ( HTM). The highest temperatures during the HTM are indicated around 7000 cal. a BP, when Salix arctica, which is considered a warmth-loving plant, had a maximum. Comparisons with Holocene records from East and North Greenland show similar immigration histories and similar trends, with the Little Ice Age as the coldest period during the Holocene, culminating about 150 years ago. Subsequent warming does not indicate environmental conditions comparable to the HTM yet at this stage. The occurrence of several warmth-demanding species particularly in the early Holocene sediments indicates redeposition and implies that temperatures in the past, most likely during an interglacial period, were significantly higher than during the HTM.

TI  - ACCELERATING INFESTATION OF PINK BOLL WORM PECTINOPHORA GOSSYPIELLA {SAUNDERS){LEPIDOPTERA GELECHIIDAE) ON BT -VARIETIES OF COTTON IN PAKISTAN
AB  - Cotton Gosspium hirsu' tum L. is most important cash crop of Pakistan and important trade commodity of the world because of its exportability as well necessary domestic use. The cotton growers have to combat with an insect pest complex using different IPM techniques for successful cotton production. This fight was facilitated when the Lepidopterous pests ie. bollworms of cotton were managed by use of transgenic resistant varieties commonly known as Bt varieties/cultivars which have been registered for general sowing or which are commonly available to some farmers for sowing at his field. Use of these transgenic Bt cultivars has been so popular in farming community that area under these has rigorously increased, starting from nearly last 10 years, now Bt varieties have almost replaced the conventional non-Bt varieties (survey of >2000 farmers in district Lodhran). Bt cultivars worked satisfactorily for last many years except some limited and short duration problems of bollworms reported from different pockets, that were usually because of mixed seed. In last cotton season 2014, the infestation of pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) intensified tremendously and it was reported from almost all the cotton growing tract of Punjab. Owing to these reports studies were carried out in 3 subdivisions of Lodhran from 10 different Bt-varieties of cotton sown in that subdivision. 50 bolls were plucked from all the fields at random in the month of October, 2014. In total 1549 collected bolls were kept in paper bags for a week and then percentage of damaged bolls as well as number of live larvae were recorded from all samples. The results were alarming to note all of 17 cultivars collected for study were susceptible showing 24.49 % to 100 % infestation. The average intensity of alive larvae per boll was 109.6 % inside the infesteQ boll. The situation spells a serious threat and dem~nds the immediate attention of cotton growers, ' breeders, biotechnologists, seed prooucers, extension workers, entomologists and research workers.

TI  - Drivers of aggregation in a novel arboreal parasite the influence of host size and infra-populations
AB  - As a novel arboreal parasite, New Zealands largest endemic moth, Aenetus virescens , is a biological oddity. With arguably the most unusual lepidopteran life history on earth, larvae grow to 100 mm, spending 6 years as wood-boring parasites feeding on host tree phloem. Parasite fitness is a product of host suitability. Parasite discrimination between heterogeneous hosts in fragmented populations shapes parasite aggregation. We investigated whether A. virescens aggregation among hosts occurs randomly (target area effect), or if larvae select hosts based on host quality (ideal free distribution). Using long-term larval growth as an indicator of energy intake, we examined A. virescens aggregation in relation to host size and infra-population. Using a generalised linear model, the relationship between parasite intensity and host tree size was analysed. Reduced major axis regression was used to evaluate A. virescens growth after 1 year. Linear mixed-effects models inferred the influence of parasite infra-population on parasite growth, with host tree as a random factor. Results indicate parasite intensity scaled positively with host size. Furthermore, parasite growth remained consistent throughout ontogeny regardless of host size or parasite infra-population. Aenetus virescens aggregation among hosts violates the ideal free distribution hypothesis, occurring instead as a result of host size, supporting the target area effect.

TI  - Significance of the Larval Population Size of the Cereal Leafminer Syringopais temperatella Led. (Lepidoptera Scythrididae) and the Diapausing Depth in the Soil on the Yield Variables of Wheat and Barley
AB  - The cereal leafminer, Syringopais temperatella Led. is one of the most serious insect pests of wheat and barley in the Near East countries and their neighboring. Deep ploughing has negative impacts on soil-inhabiting pests. Therefore, it was of vital important to know the soil depth at which the pest larvae diapause to determine the right ploughing depth to facilitate pest control. Soil samples were collected at four different soil depths from a highly infested field and these samples were used to plant wheat and barley seeds in pots. Results revealed that foliage infestation percentage and larval population size in plant leaves were higher on plants grown in soil taken from deeper soil depths than shallower ones. Barley yield in the control treatment was significantly higher than those in the four soil depths, while for wheat, there were no significant differences in the yield among the soil depths treatments including the control. There was a reduction in the grain yield and in the dry straw mass of plants that were planted in soils taken from deeper depths since they contain larger numbers of pest larvae which attacked plant leaves after getting out of dormancy. Results also showed that the leaf infestation percentage was positively correlated with the larval population size in the soil; meanwhile, the grain yield and the dry straw mass were negatively correlated with the larval population size.

TI  - Modeling codling moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) phenology and predicting egg hatch in apple orchards of the Maule Region, Chile
AB  - Studies were conducted in the Maule Region to characterize the phenology of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) The Predictive Extension Timing Estimator (PETE) and a logistic phenological model were validated with eight data sets of cumulative moth catches in sex pheromone (PH) and kairomone-baited traps and the cumulative occurrence of fruit injuries from apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) orchards during the 2009-2011 seasons. Second, the start of egg hatch was predicted from the first sustained male and female moth catches (biofix) in traps baited with pear ester (PE), PE+acetic acid (AA), PE+PH, and PH alone. Both phenological models fit data well except that the logistic provided a better fit than the PETE model of the phenology of egg hatch of the codling moth in the first generation, with a difference of 11 d between models in the prediction of 50% egg hatch. No significant difference was found between biofix dates established for males using either PH or PE+PH lures or for the biofix date based on female catches with PE+AA or PH+PE. The biofix established with the sustained female catch occurred nearly 11d later than the male-based biofix. The use of a female biofix provided on average a 4-d improvement in the prediction of first egg hatch compared with the traditional use of a male biofix, but this difference was not significant. The use of PE+AA lures increased the proportion of cases when a female-based biofix could be established compared with the use of the PH+PE lure.

TI  - Deciphering host-parasitoid interactions and parasitism rates of crop pests using DNA metabarcoding
AB  - An accurate estimation of parasitism rates and diversity of parasitoids of crop insect pests is a prerequisite for exploring processes leading to efficient natural biocontrol. Traditional methods such as rearing have been often limited by taxonomic identification, insect mortality and intensive work, but the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques, such as DNA metabarcoding, is increasingly seen as a reliable and powerful alternative approach. Little has been done to explore the benefits of such an approach for estimating parasitism rates and parasitoid diversity in an agricultural context. In this study, we compared the composition of parasitoid species and parasitism rates between rearing and DNA metabarcoding of host eggs and larvae of the millet head miner, Heliocheilus albipunctella De Joannis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), collected from millet fields in Senegal. We first assessed the detection threshold for the main ten endoparasitoids, by sequencing PCR products obtained from artificial dilution gradients of the parasitoid DNAs in the host moth. We then assessed the potential of DNA metabarcoding for diagnosing parasitism rates in samples collected from the field. Under controlled conditions, our results showed that relatively small quantities of parasitoid DNA (0.07 ng) were successfully detected within an eight-fold larger quantity of host DNA. Parasitoid diversity and parasitism rate estimates were always higher for DNA metabarcoding than for host rearing. Furthermore, metabarcoding detected multi-parasitism, cryptic parasitoid species and differences in parasitism rates between two different sampling sites. Metabarcoding shows promise for gaining a clearer understanding of the importance and complexity of host-parasitoid interactions in agro-ecosystems, with a view to improving pest biocontrol strategies.

TI  - Macrolepidoptera biodiversity in Wooster, Ohio from 2001 through 2009
AB  - A Skinner mercury vapor light trap was operated from 2001 through 2009 in a residential backyard to document biodiversity within the moth families Thyatiridae, Drepanidae, Geometridae, Mimallonidae, Apatelodidae, Lasiocampidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae, Erebidae (including Lymantriinae and Arctiinae), Euteliidae, Nolidae, and Noctuidae. When making comparisons to older literature, we recalculated our results to conform to the older classification of the Noctuoidea. Moths were released after identification. There were 501 species documented in 77581 captures from 1290 sampling dates. There was a perceived risk that released moths would fly back into the trap the following evening. This should result in an abnormal number of rare moths that are caught multiple times. The number of species caught twice versus the number caught once was no different than a similar ratio for surveys that used more traditional sampling methods. Therefore this concern does not seem to be valid for these data. These data are provided in a supplementary file available for download. There were three previous surveys conducted in nearby natural areas. They documented fewer species than were documented here. To understand this better, we examined several specialized groups of moths that tend to use host plants not typically found in an urban residential yard. More species in Schinia Hbner, Catocala Schrank, Acronicta Ochsenheimer, and Herminiinae Leech were found in this survey than the other local surveys. Only in the Papaipema Smith did we recover fewer species, though it was still above 70% of what was expected. This diversity could be a result of sampling effort, but it shows that this urban location has a very diverse moth fauna. We suggest that this diversity is partly due to the planting of native plant species in the area about the light trap. Therefore we would concur with others that urban landscapes can be planned to increase biodiversity relevant to more natural ecosystems. In this study we looked at the ratio of the number of species of Geometridae divided by the number of species of Noctuidae as one approach to evaluating the level of disturbance in the moth assemblage. Although the yearly average was nearly constant, the seasonal ratio ranged from 0.09 to 0.91 depending on the sampling date. We also calculated alpha diversity and found that seasonal change in alpha diversity greatly exceeded yearly differences. This strong seasonal component means that a comparison between two studies requires a correction for seasonality and similar sampling intervals. In this study, a shift of two weeks would be sufficient to result in a significant difference in alpha diversity. This is the equivalent of increasing temperature by 1.53 C. Seasonal shifts limit the usefulness of this methodology for environmental assessment because the within season change exceeds the between season change. This problem is compounded when sampling designs interact with this seasonality. In describing our data, we made use of a growing degree day (GDD) model. This approach corrects for simple temperature dependent shifts in moth biology. Consequently, some of the variability in the data was removed, which should improve the power of statistical tests involving survey data. If sampling protocols were based on growing degree days rather than calendar dates, the bias caused by temperature induced shifts in seasonal cycles could be reduced.

TI  - Current temporal trends in moth abundance are counter to predicted effects of climate change in an assemblage of subarctic forest moths
AB  - Changes in climate are influencing the distribution and abundance of the world's biota, with significant consequences for biological diversity and ecosystem processes. Recent work has raised concern that populations of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) may be particularly susceptible to population declines under environmental change. Moreover, effects of climate change may be especially pronounced in high latitude ecosystems. Here, we examine population dynamics in an assemblage of subarctic forest moths in Finnish Lapland to assess current trajectories of population change. Moth counts were made continuously over a period of 32 years using light traps. From 456 species recorded, 80 were sufficiently abundant for detailed analyses of their population dynamics. Climate records indicated rapid increases in temperature and winter precipitation at our study site during the sampling period. However, 90% of moth populations were stable (57%) or increasing (33%) over the same period of study. Nonetheless, current population trends do not appear to reflect positive responses to climate change. Rather, time-series models illustrated that the per capita rates of change of moth species were more frequently associated negatively than positively with climate change variables, even as their populations were increasing. For example, the per capita rates of change of 35% of microlepidoptera were associated negatively with climate change variables. Moth life-history traits were not generally strong predictors of current population change or associations with climate change variables. However, 60% of moth species that fed as larvae on resources other than living vascular plants (e.g. litter, lichen, mosses) were associated negatively with climate change variables in time-series models, suggesting that such species may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Overall, populations of subarctic forest moths in Finland are performing better than expected, and their populations appear buffered at present from potential deleterious effects of climate change by other ecological forces.

TI  - EFFICACIES OF FOUR PHEROMONE-BAITED TRAPS IN CAPTURING MALE HELICOVERPA (LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE) MOTHS IN NORTHERN FLORIDA
AB  - Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) is a serious pest of grain, row, and vegetable crops throughout much of the world, although it is currently not established in the United States. USDA-APHIS and the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey program are charged with the responsibility to monitor for this insect pest. The adult stage is the easiest to monitor using pheromone-baited traps. Traps must be easy to handle, portable and cost effective so that they can provide high quality specimens for identifiers. This study was conducted from spring through the fall in 2010 and 2011 to compare the trapping efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 4 pheromone-baited traps for male Helicoverpa moths. Over 11,600 Helicoverpa moths were captured, all identified as the corn earworm, H. zea (Boddie). The Pherocon 1C sticky trap generally captured the fewest number of males, while equal numbers of moths were captured in a wire cone, ScentryTM Heliothis, and Universal (Unitrap) Moth bucket trap when moderate populations were present. Wire cone traps performed statistically better when high populations were present. The sticky traps captured the highest number of non-target insects, most being ants, flies, and beetles. Overall, the average corn earworm per trap vs. cost ratio for bucket traps was higher than the other traps, suggesting that more moths per dollar would be captured using these traps. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) es una plaga importante de granos, cultivos en fila y hortalizas en una gran parte del mundo, aunque hasta ahora no se ha establecido en los Estados Unidos. El USDA-APHIS y el programa de Sondeo de Plagas Agrcolas Cooperativo tienen el cargo de responsabilidad de vigilar este insecto plaga. Las trampas usadas deben ser facil de manejar, porttil y rentable para que puedan proporcionar muestras de alta calidad para los identificadores. Se realiz estos estudios desde la primavera hasta el otoo del 2010 y 2011 para comparar la eficacia de la captura y la efectividad de costo de las cuatro trampas cebadas con feromonas para polillas Helicoverpa masculinas. Ms de 11,600 polillas Helicoverpa fueron capturadas, todas identificadas como el gusano elotero del maz, H. zea (Boddie). La trampa pegajosa 1C de Pherocon generalmente captur el menor nmero de machos, mientras que el mismo nmero de polillas fueron capturadas en un cono de alambre, ScentryTM Heliothis, y la trampa de cubeta Universal (Unitrap) para polillas. Las trampas pegajosas capturan el mayor nmero de insectos no objetivo, de estos la mayora fueron hormigas, moscas y escarabajos. Todas las trampas fueron iguales en su capacidad para capturar por lo menos una polilla cuando las poblaciones fueron bajas. En general, el nmero promedio de gusanos del elote de maz por trampa comparado con la tasa del costo para las trampas cubetas fue mayor que las otras trampas, lo que sugiere que ms polillas por dlar seran capturados usando estas trampas.

TI  - Mating disruption of pea moth ( Cydia nigricana) in organic peas ( Pisum sativum)
AB  - We appraised mating disruption ( MD) to control pea moth, Cydia nigricana ( Fabricius) ( Lepidoptera Tortricidae), by assessing male attraction to monitor traps, larval pod infestation, and larval age structure in pheromone-treated and untreated grain pea fields [ Pisum sativum L. ( Fabaceae)], over a 5-year period. Cellulose pheromone dispensers were manually attached to the top shoots of pea plants and released 540 mg ha1 day1 synthetic pheromone E8, E10-dodecadien-1-yl acetate in a first test series (2000-2001) and ca. 4 200 mg pheromone ha1 day1 in a second series (2004-2006). The dispensers had a half-life of about 30 days. Although male attraction to pheromone monitoring traps was largely suppressed at the edges and within MD fields in both test series, MD treatments did not reduce pod infestation in the open field in 2000 and 2001. In the 2004-2006 series, larval damage reduction was achieved in the majority of the trials but overall MD efficacy in the open field was only 61% and not significant. In contrast, in field cages placed within the experimental sites and supplied with unmated pea moths, MD control was consistently high and significant. There were no obvious differences in the larval age distribution in all MD and control treatments, suggesting that infestations started and developed further similarly. As a univoltine species, C. nigricana larvae stay in the soil of pea fields for hibernation and pupate. The following year, emerging adults disperse and fly to the closest pea crop. Combined emergence site and pea crop treatments were conducted over 2 years to include this early migration phase of C. nigricana adults. However, the emergence site treatments did not enhance MD-control efficacy. We conclude that mating activity was only prevented in cage tests, whereas substantial mating occurred during the transit phase outside the pheromone-treated fields either within non-crop vegetation and/or at the edges of pheromone-treated pea fields orientated upwind. Thus, resulting gravid female entry can be regarded as the major constraint to reliable MD control.

TI  - Solving the puzzle of Pringleophaga - threatened, keystone detritivores in the sub-Antarctic
AB  - In the globally significant, lowland terrestrial systems of the sub-Antarctic's South Indian Ocean Province Islands, caterpillars of the flightless moth genus Pringleophaga (Lepidoptera Tineidae) are typically responsible for much nutrient turnover., On Marion Island, Pringleophaga marioni is a keystone species for this reason., Rising temperatures have led to increasing populations of introduced house mice, which, in turn, feed extensively on Pringleophaga caterpillars., Because of the caterpillars' keystone role, predation by mice is leading to changes in the functioning of the terrestrial system., Given the estimates of an extended life cycle duration for P. marioni (and its congeners), that is, two to more than 5 years, an ongoing puzzle is why the species has not shown greater population declines on Marion Island than have been recorded (in some habitats 40-97% in 20 years), given extremely high estimates of predation ( c. 1% of standing biomass per day)., One reason may be inaccurate previous estimates of life cycle duration for the species., Here, we provide a new, quantitative estimate, by rearing caterpillars at different temperature regimes (5, 10, 15 and 5-15 C), and combining these results with additional data from a prior study, to demonstrate that the life cycle duration for this species is approximately 1 year - half the previous minimum estimate., The new quantitative data provide grounds for improved models for estimating population persistence of this species, and information for models assessing the costs and benefits of conservation interventions such as the eradication of invasive house mice.

TI  - Photoperiodism of diapause induction and diapause termination in Ostrinia furnacalis
AB  - The Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guene) (Lepidoptera Crambidae), enters facultative diapause as fully grown larva in response to short-day conditions during the autumn. Photoperiodic response curves showed a stable critical daylength of ca. 13.5 h at 25, 28, and 30 C, which is nearly identical with the critical daylength between 13 h 22 min and 13 h 27 min in the field. The incidence of diapause obviously declined during ultra-long nights (14-22 h scotophases) and DD (i.e., constant darkness). The required day number (RDN) for a 50% response differed significantly between short- and long-night cycles at different temperatures, indicating that the effect of one short night was equivalent to the effect of three long nights at 25 and 28 C. The third instar was the stage most sensitive to the photoperiod. Night-interruption experiments with a 1-h light pulse at L9D15 and L12D12 exhibited a broad trough of diapause inhibition. In experiments using non-24-h light-dark cycles, only the cycles containing a long night of 12 h resulted in high incidence of diapause, regardless of the duration of the accompanying light period, indicating that the duration of the dark period was of greater importance than that of the light period. The Nanda-Hamner and Bnsow experiments in O. furnacalis did not show any rhythmic fluctuations with a period of ca. 24 h in their photoperiodic response curves; the incidence of diapause was low when the scotophase length exceeded 16 h. The rearing daylengths of 11 and 12 h evoked a greater intensity of diapause than did 13 h at 25 and 28 C. By transferring naturally overwintering larvae from natural conditions to a short photoperiod of L12D12 or a long photoperiod of L15D9 combined with 25 C, photoperiod appeared to have a significant influence on diapause development during the early phase of diapause. Field observations for 2 years revealed that pupation and adult emergence of overwintering individuals (50% responses) occurred in early May and mid-May, respectively.

TI  - Temporal relationship between genetic and warning signal variation in the aposematic wood tiger moth ( Parasemia plantaginis)
AB  - Many plants and animals advertise unpalatability through warning signals in the form of colour and shape. Variation in warning signals within local populations is not expected because they are subject to directional selection. However, mounting evidence of warning signal variation within local populations suggests that other selective forces may be acting. Moreover, different selective pressures may act on the individual components of a warning signal. At present, we have a limited understanding about how multiple selection processes operate simultaneously on warning signal components, and even less about their temporal and spatial dynamics. Here, we examined temporal variation of several wing warning signal components (colour, UV-reflectance, signal size and pattern) of two co-occurring colour morphs of the aposematic wood tiger moth ( Parasemia plantaginis). Sampling was carried out in four geographical regions over three consecutive years. We also evaluated each morph's temporal genetic structure by analysing mitochondrial sequence data and nuclear microsatellite markers. Our results revealed temporal differences between the morphs for most signal components measured. Moreover, variation occurred differently in the fore- and hindwings. We found no differences in the genetic structure between the morphs within years and regions, suggesting single local populations. However, local genetic structure fluctuated temporally. Negative correlations were found between variation produced by neutrally evolving genetic markers and those of the different signal components, indicating a non-neutral evolution for most warning signal components. Taken together, our results suggest that differential selection on warning signal components and fluctuating population structure can be one explanation for the maintenance of warning signal variation in this aposematic species.

TI  - Impact of some insecticides and their mixtures on the population of tomato borers, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) and Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in tomato crop at Upper Egypt
AB  - Impact of some insecticides and their mixtures (Emamectin benzoate, Imidaclopride, Chlorfenapyr, Indoxacarb, Profenofos, Pyridalyl, Methomyl and Teflubenzuron) were evaluated against the tomato borers,Tuta absoluta(Meyrick) andHelicoverpa armigera(Hbner) population in tomato crop at Upper Egypt. Results of LC50values indicated that Emamectin benzoate was the most toxic compound (LC500.461%) againstT. absoluta, larvae. The carbamate insecticide, Methomyl, followed this descending order, showing almost similar toxicity, while Teflubenzuron and Chlorfenapyr were less effective (LC501.054 and 3.165%, respectively). Pyridalyl was found to be the most effective insecticide against larval stage ofH. armigera. (LC500.513%). The corresponding toxicities of the other tested insecticides, arranged according to their LC50values in descending order were as follow Methomyl, Emamectin benzoate, Profenofos, Imidaclopride, Teflubenzuron, Indoxacarb and Chlorfenapyr. Their LC50values were ranged between (0.513 and 0.872%). While, their toxicity indexes were ranged between (92.432 and 58.830%, respectively). On the other hand, there were no differences occurred among the treatments. Mean of percent infestation was decreased sixweeks after six sprayings, and the per cent reduction in infestation was 79.73, 80.22, 78.41, 80.88, 80.50, 78.30, 79.64 and 78.25% using Emamectin benzoate, Methomyl, Imidaclopride, Pyridalyl, Profenofos, Indoxacarb, Teflubenzuron and Chlorfenapyr, respectively. The efficiency of the tested insecticides was increased with increasing the number of sprays from two to six causing reduction in insect borer infestation ranged between 68.02 and 80.88%, respectively. Generally, the tested insecticides and their mixtures achieved a considerable reduction inT. absolutaandH. armigerapopulation.

TI  - Age-stage, Two-sex Life Table of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on Different Bean Cultivars
AB  - The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner), is one of the important polyphagous pests causing serious loss to many economically important crops in Iran. The goal of this experiment was to study the age-stage, two-sex life table of H. armigera on different bean cultivars including white kidney bean (cultivars Daneshkadeh, Pak, and Shokufa), red kidney bean (cultivars Akhtar, Naz, and Sayyad) and common bean (cultivar Talash) under laboratory conditions (251C, 655% RH, a 168 h light-dark photoperiod). The longest and shortest larval period and development time of total preadult H. armigera were 19.833.83 and 37.580.90 days on red kidney bean Akhtar, respectively, and 14.130.32 and 31.820.42 days on white kidney bean Pak, respectively. The lowest intrinsic rate of increase (r) was on red kidney bean Akhtar (0.1150.009 day-1) and the highest on white kidney bean Pak and common bean Talash (0.1420.001 day- 1). The lowest and highest values of the net reproductive rate (R0) were on red kidney bean Akhtar (177.36.7 offspring) and white kidney bean Shokufa (270.16.7 offspring), respectively. The mean generation time (T) on different bean cultivars ranged from 37.030.05 to 44.640.07 days, which was shortest on white kidney bean Pak and longest on red kidney bean Akhtar. The results revealed that the cultivar Akhtar was the most unsuitable host for population growth of H. armigera.

TI  - Diyarbakr ili domates alanlarnda Domates gvesi [Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)]'nin poplasyon geliimi
AB  - This study was carried out with a view to determine population dynamics of tomato leaf miner [Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)] in tomato growing areas of Bismil and Ergani counties in Diyarbakr province between 2011 and 2012. For monitoring population development of tomato leaf miner one tomato field from each district was determined. According to the size of each field 1 sexual attractive trap for per acre (da) was hanged and studies carried out weekly from early seedlings period to the end of harvesting. Together with this study simultaneously tomato plants and fruits observed weekly by visual method to determine infection rate of pest. According to the results of this study, adult population dynamic in both years reached maximum level in 5 different time points (in July, August, September and October) in Bismil county, while reached maximum level in 3 different time points (in August, September and October) in Ergani county. The most number of T. absoluta adults on traps was determined as 429 adults/ trap in 04 August 2011and 529 adults/ trap in 15 October 2012 in Bismil county, while 251 adults/ trap in 20 October 2011 and 395 adults/ trap in 26 October 2012 in Ergani county. Tomato plants and fruits were highly infected with T. absoluta both years as 100 % in Bismil county, while this level was lower (60-90 % plants, 20-30 % fruits) in Ergani county.

TI  - Palaeoclimate records 608 ka in the Austrian and Swiss Alps and their forelands
AB  - The European Alps and their forelands provide a range of different archives and climate proxies for developing climate records in the time interval 608 thousand years (ka) ago. We review quantitative and semi-quantitative approaches for reconstructing climatic variables in the Austrian and Swiss sector of the Alpine region within this time interval. Available quantitative to semi-quantitative climate records in this region are mainly based on fossil assemblages of biota such as chironomids, cladocerans, coleopterans, diatoms and pollen preserved in lake sediments and peat, the analysis of oxygen isotopes in speleothems and lake sediment records, the reconstruction of past variations in treeline altitude, the reconstruction of past equilibrium line altitude and extent of glaciers based on geomorphological evidence, and the interpretation of past soil formation processes, dust deposition and permafrost as apparent in loess-palaeosol sequences. Palaeoclimate reconstructions in the Alpine region are affected by dating uncertainties increasing with age, the fragmentary nature of most of the available records, which typically only incorporate a fraction of the time interval of interest, and the limited replication of records within and between regions. Furthermore, there have been few attempts to cross-validate different approaches across this time interval to confirm reconstructed patterns of climatic change by several independent lines of evidence. Based on our review we identify a number of developments that would provide major advances for palaeoclimate reconstruction for the period 608 ka in the Alps and their forelands. These include (1) the compilation of individual, fragmentary records to longer and continuous reconstructions, (2) replication of climate records and the development of regional reconstructions for different parts of the Alps, (3) the cross-validation of different proxy-types and approaches, and (4) the reconstruction of past variations in climate gradients across the Alps and their forelands. Furthermore, the development of downscaled climate model runs for the Alpine region 608 ka, and of forward modelling approaches for climate proxies would expand the opportunities for quantitative assessments of climatic conditions in Europe within this time-interval.

TI  - Comparative performance of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on various host plants
AB  - The effect of various host plants; chickpea (varieties Arman, Hashem, Azad and Binivich), bean varieties ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.), common bean (Khomein), white kidney bean (Dehghan), red kidney bean (Goli), cowpea (variety Mashhad) and tomato (variety Meshkin) on the life table parameters of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) were evaluated under laboratory conditions (25 1 C, 65 5 % RH and a 168 h lightdark photoperiod). Records for larval period, pupal period, and development time of H. armigera were longest on tomato (24.9, 15.1, and 45.4 days, respectively) and shortest on chickpea Arman (17.5, 9.1, and 31.7 days, respectively). Among various host plants fecundity (total number of eggs laid per female) was highest (2,665 eggs) on chickpea Arman and the lowest (700 eggs) on tomato. The net reproductive rate ( R) was significantly affected by various host plants being highest on chickpea Arman (1,422) and lowest on tomato (111.3 females/female/generation). The highest and lowest intrinsic rates of natural increase ( r) were observed on chickpea Arman (0.244 day) and tomato (0.123 day) varieties, respectively. Cluster analysis of the life table parameters of H. armigera on various host plants indicated that tomato, in comparison to other plants was an unsuitable host to H. armigera.

TI  - Mariposas diurnas y nocturnas (Lepidoptera Papilionoidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae) del Parque Nacional Natural Gorgona, Pacfico Colombiano
AB  - Gorgona is a continental island at the Pacific coast of Colombia. For 26 years it was a prison but in 1986 it was declared a National Park, and the land was left aside for natural succession. This study presents a list of its Lepidoptera, compares it to a former study and discusses some ecological factors that could promote in situ biodiversity. Butterflies and moths were collected during three trips from October 2010 to May 2011. Butterfly observations were carried out along the main island paths. Baited traps using decomposed fruit, fish and chicken, were installed for three days at each zone (two kinds of bait per site) and sweep net catches were also made between 0900h and 1800h. For moths, black and white light traps were located in open areas. Town lights were also checked daily. Percent canopy cover was measured at each collection point. A total of 52 species belonging to seven families were found, of which 30 butterfly and 11 moth species are new records for the island. Cerro Trinidad and Sendero Chonta (22 and 20 species, respectively) were the richest places. Species richness did not decrease with canopy cover. Heliconious sara and Aeria eurimedia were the dominant species, but their distribution did not overlap. Three species were the most widely distributed in the island H. sara (11 sites, 166 individuals), Calycopis cerata (10 sites, 71 individuals) and Ae. eurimedia (nine sites, 72 individuals). Catoblepia xanthicles occidentalis was found 87 years after the last report. Most species accumulation curves were not asymptotic suggesting that the diversity of the island is higher than expected. This study found twice as much the number of butterflies species reported for Gorgona and is the first record of moths for the island. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Gorgona es una isla ubicada en la costa Pacfica de Colombia. Durante 26 aos fue una prisin, pero desde 1986 fue declarada Parque Nacional Natural, y desde entonces se encuentra en un proceso de sucesin natural. En este estudio se presenta una lista de los lepidpteros de isla Gorgona y se analizan algunos de los ecolgicos que podran promover la biodiversidad in situ de este grupo taxonmico. Se recolectaron mariposas y polillas durante tres viajes realizados entre octubre de 2010 y mayo de 2011. Las observaciones de las mariposas se realizaron a lo largo de los principales senderos de la isla. Se instalaron trampas cebadas con fruta, pescado y pollo descompuestos, durante tres das en cada zona de trabajo (dos tipos cebos por sitio) como tambin capturas con redes de entomolgicas entre las 0900h y 1800h. En el muestreo de las polillas se utilizaron trampas de luz blanca y luz negra en zonas abiertas, la luz se reflej sobre una pantalla blanca para maximizar la atraccin. Adems, se realizaron revisiones diarias en los alrededores de las luces artificiales del poblado. Se registr la cobertura del dosel del bosque en cada punto de muestreo. En total, se identificaron 52 especies pertenecientes a siete familias, de las cuales 31 de mariposa y 11 de polillas fueron nuevos registros para la isla. El Cerro Trinidad y el Sendero de la Chonta fueron los sitios de muestreo con mayor riqueza de especies (22 y 20, respectivamente). La riqueza de especies de mariposas no disminuy con la reduccin de la cobertura del dosel. Heliconious sara y Aeria eurimedia fueron las especies dominantes en nmero, pero su distribucin no se superpuso. Tres especies fueron las ms ampliamente distribuidas en la isla H. sara (11 siitios, 166 individuos), Calycopis cerata (10 sitios y 71 individuos) y Ae . eurimedia (9 sitios y 72 individuos). Se reporta Catoblepia xanthicles occidentalis despus de 87 aos. La mayora de las curvas de acumulacin de especies no fueron asintticas lo que sugiere que la diversidad de la isla es ms alta de lo esperado. Este estudio contribuy a incrementar en ms del doble el listado de especies de mariposas reportadas para isla Gorgona y contiene los primeros registros de Polillas para esta localidad.

TI  - Modeling the Habitat Retreat of the Rediscovered Endemic Hawaiian Moth Omiodes continuatalis Wallengren (Lepidoptera Crambidae)
AB  - Survey data over the last 100 years indicate that populations of the endemic Hawaiian leafroller moth, Omiodes continuatalis (Wallengren) (Lepidoptera Crambidae), have declined, and the species is extirpated from large portions of its original range. Declines have been attributed largely to the invasion of non-native parasitoid species into Hawaiian ecosystems. To quantify changes in O. continuatalis distribution, we applied the maximum entropy modeling approach using MAXENT. The model referenced historical (1892-1967) and current (2004-2008) survey data, to create predictive habitat suitability maps which illustrate the probability of occurrence of O. continuatalis based on historical data as contrasted with recent survey results. Probability of occurrence is predicted based on the association of biotic (vegetation) and abiotic (proxy of precipitation, proxy of temperature, elevation) environmental factors with 141 recent and historic survey locations, 38 of which O. continuatalis were collected from. Models built from the historical and recent surveys suggest habitat suitable for O. continuatalis has changed significantly over time, decreasing both in quantity and quality. We reference these data to examine the potential effects of non-native parasitoids as a factor in changing habitat suitability and range contraction for O. continuatalis. Synthesis and applications Our results suggest that the range of O. continuatalis, an endemic Hawaiian species of conservation concern, has shrunk as its environment has degraded. Although few range shifts have been previously demonstrated in insects, such contractions caused by pressure from introduced species may be important factors in insect extinctions.

TI  - Moth pests collected in light traps of tea plantations in North East India species composition, seasonality and effect of habitat type
AB  - Light trap has often been used in the ecological studies of lepidopteran insect pests in agroecosystems. However, the light trap in Indian agricultural systems is rarely adopted either to monitor the population size or to study the migration of moth pests. In the present study, we have installed light traps in shaded and unshaded tea plantations of North East (NE) India to study (1) the species composition, (2) effect of shade on moth pests, (3) seasonality of major pests and (4) to learn the sex proportion of major pests captured in light traps. The two-year catches in light traps suggested that Hyposidra talaca (Geometridae) is a major pest of tea in NE India. It peaks in number during winter months, with relatively few moths caught in the later parts of the year. Eterutia magnifera (Zygaenidae) is the second major pest of tea that peaks in number during summer months. Hyposidra infixaria, Buzura suppressaria, Ectropis obliqua, Ascotis sp. (all Geometridae) and Arctornis submarginata (Lymantridae) were caught in the light traps, but in low numbers. The catches also suggested that shade status has an important role on moth pest population in tea agroecosystems; shaded plantations received significantly higher number of moths of all major pests. The difference in the catches of H. talaca moths was significant among years. Pair-wise analysis suggests that the difference in the catches of H. talaca in corresponding standard meteorological weeks (SMWs) of two years was not significant for most of the SMWs, which confirms the inter-annual consistency in the life cycle and generations. Male moths constitute more than 77% of the overall catches of H. talaca. Overall, our results highlight that light trap is an effective, bias-free monitoring tool of moth pests of tea, which also captures the variability due to habitat type.

TI  - Interactions between hawkmoths and flowering plants in East Africa polyphagy and evolutionary specialization in an ecological context
AB  - Hawkmoths ( Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) are considered important pollinators in tropical regions, but the frequency and degree of reciprocal specialization of interactions between hawkmoths and flowers remain poorly understood. Detailed observations at two sites in Kenya over a two-year period indicate that adult hawkmoths are routinely polyphagous and opportunistic, regardless of their proboscis length. About 700 individuals of 13 hawkmoth species were observed visiting a wide range of plant species at the study sites, including 25 taxa that appear to be specifically adapted for pollination by hawkmoths. We estimate that 277 plant species in Kenya ( c. 4.61% of the total angiosperm flora) are adapted for pollination by hawkmoths. Floral tube lengths of these plants have a bimodal distribution, reflecting the existence of two hawkmoth guilds differing in tongue length. Hawkmoths exhibited strongly crepuscular foraging patterns with activity confined to a 20-min period at dusk and, in some cases, a similar period just before dawn. Corolla tube length appears to act as a mechanical filter as the longest-tubed plants were visited by the fewest hawkmoth species and these were exclusively from the long-tongued guild. Tube length showed a strong positive relationship with nectar volume, even after phylogenetic correction, which implies that plants with long corolla tubes are under selection to offer relatively large amounts of nectar to entice visits by polyphagous long-tongued hawkmoths. Our study shows that diffusely co-evolved pollination systems involving long-tongued hawkmoths are clearly asymmetrical, with plants exhibiting a high degree of floral specialization, while hawkmoths exhibit polyphagous behaviour. 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 199-213.

TI  - Evaluation of synthetic sex pheromone for monitoring and management of raspberry crown borer Pennisetia marginata ( Lepidoptera Sesiidae)
AB  - ( E, Z)-3,13-Octadecadienal ( E3, Z13-18Ald) was recently identified as a sex pheromone component of the raspberry crown borer Pennisetia marginata ( Harris) ( Lepidoptera Sesiidae). Although unstable, this pheromone may have utility for monitoring the seasonal abundance and flight phenology of adult P. marginata, as well as for developing control tactics, such as disorienting mate-seeking males. Experiments conducted in raspberry and blackberry crops tested the effect of lure and trap attributes on captures of male P. marginata., Increasing lure loads (10, 100 or 1000 g) of E3, Z13-18Ald significantly increased trap captures., Freshly prepared lures were significantly more attractive than lures aged for 2-10 days at room temperature., White wing traps and white delta traps were more effective than green delta or green bucket traps., Trap height in the crop canopy had no effect on the capture of males., When sex pheromone components of three other sesiid moth species were added to E3, Z13-18 Ald, the attraction of male P. marginata was reduced and, thus, these components were identified as pheromone antagonists., Pheromone-based mass trapping with 25 wing traps per hectare reduced captures of males in traps baited with a low-dose (10 g) pheromone lure by 67-87% in 2011.

TI  - Effects of landscape context and agricultural practices on the abundance of cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera in cotton fields A case study in northern Benin
AB  - Helicoverpa armigera(Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) is a polyphagous pest of global importance, threatening several key crops, including cotton. This study analysed the influence of landscape composition and agricultural practices on (i) the abundance ofH. armigeralarvae, and (ii) the proportion of infested plants (infestation) in cotton fields in northern Benin. In 2011 and 2012, the abundance ofH. armigerawas monitored during the rainy period, with weekly observations of 50 cotton plants in 20 fields selected each year. We selected cotton fields based upon the composition of the surrounding landscape (cotton, tomato and maize fields, and areas of natural vegetation) within 500metres radius buffers. We also recorded agricultural practices, included sowing date, crop rotation, and frequencies of weeding and of treatment with insecticides. In testing for a relationship between the pest problem and landscape and management, we fitted logistic multiple regression models and compared all the possible models using an information-theoretic approach. Cotton fields surrounded by cotton crops were found to have significantly higher infestation rates. Natural vegetation was positively correlated with the level of infestation. This study highlights the importance of considering both landscape variables and agricultural practices to improve strategies management ofH. armigera.

TI  - Impact of the leaf miner Cameraria ohridella ( Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) and bleeding canker disease on horse-chestnut direct effects and interaction
AB  - The leaf miner Cameraria ohridella and bleeding canker disease ( BCD) are invasive organisms causing severe damage to horse-chestnut trees in Europe., Their impact and potential interaction were investigated by monitoring infestation and disease symptoms on 193 European horse-chestnuts Aesculus hippocastanum L. and 46 red horse-chestnuts Aesculus carnea J. Zeyh. over a 10-year period from 2002 to 2012., Cameraria ohridella damaged up to 75% of the total leaf area of A. hippocastanum, but it had no influence on stem radial growth or general tree condition. Aesculus carnea was rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested A. hippocastanum., BCD, in contrast, was responsible for the death or removal of 11% of A. hippocastanum and 27% of A. carnea, and surviving trees showed a decrease in growth rate and decline in crown density., Cameraria ohridella was more abundant on larger A. hippocastanum, whereas BCD was more prevalent amongst young, fast-growing A. hippocastanum, which resulted in a partial separation of the moth and disease between trees and habitats, as well as in the wider environment., Trees with higher rates of leaf miner damage generally had a lower incidence of BCD and there was no evidence that C. ohridella either facilitated the spread of the disease or accentuated its impact.

TI  - Palaeoenvironmental Shifts Drove the Adaptive Radiation of a Noctuid Stemborer Tribe (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae, Apameini) in the Miocene
AB  - Between the late Oligocene and the early Miocene, climatic changes have shattered the faunal and floral communities and drove the apparition of new ecological niches. Grassland biomes began to supplant forestlands, thus favouring a large-scale ecosystem turnover. The independent adaptive radiations of several mammal lineages through the evolution of key innovations are classic examples of these changes. However, little is known concerning the evolutionary history of other herbivorous groups in relation with this modified environment. It is especially the case in phytophagous insect communities, which have been rarely studied in this context despite their ecological importance. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic and evolutionary patterns of grass-specialist moths from the species-rich tribe Apameini (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae). The molecular dating analyses carried out over the corresponding phylogenetic framework reveal an origin around 29 million years ago for the Apameini. Ancestral state reconstructions indicate (i) a potential Palaearctic origin of the tribe Apameini associated with a major dispersal event in Afrotropics for the subtribe Sesamiina; (ii) a recent colonization from Palaearctic of the New World and Oriental regions by several independent lineages; and (iii) an ancestral association of the tribe Apameini over grasses (Poaceae). Diversification analyses indicate that diversification rates have not remained constant during the evolution of the group, as underlined by a significant shift in diversification rates during the early Miocene. Interestingly, this age estimate is congruent with the development of grasslands at this time. Rather than clade ages, variations in diversification rates among genera better explain the current differences in species diversity. Our results underpin a potential adaptive radiation of these phytophagous moths with the family Poaceae in relation with the major environmental shifts that have occurred in the Miocene.

TI  - Genetic Diversity and Population Structure of Busseola segeta Bowden (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae) A Case Study of Host Use Diversification in Guineo-Congolian Rainforest Relic Area, Kenya
AB  - Habitat modification and fragmentation are considered as some of the factors that drive organism distribution and host use diversification. Indigenous African stem borer pests are thought to have diversified their host ranges to include maize [Zea mays L.] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] in response to their increased availability through extensive cultivation. However, management efforts have been geared towards reducing pest populations in the cultivated fields with few attempts to understand possible evolution of "new" pest species. Recovery and growing persistence of Busseola segeta Bowden on maize (Zea mays L.) in Kakamega called for studies on the role of wild host plants on the invasion of crops by wild borer species. A two-year survey was carried out in a small agricultural landscape along the edge of Kakamega forest (Kenya) to assess host range and population genetic structure of B. segeta. The larvae of B. segeta were found on nine different plant species with the majority occurring on maize and sorghum. Of forty cytochrome b haplotypes identified, twenty-three occurred in both wild and cultivated habitats. The moths appear to fly long distances across the habitats with genetic analyses revealing weak differentiation between hosts in different habitats (FST = 0.016; p = 0.015). However, there was strong evidence of variation in genetic composition between growing seasons in the wild habitat (FST = 0.060; p < 0.001) with emergence or disappearance of haplotypes between habitats. Busseola segeta is an example of a phytophagous insect that utilizes plants with a human induced distribution range, maize, but does not show evidence of host race formation or reduction of gene flow among populations using different hosts. However, B. segeta is capable of becoming an important pest in the area and the current low densities may be attributed to the general low infestation levels and presence of a wide range of alternative hosts in the area.

TI  - Spatial Ecology of the Palm-Leaf Skeletonizer, Homaledra sabelella (Lepidoptera Coleophoridae)
AB  - Understanding the processes that determine the distribution of populations is a fundamental goal in ecology. In this study, I determined the relative contribution of space and the biotic and abiotic environment to the distribution of the palm-leaf skeletonizer Homaledra sabalella (PLS; Lepidoptera Coleophoridae) among patchily distributed dwarf palmettos (Sabal minor; Arecaceae). Based on surveys conducted at two sites in the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, Louisiana, I found that the distribution of the PLS was primarily related to local environmental conditions - number of PLS increased with palmetto height, was greater in dry versus wet habitats, and varied in an inconsistent way with the type of understory cover. Spatial structure of the forest and isolation of the host plant were of minor importance to the distribution of the PLS. Based on a series of experiments, the mechanisms underlying the effects of these environmental variables on PLS abundance were elucidated. Tall palmettos have a greater abundance of PLS because they are 2.5 times more likely to be colonized than small palmettos. Tall palmettos do not represent better hosts (in terms of PLS survival to pupation, pupal length, or risk of parasitism). Similarly, an open understory increased colonization by two-fold, relative to a shrub understory, but understory type had no effect on host quality. Wet soils greatly reduced palmetto quality as a host (survival and pupal length), but only for the smallest palmettos (<0.75 m height). Finally, corroborating the survey data, my dispersal experiment revealed that the PLS is a strong flier and that local PLS populations (i.e., infested palmettos) are likely well connected by dispersal. I conclude by discussing how landscape-level changes at Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, owing to recent hurricane activity, could affect the risk of palmetto infestation by the PLS.

TI  - DNA Barcoding the Geometrid Fauna of Bavaria (Lepidoptera) Successes, Surprises, and Questions
AB  - Background The State of Bavaria is involved in a research program that will lead to the construction of a DNA barcode library for all animal species within its territorial boundaries. The present study provides a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the Geometridae, one of the most diverse of insect families. Methodology/Principal Findings This study reports DNA barcodes for 400 Bavarian geometrid species, 98 per cent of the known fauna, and approximately one per cent of all Bavarian animal species. Although 98.5% of these species possess diagnostic barcode sequences in Bavaria, records from neighbouring countries suggest that species-level resolution may be compromised in up to 3.5% of cases. All taxa which apparently share barcodes are discussed in detail. One case of modest divergence (1.4%) revealed a species overlooked by the current taxonomic system Eupithecia goossensiata Mabille, 1869 stat.n. is raised from synonymy with Eupithecia absinthiata (Clerck, 1759) to species rank. Deep intraspecific sequence divergences (.2%) were detected in 20 traditionally recognized species. Conclusions/Significance The study emphasizes the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity. Open access is provided to a data set that includes records for 1,395 geometrid specimens (331 species) from Bavaria, with 69 additional species from neighbouring regions. Taxa with deep intraspecific sequence divergences are undergoing more detailed analysis to ascertain if they represent cases of cryptic diversity.

TI  - Combining mitochondrial and nuclear evidences a refined evolutionary history of Erebia medusa (Lepidoptera Nymphalidae Satyrinae) in Central Europe based on the COI gene
AB  - We aim to infer a combined scenario for the evolution of the Woodland Ringlet, Erebia medusa, in Central Europe based on analyses of part of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxydase subunit I (COI) and a published allozyme data set. We sequenced 529 bp of COI for 158 butterflies from 32 populations from almost the entire western distribution range of the species. We applied population genetic [spatial analysis of molecular variance (samova)] and phylogeographical analyses as well as coalescence simulation to test if the published allozyme scenario supports or contradicts the observed haplotype distribution. We recorded 16 haplotypes of which four represent a total of 82%.samova grouped the 32 populations into four geographically coherent groups (1) western Central Europe, (2) Central Europe, (3) eastern Central Europe and (iv) western Pannonia. Mismatch distribution analyses and haplotype networks are in coincidence with constant population growth and reveal a relatively shallow phylogeographical structure. We evaluated the level of discordance between population histories and gene trees using Slatkins s and the deep coalescence statistics based on our mtDNA data. These estimators decline the previously published allozyme scenario of survival in different extra-Mediterranean refugia in Europe with an onset of differentiation at the beginning of the last ice age some 70 000 years ago. However, it supports a refined scenario if we assume an onset of vicariance driven differentiation in these refugia after the end of the middle Wrm interstadials some 30 000 years ago. Therefore, the general evolutionary history of this species in Europe apparently is very recent. Most probably, areas adjoining the high mountain regions as Alps and northern Carpathians were of great importance for the late Wrm glacial survival of species like Erebia medusa. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Zusammenfassung Wir streben die Erstellung eines kombinierten Evolutionsszenarios fr den Rundaugen-Mohrenfalter Erebia medusa in Mitteleuropa basierend auf der Analyse eines Teils der mitochondriellen Cytochromoxidase-Einheit I (COI) und publizierten Allozymdaten an. Hierfr sequenzierten wir 529 bp der COI fr 158 Schmetterlingsindividuen aus 32 Populationen ber das gesamte westliche Verbreitungsgebiet der Art. Wir nutzten populationsgenetische (samova) und phylogeographische Analysen sowie Koaleszenzsimulationen, um zu testen, ob das publizierte Allozymszenario durch die beobachtete Haplotypenverbreitung besttigt oder abgelehnt wird. Wir wiesen 16 Haplotypen nach, von denen vier einen Gesamtanteil von 82% besaen.samova gruppierte die 32 Populationen in vier geographisch kohrente Gruppen (1) westliches Mitteleuropa, (2) Mitteleuropa, (3) stliches Mitteleuropa und (4) westliches Pannonicum. Mismatch distribution Analysen und Haplotypennetzwerke stimmen mit der Annahme von konstantem Populationswachstum berein und deuten auf eine relative flache phylogeographische Struktur hin. Wir bewerteten das Niveau von Diskordanzen zwischen den mglichen Geschichten der Populationen und Genbumen, wobei wir Slatkins s und die deep coalescence Statistik basierend auf unseren mtDNA Daten nutzen. Diese Schtzer widersprechen dem zuvor publizierten Allozymszenario, welches berdauerung des gesamten letzten Glazials in verschiedenen extra-mediterranen Refugien in Europa mit einem Differenzierungsbeginn zu Beginn des letzten Glazials vor etwa 70 000 Jahren forderte. Die mtDNA Daten untersttzen jedoch ein modifiziertes Szenario, bei dem der durch Vikarianz hervorgerufene Differenzierungsbeginn in diesen Refugien nach Ende der Interstadiale des Mittelwrms vor 30 000 Jahren einsetzte. Folglich erscheint die generelle evolutionre Geschichte dieser Art in Europa sehr rezent. Hchstwahrscheinlich waren somit die Regionen, welche an die Alpen und die Nordkarpaten angrenzen, von grter Bedeutung fr das sptglaziale berdauern einer Art wie Erebia medusa.

TI  - Mis-Spliced Transcripts of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor 6 Are Associated with Field Evolved Spinosad Resistance in Plutella xylostella (L.)
AB  - The evolution of insecticide resistance is a global constraint to agricultural production. Spinosad is a new, low-environmental-risk insecticide that primarily targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and is effective against a wide range of pest species. However, after only a few years of application, field evolved resistance emerged in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, an important pest of brassica crops worldwide. Spinosad resistance in a Hawaiian population results from a single incompletely recessive and autosomal gene, and here we use AFLP linkage mapping to identify the chromosome controlling resistance in a backcross family. Recombinational mapping with more than 700 backcross progeny positioned a putative spinosad target, nAChR alpha 6 (Px6), at the resistance locus, PxSpinR. A mutation within the ninth intron splice junction of Px6 results in mis-splicing of transcripts, which produce a predicted protein truncated between the third and fourth transmembrane domains. Additional resistance-associated Px6 transcripts that excluded the mutation containing exon were detected, and these were also predicted to produce truncated proteins. Identification of the locus of resistance in this important crop pest will facilitate field monitoring of the spread of resistance and offer insights into the genetic basis of spinosad resistance in other species.

TI  - Quantitative food webs of lepidopteran leafminers and their parasitoids in a Japanese deciduous forest
AB  - Quantitative food webs were constructed to explore the community structure of leaf-mining moths in the family Gracillariidae and their parasitoid wasps in a deciduous forest in Hokkaido, Japan. A whole food web was constructed from data collected from June to October 2001. In the web, 16 leafminer species on seven tree species were attacked by 58 species of hymenopteran parasitoid; 376 links between leafminers and parasitoids were observed. Leafminers were specialist herbivores, but most parasitoids were generalists. Five webs were constructed for the seasonal prevalence of leafminers over the one-year period to reveal the temporal dynamics in community structure. Among the seasonal webs, the first web in June was distinctive because two tree species, Japanese umbrella tree Magnolia obovata and Japanese magnolia M. kobus, supported the community. Second to fourth webs from July to September were dominated by the leafminer species on Japanese oak Quercus crispula, and the fifth web was marked by that on Carpinus cordata. The extent of potential apparent competition among leafminers was evaluated using quantitative parasitoid overlap diagrams. These diagrams suggested that abundant host species are likely to have large indirect effects on less abundant species. Moreover, the potential for apparent competition between leafminer species inhabiting different host tree species can occur, although leafminers sharing the same tree species are prone to interact via shared parasitoids. In this system, particular leafminer species, acting as potential sources of apparent competition, can affect other species as sinks, and control whole-community dynamics. Directed apparent competition may potentially occur around oak trees.

TI  - Evaluation of action thresholds for chronic rice insect pests in the Philippines. III. Leaffolders
AB  - Action thresholds (AT) as insecticide application decision tools were developed and tested against rice leaffolders Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guene) and Marasmia patnalis Bradley (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in four sites and 68 crops over a 13-year period in the Philippines. Leaffolder damage levels were generally low with a mean over all sites and crops of 2 3% damaged leaves (DL) and 6 9% in a given site as a per-crop average based on weekly samplings, with highest incidence per field on a given sampling date of 48%DL. The damage incidence over a typical crop cycle formed a bell-shaped curve with maximum numbers in the late reproductive and early ripening stages. Continuous population buildup over the planting cycle did not occur in any one site over the season, thus a strategy of monitoring earlier planted fields to forewarn against impending economic damage had no basis. ATs were based on different levels of percentage DL, number of larvae per hill (L), and density of flushed moths. Collectively ATs were surpassed in 1, 12, and 4% of fields in each of the three main growth stages. A scoring system was based on benchmark criteria including both leaffolder damage and yield loss. The 15%DL threshold performed best in all growth stages, only equaled by 1L in the vegetative stage, scoring 93 99% correct decisions in each of the growth stages. Flushed moths produced the most false positive decisions and the lowest performance scores. The best insecticide response gave only a disappointing 53% control and therefore was a significant weakness in using AT technology. BPMC, endosulfan, and monocrotophos performed the best and azinphos-ethyl and Bt the least. Sites with the highest densities had the most rapid rise in damage levels, thus requiring more frequent monitoring. Low leaffolder damage levels were most likely due to the activity of natural enemies. Given the ability of high tillering varieties to compensate from pest damage, farmers would be better off embracing integrated crop management as a preventative measure to bolster inherent tolerance levels combined with crop monitoring based on historical population levels. In sites with a record of high damage levels, monitoring should start 4 weeks after transplanting (WT) on a weekly basis and more risk averse farmers may increase the interval to twice a week during flag leaf stage. In sites with lower observed levels, monitoring can begin 6 WT on a weekly basis and continue through the flag leaf stage. Significant yield increases were recorded with the best AT characters despite evidence of modern rices to tolerate high damage levels. Reasons for this apparent paradox are discussed.

TI  - Modeling population dynamics of a tea pest with temperature-dependent development predicting emergence timing and potential damage
AB  - The tea leaf roller, Caloptilia theivora Walsingham (Lepidoptera Gracillariinae), is one of the serious pests of tea plants in Japan. To understand the mechanism of seasonal occurrence of this insect pest, we developed a population dynamics model that explicitly incorporates the temperature-dependent development of the pest. The model predictions were compared with observed captures in pheromone traps at the experimental site of the Kagoshima Tea Experiment Research Station in Japan. The results showed that the emergence timing of the insect pest observed in the field was determined primarily by temperature. The relationship between the timing of adult emergence and the leaf damage level was also studied using a logistic regression model. The infestation level decreased as the interval between the adult peak emergence date and the date of tea plucking increased, implying that asynchrony between plant phenology and emergence of the insect pest is a critical factor reducing damage level. We examined how the damage level changes according to global warming. Increased temperature made the timing of insect appearance forward and enhance asynchrony of plantpest phenology. Therefore, reduction of damage level by the insect pest is expected under global warming.

TI  - Fruit maturity and soundness relevant to feeding choice by fruit-piercing moths (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in citrus crops in northeast Australia
AB  - Fruit-piercing moths are significant pests of a range of fruit crops throughout much of the world's tropics and subtropics. Feeding damage by the adult moths is most widely reported in varieties of citrus. In the years 2003 and 2004, fruit-piercing moth activity was observed regularly at night in citrus crops in northeast Australia, to determine the level of maturity (based on rind colour) and soundness of fruit attacked. 'Navelina' navel and 'Washington' navel orange, grapefruit and mixed citrus crops were assessed, and fruit was rated and placed into five categories green, colouring, ripe, overripe and damaged. There were no statistical differences in the percentage of fruit attacked in each category across crops. However, within the individual crops significant proportions of green 'Navelina' fruit (58.7%) and green mixed citrus (57.1%) were attacked in 2004. Among all the crops assessed, 25.1% of moth feeding occurred on overripe or damaged fruit. Crops started to be attacked at least 8 weeks before picking, but in two crops there were large influxes of moths (reaching 27 and 35 moths/100 trees, respectively) immediately before harvest. Moth activity was most intense between late February and late March. Eudocima fullonia (Clerck) represented 79.1% of all moths recorded on fruit, with Eudocima materna (L.), Eudocima salaminia (Cramer) and Serrodes campana (Guen.) the only other species observed capable of inflicting primary damage. Our results suggest that growers should monitor moth activity from 8 weeks before harvest and consider remedial action if moth numbers increase substantially as the crop matures or there is a history of moth problems. The number of fruit pickings could be increased to progressively remove ripe fruit or early harvest of the entire crop contemplated if late influxes of moths are known.

TI  - Yield loss quantification and assessment of economic injury level for the anthophagous generation of the European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana Den. et Schiff. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - Until now, no attempts have been made to assess systematically the damage to vine from the first (anthophagous) generation of the European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana Den. et Schiff. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae). No standards for intervention have been established; consequently, control measures are undertaken arbitrarily and regardless of economic costs. In the region of East Attiki in Greece, where the wine variety Savvatiano is grown, the larvae of the first generation of the moth may destroy not only blossoms, but also newly set berries. Damage simulation experiments, carried out in this area to study the variety's response to injury of blossoms and berries, showed that it has the capacity to compensate completely for the damage to the blossoms by means of a proportionate decrease in shedding of natural blossoms. However, it cannot make up for damage to young berries. The yield loss from the first generation larvae was calculated over the years 1995 1999 and economic injury levels (EILs) were assessed The loss of yield, in this case exclusively from injury to berries, was found to be, on average, 15.5&ThickSpace;g/grape, 75.5&ThickSpace;kg/ha or 3.6%. The EIL, measured in units of injury and numbers of pest specimens using simple empirical equations incorporating dynamic biological and economic factors, fluctuated only slightly during the 5 years of the survey, averaging 7.7 larval nests/inflorescence or 3.6 larvae/inflorescence. Although the EIL is specific to the Savvatiano variety and the East Attiki region, the methodology employed could have a broader application.

TI  - Diversity of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera Geometridae) along an Afrotropical elevational rainforest transect
AB  - Geometrid moths were investigated at 26 sites on 9 elevational levels along an elevational transect at Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), stretching from the fine-grained mosaic of small agroforest plots with combined cultivation of trees, shrubs and crops at 1650m through mountain rainforest to heathland at 3300m. We sampled moths manually at light between 1900 and 2200 in the rainy seasons of March to May and October to January in the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. Along the transect, the composition of moth communities changed from a domination by Sterrhinae and Ennominae to a dominance of Larentiinae with increasing elevation. Overall, alpha diversity was very low compared to other tropical mountain regions. Fisher's alpha showed a maximum of 30 in the agroforest mosaic at 1650m and decreased to values around 12 in the mountain rainforest. Communities of geometrid moths within the forest belt were significantly dissimilar from communities outside the forest. The diversity patterns on Mt. Kilimanjaro can be related to the young age, island-like position and history of the mountain. These factors have led to the formation of a homogeneous upper mountain rainforest habitat which in turn houses homogeneous moth communities with a low diversity compared to habitats at lower elevations. Here, a heterogeneous habitat mosaic allowing the intrusion of savannah species into this former forest habitat may account for an increased diversity. In the heath zone above the forest, climatic conditions are very harsh, permitting only few specialists to thrive in this ericaceous woodland. Edge effects were discernible at the forestheathland boundary where some moth species from heathland invaded the closed forest. At the boundary between agroforest and a forest mosaic of exotic Acacia and Eucalyptus forest plantations and natural mountain forest, diversity values remained low as the dominant species Chiasmia fuscataria accounted for far higher proportions than other dominant species in any of the other habitats.

TI  - Larval parasitism by native insects on the introduced stem-galling mothEpiblema strenuanaWalker (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) and its implications for biological control ofParthenium hysterophorus(Asteraceae)
AB  - The significance of natural enemies in the failure or reduced effectiveness of weed biological control agents remains largely unknown. Larval and pupal parasitism by native insects in the stem-galling mothEpiblema strenuanawas studied in north Queensland, 4 (198687) and 16 (199899) years after its introduction as a biological-control agent forParthenium hysterophorus. Specific questions answered in this study are (i) Has parasitism increased over the years?; (ii) Are the levels of parasitism influenced by the host plant phenology?; and (iii) What are the potential implications of current parasitism levels for the effectiveness ofE. strenuana? There was no increase in the parasitoid species assemblage over the years. In 198687,Antrocephalussp. andBraconsp. were the most predominant species. The combined larval and pupal parasitism was low (2.6%) and there was no seasonal difference in the parasitism levels. In 199899Braconsp. was the most prevalent species. Parasitism byBraconsp. in 199899 was several times higher (22.9%) than the combined larval and pupal parasitism in 198687. However, parasitism byBraconsp. remained low (6.58.2%) at the beginning of the parthenium-growing season, and reached peak levels (4953%) only at the end of the season. Parasitism byBraconsp. was also significantly lower in rosettes (7.2%) than in flowering plants (22.8%). Galling can have a negative impact on the weed only when initiated at the rosette stage. In 199899 lower levels of parasitism early in the season when most plants are in the rosette stage suggest that the impact of parasitism on the effectiveness of the gall insect may not be significant.

TI  - Factors favouring the development and maintenance of outbreaks in an invasive leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) a life table study
AB  - 1 Life tables were constructed for seven generations of the invasive horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella in Switzerland, to assess the factors allowing the moth to build and maintain outbreak densities and to identify gaps among their mortality factors that could be targeted by new control methods. The fecundity of females was calculated and the mortality factors affecting all developmental stages determined. 2 Females contained 106.6 eggs. In captivity, the mean number of eggs laid per female varied between 34 and 82 eggs, with a maximum of 184 eggs. Egg mortality was 1875% and was mostly due to unknown factors. 3 The main mortality factors affecting larvae and pupae in the leaves were predation by birds and arthropods in all generation and leaf senescence in the autumn generation. Parasitoids killed less than 5% of the population. 4 Nearly 90% of overwintering pupae died in dead leaves, the majority of them being killed by earthworms and other leaf decomposers. As a result, the overwintering generations were the only ones showing a net rate of increase less than one. Non-overwintering generations had net rates of increase between four and 11, allowing populations to build up from spring to autumn. 5 The persistence of high outbreak densities in Europe is explained by a combination of at least three factors (i) high fecundity; (ii) multivoltinism; (iii) the unusually low impact of traditional natural enemies of leaf miners and particularly parasitoids. 6 Yearly variations in population densities could be at least partly explained by differences in larval mortality due to leaf senescence and intraspecific competition in the last generation in autumn.

TI  - Taphonomic variations in Eocene fish-bearing varves at Horsefly, British Columbia, reveal 10 000 years of environmental change
AB  - The Eocene Horsefly locality in British Columbia has yielded many fossil fishes, insects, and plants. Its varved sediments make it ideal for study of temporal changes in environment and fish morphology. Several intervals of diatomaceous varves indicate a deep, stratified lake setting. Earlier studies focused on morphological and taphonomic change during the 700-year H2 interval and morphological change during the 10 000-year H3 interval. The present study uses taphonomy as an index for environmental change during the ten millennia represented by H3, comparing taphonomic changes with the morphologic changes found earlier. The H3 interval records deposition in deep water, indicated by dominance of the fish genera Amyzon and Eohiodon. Quiet water conditions are indicated by minimal fin disarticulation. Hypoxia at the time of fish death is confirmed by open mouths of most fish specimens, while cool water on the lake floor prevented full flotation of fish carcasses. Water depth, temperature, and oxygenation fluctuated during H3 deposition. Periods of cooler, deeper, more hypoxic water are indicated by greater numbers and size of Amyzon specimens and by less disarticulation of skull and abdominal bones. Periods of warmer, shallower, more oxygenated waters are indicated by more disarticulation, less fin tetany, smaller fish specimens, and greater diversity of species. Correlations between the taphonomic changes and morphological changes in A. aggregatum are weak. Therefore, the morphological changes are not easily explained as ecophenotypic or short-term evolutionary responses to changes in physical lake conditions. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] La localit de Horsefly (ocne) en Colombie-Britannique a produit plusieurs poissons, insectes et plantes fossiles. Ses sdiments varvs la rendent idale pour l'tude des changements temporels de morphologie des poissons et de l'environnement. Plusieurs intervalles de varves diatomes indiquent un environnement de lac stratifi profond. Des tudes antrieures ciblaient les changements morphologiques et taphonomiques durant l'intervalle H2 de 700 ans et les changements morphologiques durant l'intervalle H3 de 10 000 ans. La prsente tude utilise la taphonomie en tant qu'index pour les changements environnementaux durant les dix millnaires reprsents par H3, comparant les changements taphonomiques et les changements morphologiques trouvs antrieurement. L'intervalle H3 enregistre la dposition en eau profonde, indique par la dominance des genres de poissons Amyzon et Eohiodon. Des conditions d'eaux tranquilles sont indiques par une dsarticulation minimale des nageoires. L'hypoxie au moment de la mort du poisson est confirme par la bouche ouverte de la plupart des spcimens de poissons, alors que l'eau froide au fond du lac empchait la flottation totale des carcasses des poissons. La profondeur, la temprature et l'oxygnation de l'eau fluctuaient durant la dposition de H3. Des priodes d'eau plus froide, plus profonde et plus hypoxique sont indiques par le plus grand nombre et la taille accrue des spcimens Amyzon et par la dsarticulation moindre des os du crne et de l'abdomen. Des priodes d'eau plus chaude, moins profondes et plus oxygnes sont indiques par plus de dsarticulation, moins de ttanie des nageoires, des spcimens de poissions plus petits et une plus grande diversit des espces. Les corrlations entre les changements taphonomiques et les changements morphologiques chez A. aggregatum sont faibles. Les changements morphologiques ne sont donc pas aussi facilement explicables que les rponses cophnotypiques ou celles court terme aux changements physiques des conditions du lac.[Traduit par la Rdaction] (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences is the property of Canadian Science Publishing and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

TI  - TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF LEPIDOPTERA COLLECTED IN AN EUCALYPTUS PLANTATION IN THE STATE OF GOIS, BRAZIL
AB  - Lepidopterans are considered an important group of Eucalyptus pests in Brazil due to severe losses in wood production arising from defoliation. Biweekly collections were made in the State of Gois, Brazil as part of a study of the population dynamics and the effects of temperature and rainfall on Lepidoptera pests of Eucalyptus. Lepidoptera were collected with five light traps installed at two meters high with black light and powered by a 12 volt battery. These insects were divided into groups according to their importance as pests of Eucalyptus group 1 11 primary pests; group 2 10 secondary pests; group 3 64 species without defined importance to Eucalyptus ; and group 4 non-identified species. Among the primary pests, Thyrinteina arnobia (Geometridae), Eupseudosoma aberrans (Arctiidae) and Sarsina violascens (Lymantriidae) were the most frequent, the last two being constant (> 50% of collections) and the first one accessory (25-50%). Idalus admirabilis (Arctiidae) and Eacles imperialis magnifica (Saturniidae) were the most frequent secondary pests, the first being constant and the second accessory. Most of the Lepidoptera species were collected during the coldest and driest months, which indicates that these conditions could favour the occurrence of Lepidoptera outbreaks in plantations of Eucalyptus in this region of Brazil. For this reason, population monitoring of these species should be intensified during these periods.

TI  - Evolution of a triplet repeat in a conifer
AB  - The opportunity to trace the evolution of a triplet repeat is rare, especially for seed-plant lineages with a well-defined fossil record. Microsatellite PtTX2133 sequences from 18 species in 2 conifer genera were used to calibrate the birth of a CAGn repeat, from its protomicrosatellite origins to its repeat expansion. Birth occurred in the hard-pine genome ~ 136 million years ago, or 14 million generations ago, then expanded as a polymorphic triplet repeat 136-100 million years before a major North American vicariance event. Calibration of the triplet-repeat birth and expansion is supported by the shared allelic lineages among Old and New World hard pines and the shared alleles solely among North American diploxylon or hard pines. Five CAGn repeat units appeared to be the expansion threshold for Old and New World diploxylon pines. Haploxylon pine species worldwide did not undergo birth and repeat expansion, remaining monomorphic, with a single imperfect 198-bp allele. A sister genus, Picea, had only a region of cryptic simplicity, preceding a proto-microsatellite region. The polymorphic triplet repeat in hard pines is older than some long-lived microsatellites reported for reptiles, yet younger than those reported for insects. Some cautionary points are raised about phylogenetic applications for this long-lived microsatellite.Key words gymnosperms, microsatellite evolution, cladogenesis, phylogenetic analysis.

Le microsatellite tait dj prsent dans le gnome des pins durs il y a ~136 millions d'annes, soit environ 14 millions de gnrations. Il a ensuite subi une expansion pour former une rptition trinuclotidique polymorphe entre 136 et 100 millions d'annes, avant un vnement majeur de vicariance en Amrique du Nord. La dtermination de la naissance et de l'expansion du microsatellite trinuclotidique est supporte par (i) le partage de lignages allliques entre les pins durs des Vieux et Nouveau Mondes, ainsi que (ii) la prsence d'allles uniquement parmi les pins diploxylons ou durs d'Amrique du Nord. La naissance et l'expansion du microsatellite ne se sont pas produites chez les pins haploxylons travers le monde, le locus demeurant monomorphe avec un seul allle de 198 pb. Chez les Picea, un genre proche, on trouve une rgion simplicit cryptique qui prcde un proto-microsatellite. Le microsatellite trinuclotidique polymorphe chez les pins durs est plus ancien que certains des microsatellites les plus vieux chez les reptiles, mais pourtant plus jeune que ceux rapports chez les insectes.

TI  - Species composition and life histories of shelter-building caterpillars on Salix miyabeana
AB  - We studied the species composition and life history patterns of shelter-building microlepidoptera on the willow Salix miyabeana in Hokkaido, northern Japan. We identified 23 microlepidopteran species across seven families that constructed leaf shelters. Species in Tortricidae and Pyralidae comprised approximately 90% of the total number of sampled shelter-building microlepidoptera that reached adult eclosion in the laboratory. Seasonal changes in the density of leaf shelters showed two peaks early June and mid-August. In June, caterpillars of Gypsonoma bifasciata, Gypsonoma ephoropa, Acleris issikii and Saliciphage acharis were the principal shelter builders, while in August shelters were constructed primarily by caterpillars of Nephopterix adelphella, A. issikii and S. acharis. Approximately 90% of leaf shelters were constructed on the top portions of shoots, suggesting that most shelter-building caterpillars prefer to build leaf shelters here.

TI  - Pollen fates and the limits on male reproductive success in an orchid population
AB  - Male reproductive success in higher plants depends largely on the fates of pollen, but current methodologies have given only partial insights into this important aspect of plant mating. We present a detailed analysis of the proportions and absolute amounts of stained pollen involved in six key fates for the hawkmoth-pollinated African orchid Disa cooperi. Despite being packaged into pollinaria, high proportions (> 0.95) of the pollen removed from anthers were lost during transport by hawkmoths in both years. The proportion of pollen lost correlated positively with the number of pollinaria removed from a plant, so that pollen export did not vary with pollen removal. Most pollen was dispersed to neighbouring plants, with rare long-distance dispersal up to 65 m. Of the pollen that reached stigmas during both years, roughly equal amounts were involved in facilitated self-pollination vs. cross-pollination, but the relative proportions of these fates differed between years. Contrary to expectation, we found that self-pollination between flowers did not increase with the number of open flowers, even though moths probed significantly more flowers on larger plants. However, during both years the fraction of removed pollen exported to other plants declined significantly with increasing self-pollination on the source plant, indicating that once self-pollination occurred it reduced (discounted) subsequent pollen export opportunities. The packaging of pollen into pollinaria in orchids appears to increase overall transfer efficiency by at least an order of magnitude relative to plants with granular pollen. Nevertheless, considerable uncertainties remain in the male reproductive success of individual orchids. 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 86, 175190.

TI  - Predispersal seed predation and population dynamics in the perennial understorey herb Actaea spicata
AB  - Predispersal seed predation by a moth larva, Eupithecia immundata Leinig & Zeller (Geometridae), and its impact on population dynamics of the perennial herb Actaea spicata L. were studied during 7 years in deciduous and mixed coniferous forest populations in southeastern Sweden. Twelve population matrix models were constructed based on transition probabilities among six stage classes in the populations. The fraction of seeds consumed varied between 21% and 80% but was not significantly correlated with seed production. Experimental seed addition compensating for seed losses caused by the seed predator resulted in increased seedling emergence in one of the populations. Population growth rate was positive ( > 1) in 1 of 6 years in the deciduous forest population and in 2 of 6 years in the mixed coniferous forest population. Survival among reproductive individuals contributed most strongly to in both populations. In some years, the projected changed from positive to negative values because of seed loss caused by E. immundata. However, results suggest that seed predation did not affect to any large extent, despite a considerable seed predation. This study is one of the rare efforts to estimate the impact of seed predation on population dynamics of perennial plants.

TI  - Spider fauna of soybean crops in south-east Queensland and their potential as predators of Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - Spiders are among the most abundant predators recorded in grain crops in Australia. They are voracious predators, and combined with their high abundance, may play an important role in the reduction of pest populations. The significance of spider assemblages as biological control agents of key pests such as Helicoverpa spp. in Australian agroecosystems is largely unknown. A thorough inventory was made of the spider fauna inhabiting unsprayed soybean fields at Gatton, south-east Queensland. One-hundred-and-two morphospecies from 28 families were collected using vacuum sampling and pitfall traps across two summer seasons (200001, 200102). No-choice feeding tests in the laboratory, using eggs and larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) as prey, were used to ascertain the predatory potential of each spider group. The field-collected spider assemblage ate on average 2.4 (0.7 standard error) to 5.0 (0.8) eggs per 24 h per spider (1025% of those available), depending on level of starvation. Clubionidae were the only spiders to readily consume eggs in the laboratory (mean of 18.4 1.5 eggs per starved spider and 8.2 3.9 per non-starved spider after 24 h). Starved spiders consumed 9.4 ( 0.1) first-instar larvae per 24 h per spider (90% of those available). This information was combined with field observations and literature from Australian and overseas studies to assess the potential of spider groups as predators of Helicoverpa spp. Lycosidae, Clubionidae, Oxyopidae, Salticidae and Thomisidae have the capacity to contribute to control of Helicoverpa spp. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Australian Journal of Entomology is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

TI  - Dry season survival, diapause duration and timing of diapause termination in the millet stem borer, Coniesta ignefusalis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in Northern Ghana
AB  - Studies were conducted between 1996 and 1997 in Northern Ghana on the dry season survival tactics of the millet stem borer Coniesta ignefusalis (Hampson). Results confirmed that the main survival tactic employed by the insect was larval diapause, which lasts from November to May the following year. In both years, diapause termination occurred in the field 4-6 weeks after the resumption of the rains, depending on the year and location. Larval mortality rate was high during diapause with peaks occurring towards the end of the dry season in May. During the 2 years, larval populations declined by at least 50% between the start of diapause and its termination. No parasitoids were encountered during the study period, suggesting that biocontrol agents are probably not very important in the population dynamics of the insect. The implications of these findings for management of the pest are discussed.

TI  - The history and control of the pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea (D. & S.) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), in Scotland from 1976 to 2000
AB  - Abstract 1 The pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea, has been a serious pest of lodgepole pine plantations in Scotland since 1976. It historically feeds on native Scots pine throughout Europe but population levels of P. flammea on this host have never been high enough to cause tree mortality in the U.K. 2 This paper reviews recent advances in the biology of the pest and documents control programmes from 1976 to 1999. 3 There has been practically uninterrupted population monitoring of P. flammea from 1977 to the present day in Scottish lodgepole pine plantations. Intervention with chemical spraying has often been necessary. 4 The population data suggest that populations of P. flammea may have had a cyclic pattern over the monitoring period, with outbreaks occurring at regular intervals of between 6 and 7 years. 5 The amplitude of population cycles was large during the 1970s and 1980s, but has dampened in recent years. Natural enemies are believed to contribute to this trend. Fungal disease, specifically, appears to have had a greater effect on pest populations in recent years than in the past and is suggested to have contributed significantly to the population dynamics observed since 1990.

TI  - Control of Ichneumonoptera chrysophanes (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) by mating disruption in persimmons
AB  - Abstract A ca 0.62 ha block of 480 persimmon trees at Woombye, Queensland, was treated with the pheromone of Ichneumonoptera chrysophanes emitted from polyethylene dispensers placed at a rate equivalent to 1480/ha early in September 2000. A second block of 219 trees was left untreated and served as the control. The technique was assessed using traps to measure the ability of I. chrysophanes males to locate synthetic pheromone baits, and by the incidence of fresh damage detected during December and June surveys of a minimum of 67 trees in each block. Pheromone release rates were determined approximately weekly by measuring the amount of pheromone remaining in a sample of 10 dispensers suspended within the treated block. A second orchard at Amamoor, Queensland, was partly treated with pheromone applied at a similar rate, but was monitored only in terms of trap catch. No assessments were made of damage levels. Mean pheromone-release rates ranged from 15.8 to 1.6 mg/ha/h. Over the entire period of the trial, from 8 September 2000 to 27 June 2001, no males were caught in any of the 12 traps in the pheromone-treated block of the Woombye orchard, while 944 were caught in the five traps in the untreated block. The proportion of trees with fresh damage was significantly higher in the untreated block (0.188 and 0.567; December and June surveys, respectively) than in the treated block (0.027 and 0.205), although there was no significant difference between treatments in the mean number of strikes/infested tree in either survey. In the Amamoor orchard no moths were caught in any of the 32 traps in the treated blocks, compared with a total of 303 in the 13 traps in the untreated block.

TI  - Impact of nitrogenous-fertilization on the population dynamics and natural control of rice leaffolders (Lep. Pyralidae)
AB  - The effect of nitrogenous-fertilization on the population dynamics and natural control of rice leaffolders was studied in an irrigated rice area in the Philippines. Nitrogen was applied at three levels (0, 75 and 150 kg N ha[sup -1]), and its impact on crop growth and yield, arthropod abundance, and rates of leaffolder parasitism and survival was assessed with weekly samples. Rice plants were taller and had a higher leaf nitrogen content with increasing levels of nitrogenous fertilization, but grain yield was highest at the medium nitrogen level. Herbivores, predators, and parasitoids increased in abundance with nitrogenous-fertilization level. The average density of rice leaffolder larvae at the highest nitrogen level was eight times the density at zero nitrogen level, and the peak percentage injured leaves increased from 5 to 35%. The strong increase in larval density was due to the positive effect of nitrogenous-fertilization on egg recruitment and survival of medium-sized larvae. The percentage parasitism of eggs and larvae was not affected by nitrogenous-fertilization. The increase in survival of medium-sized larvae with nitrogen levels was associated with lower predator to leaffolder ratios. The strong effect of nitrogenous-fertilization in the present small-scale experiment was attributed mainly to allowing the moths an oviposition choice between plots with different application levels of nitrogen. Therefore it is hypothesized that the effect of increasing nitrogenous-fertilization level on leaffolder larval densities will be less pronounced when implemented over a large area.

TI  - Seasonal patterns of activity in geometrid moths (Lepidoptera Geometridae) from a lowland and highland eucalypt forest in Tasmania
AB  - Activity patterns of geometrid moths were compared in two areas, one in wet eucalypt forest at high altitude and the other in mainly dry forest at low altitude in Tasmania. One hundred and twenty-six species were able to be grouped into six distinct groups (i.e. spring, spring and summer, summer, autumn, autumn and winter, all year) in terms of their patterns of seasonal occurrence. Three of the 16 species common to the two sites differed in their seasonality of occurrence, with their length of occurrence being extended at Old Chum Dam compared with Central Plateau. Moth numbers strongly reflected monthly changes in minimum temperature, with moth activity being greater at the high altitude site than at the low altitude site for an equivalent temperature. However, a given change in minimum temperature led to an equivalent change in the magnitude of moth numbers at both sites. These seasonal patterns of occurrence must be considered in the planning of biodiversity surveys.

TI  - Activity of fruit-piercing moths, Eudocima spp. (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), in north Queensland crops Some effects of fruit type, locality and season
AB  - Fruit-piercing moth activity was assessed in lychee or carambola crops on the wet tropical coast and on the dry tropical tablelands of north-eastern Queensland between 1985 and 1993. Monitoring occurred at fruiting, from 30 min after sundown for 1 h by systematically inspecting orchard trees under torchlight. Six species were recorded Eudocima fullonia (Clerck), Eudocima jordani (Holland), Eudocima materna (L.), Eudocima salaminia (Cramer), Eudocima aurantia (Moore) and Eudocima cocalus (Cramer). Moths were detected between November and August, with activity lowest during the driest months (JulyOctober) when fruit availability also decreased. Most annual variation in moth numbers occurred at the beginning of the wet season (NovemberDecember) when lychees cropped. The principal species recorded at all three sites on both fruit types between November and mid-March was E. fullonia. It represented 95.5% of the moths on coastal lychees. During autumn, the major species in carambola crops were E. jordani on the coast and E. materna on the tablelands (where total activity was only about half that in the coastal crop). Over all sampling years, 77.9% of all moths caught on coastal fruit were males, compared to 51.4% on tableland fruit. Of the female moths dissected from all sites, 77.7% contained spermatophores and fully developed eggs. An assessment of moth activity through a single night (19.0005.00 h) in coastal carambolas showed that 72.9% of all moths arrived before midnight. The results indicate that there are opportunities in tableland areas for fruit production during the dry season without the need for control measures.

TI  - Mate-finding allee effect in spruce budworm population dynamics
AB  - Allee effects can cause populations to decline due to decreasing population growth rates with decreasing density and play a major role in population dynamics. Mate-finding failure, a common mechanism contributing to demographic Allee effects, is usually difficult to demonstrate because of the arduous nature of sampling individuals at very low densities. In a rising outbreak of the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana ( Clemens) ( Lepidoptera Tortricidae), we used caged and tethered virgin females in traps to measure mating success over population densities ranging from deep endemic to outbreak conditions. We found that mating success increased with increasing population density, and that at endemic population densities, females experienced difficulties attracting males and mating, demonstrating for the first time a mate-finding Allee effect in the spruce budworm. The relationship between population density and mating success is nonlinear. As population density increased, the proportion of mated females eventually reached a plateau and mating success was not 100% even at the highest moth densities, probably due to female reluctance to mate and perhaps interference competition by males for access to females. Both laboratory-reared and wild females were equally effective in synthesizing pheromone, attracting males, and mating. Our results strongly suggest that a mate-finding Allee effect is involved in maintaining low-density spruce budworm populations below an Allee threshold where they fail to grow. Factors such as changes in predation pressure and immigration could help populations overcome this Allee threshold.

TI  - Effects of climate and density-dependent factors on population dynamics of the pine processionary moth in the Southern Alps
AB  - Forest pest populations can fluctuate dramatically in relation to climate and density-dependent factors. Although the distributional range of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera Notodontidae) appears to be expanding northward and upslope with climate warming, the relative importance of climate and endogenous, density-dependent factors has not been clearly documented. We analyzed the population dynamics of the moth using long-term data from two provinces in the Southern Alps (Trento 19902009, Bolzano/Bozen 19752011) to evaluate the relative importance of climate and density-dependent factors as regional drivers. Both summer temperatures and rainfall significantly affected population growth rate, with different outcomes depending on the local conditions. Although previous studies indicated that low winter temperatures have negative effects on insect performance, our analyses did not show any negative effect on the population dynamics. A negative density dependent feedback with a 1-year lag emerged as the most important factor driving the population dynamics in both regions. Potential mechanisms explaining the observed negative density feedback include deterioration of host quality, increased mortality caused by pathogens, and increase of prolonged diapause as an adaptive mechanism to escape adverse conditions.

TI  - Forest moth assemblages as indicators of biodiversity and environmental quality in a temperate deciduous forest
AB  - The aim of the present study was to find groups of moths suitable for estimating changes in the abundance and richness of local and regional biodiversity in a temperate forest. We captured macro-moths from May to October over a 5-year period (2005-2009) at various sites in Mt. Jirisan National Park (JNP) in southern Korea. Six taxa were selected based on a strong correlation between the number of species in these taxa and total number of species of large moths Ennominae (Enn), Arctiinae (Arc), Hermininae (Her), Notodontidae (Not), Drepanidae (Dre) and Ophiderinae (Oph). Of these, combinations of four groups were found to have the best predictive capability. We determined whether these indicator groups could be used to reveal mean differences in species abundance according to spatial (forest type, altitude) and temporal variables (monsoon season) since moth composition and abundances were closely related with these variables. The mean differences in the groups of moths in the two types of forest (Arc, Dre, Enn, Not), two altitudes (Dre, Enn, Her, Oph) and two seasons (Dre, Enn, Oph) were significant. Overall, it was revealed that a set of four groups, including two taxa (Dre and Enn), could be used to show differences in local and regional biodiversity of moths in southern Korean temperate forest.

TI  - ATTRACTION OF A NATIVE FLORIDA LEAFMINER, PHYLLOCNISTIS INSIGNIS (LEPIDOPTERA GRACILLARIIDAE), TO PHEROMONE OF AN INVASIVE CITRUS LEAFMINER, P. CITRELLA EVIDENCE FOR MATING DISRUPTION OF A NATIVE NON-TARGET SPECIES
AB  - We collected a native North American species, Phyllocnistis insignis (Frey & Boll) (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), in traps baited with a 31 blend of (Z,Z,E)-7,11,13-hexadecatrienal (triene) and (Z,Z)-7,11-hexadecadienal (diene), 2 components of the sex pheromone of the invasive citrus leafminer, P. citrella Stainton. No moths were caught in unbaited traps during 6 months of monitoring. We evaluated seasonal abundance of P. insignis by monitoring traps in citrus (Citrus spp.; Sapindales Rutaceae) groves at 4 sites in southeastern Florida during 2012. Phyllocnistis insignis moths were found in pheromone-baited traps year round with a peak flight in May. In trials designed to evaluate mating disruption of P. citrella, application of triene (SPLAT CLM) disrupted trap catch of P. insignis during a 9 week period following treatment in spring (825 mg triene/ha), but not winter (750 mg triene/ha). In a second experiment, application of triene (837 mg/ha) and a 31 blend of triene and diene (840 mg triene + 280 mg diene/ha, respectively) loaded onto rubber dispensers disrupted catch of male P. insignis during a 12 week period following treatment of 0.14 ha plots. Also, application of a 31 blend of triene and diene (764 mg + 253 mg/ha, respectively) formulated in SPLAT CLM disrupted trap catch of male P. insignis during a 4 week period following treatment in a 66 ha plot. In a third experiment, application of blend (837 mg triene + 278 mg diene/ha) reduced the incidence of trap catch to zero during a 16 week period following treatment of 0.87 ha plots. These data suggest that efforts to disrupt mating of P. citrella influence non-target populations of the congeneric leafminer species, P. insignis. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Se obtuvieron especmenes de una especie nativa norteamericana, Phyllocnistis insignis (Frey y Boll), en trampas cebadas con una mezcla 31 de (Z,Z,E) -7,11,13-hexadecatrienal (trieno) y (Z,Z) 7,11-hexadecadienal (dieno), dos componentes de la feromona sexual de la minador de los ctricos invasiva, P. citrella Stainton. Ninguna polilla fue capturada en trampas sin cebo durante los seis meses de seguimiento. Se evalu la abundancia estacional de P. insignis mediante el monitoreo de captura en trampas ubicadas en plantaciones de ctricos (Citrus spp.; Sapindales Rutaceae) en cinco sitios en el sureste de Florida en 2012. Polillas de P. insignis se encontraron en trampas cebadas con feromonas durante todo el ao con un vuelo mximo en mayo. En los ensayos diseados para evaluar la confusin sexual de P. citrella, la aplicacin del trieno (SPLAT CLM) redujo captura de P. insignis durante un perodo de 9 semanas despus del tratamiento en la primavera (825 mg trieno/ha), pero no en el invierno (750 mg trieno/ha). En un segundo experimento, aplicacin de trieno (837 mg/ ha) y de una mezcla 31 de trieno y dieno (840 mg + 280 trieno dieno mg/ha, respectivamente) en dispensadores de goma redujo captura de machos de P. insignis durante un tratamiento de 12 semanas en parcelas de 0,14 ha. Adems, la aplicacin de una mezcla 31 de trieno y dieno (764 + 253 mg/ha, respectivamente) formulada en CLM SPLAT redujo captura de machos de P. insignis durante un periodo de 4 semanas despus en una parcela de 66 ha.

TI  - Mating-Disruption Trials for Control of Mediterranean Flour Moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera Pyralidae), in Traditional Flour Mills
AB  - In the present work, 3 years of field trials (from 2007 to 2009) were carried out to evaluate use of the pheromone (9Z,12)-tetradecadienyl acetate (TDA) for mating disruption (MD) of the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller. Dispensers containing the pheromone TDA were placed in two traditional flour mills. Pheromone-baited funnel traps were used to monitor the population fluctuations of E. kuehniella males throughout the entire experimental period; female oviposition was assessed by placement of petri cups containing wheat germ-semolina flour bait. According to our results, the use of MD dispensers does not interfere completely with the reproduction of E. kuehniella. However, looking at the overall data, there was a significant reduction in both adults and larvae in treated mills after the MD application. According to hazard analysis and critical control point procedures, treatment should be accompanied by general cleaning of the facilities, including comers and inside machinery, where insects can hide and reproduce. In integrated pest management programs, the use of mating disruption can lead to a drastic reduction in the need for chemical treatments, with improvement in food quality.

TI  - Effects of adult-derived carbohydrates and amino acids on the reproduction of Plutella xylostella
AB  - The use of floral resources to improve the efficiency of natural enemies has grown in recent years, although their effect on pest populations has been overlooked. To understand how access to food resources by adults of Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera Plutellidae) affects their reproduction, the effects of amino acids and carbohydrates (i.e. fructose, glucose and sucrose) on the longevity, lifetime fecundity, egg viability and population growth of this important pest of brassicas are evaluated. Carbohydrate intake increases longevity, oviposition period and lifetime fecundity of P. xylostella. Oviposition period and fecundity are six-fold higher in females that consumed carbohydrates. By contrast, amino acid intake by adults does not affect reproductive parameters, even when mixed with carbohydrates. The estimated demographic parameters indicate that the adult diet is important for pest population growth because the net reproductive rate and the intrinsic rate of increase are higher when females have access to carbohydrates. These results are important from both physiological and ecological points of view. The increasing use of flowering plants as a microhabitat and food source for natural enemies may also result in benefits for herbivorous insects, compromising any success in pest control.

TI  - Pollinators, mates and Allee effects the importance of self-pollination for fecundity in an invasive lily
AB  - Ability to self-fertilize is correlated with invasiveness in several introduced floras, and this has been attributed to its mitigating effect on fecundity when pollinator visitation and mate availability are inadequate. Cross-pollination opportunities are expected to be most limited in isolated individuals and small populations, both typical of the leading edge of an invasion. Thus, self-pollination may promote invasion in part by mitigating pollen-limitation Allee effects., We used emasculation and pollen supplementation experiments to test whether the importance of self-pollination for fecundity increased as plant abundance decreased and isolation increased, in the hawkmoth-pollinated and autonomously self-pollinating invasive lily Lilium formosanum, in its introduced range in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. As inbreeding depression is negligible in these populations, seed production through selfing is likely to be demographically important., In naturalized populations of L. formosanum, varying in size and degree of isolation, emasculation reduced seed production by two-thirds, indicating strong reliance on self-fertilization for fecundity due to inadequate pollinator visitation. However, this was not related to population size and was only greater for more isolated populations in one of the 3 years in which the experiment was carried out. Pollen supplementation experiments showed that pollen limitation was low - 12% on average - and significant in only one of 3 years, demonstrating that autonomous self-pollination was highly effective., In artificial arrays, consisting of plants placed inside naturalized populations or in pairs isolated (3-702 m) from populations, the effect of emasculation on fecundity was greater in isolated plants than those inside the population in one of two populations. Isolation reduced fecundity when emasculated plants were placed next to a second emasculated plant, but not when emasculated plants were partnered with an intact plant, from which they could receive pollen., We conclude that self-fertilization in L. formosanum compensates for inadequate pollinator visitation across all levels of population size and for a pollen-limitation Allee effect due to decreased mate availability in isolated plants, and may thus play an important role in invasion.

TI  - Holocene climate conditions in central Yakutia (Eastern Siberia) inferred from sediment composition and fossil chironomids of Lake Temje
AB  - Abstract A 380cm long sediment core from Lake Temje (central Yakutia, Eastern Siberia) was studied to infer Holocene palaeoenvironmental change in the extreme periglacial setting of eastern Siberia during the last 10,000 years. Data on sediment composition were used to characterize changes in the depositional environment during the ontogenetic development of the Lake Temje. The analysis of fossil chironomid remains and statistical treatment of chironomid data by the application of a newly developed regional Russian transfer functions provided inferences of mean July air temperatures (T July) and water depths (WD). Reconstructed WDs show minor changes throughout the core and range between 80 and 120cm. All the fluctuations in reconstructed water depth lie within the mean error of prediction of the inference model (RMSEP=0.35) so it is not possible to draw conclusions from the reconstructions. A qualitative and quantitative reconstruction of Holocene climate in central Yakutia recognized three stages of palaeoenvironmental changes. The early Holocene between 10 and 8ka BP was characterized by colder-than-today and moist summer conditions. Cryotextures in the lake sediments document full freezing of the lake water during the winter time. A general warming trend started around 8.0ka BP in concert with enhanced biological productivity. Reconstructed mean T July were equal or up to 1.5C higher than today between 6.0ka and 5.0ka BP. During the entire late Holocene after 4.8ka BP, reconstructed mean T July remained below modern value. Limnological conditions did not change significantly. The inference of a mid-Holocene climate optimum supports scenarios of Holocene climatic changes in the subpolar part of eastern Siberia and indicates climate teleconnections to the North Atlantic realm.

TI  - The influence of planting date, transgenic Bt maize and hybrid relative maturity on European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera Crambidae) ovipositional patterns
AB  - A three year study was carried out at Hoytville and at Wooster, Ohio, USA from 2006 to 2008 to investigate the influence of planting date, transgenic maize and hybrid maturity on Ostrinia nubilalis ( Hubner) population dynamics and oviposition patterns. Maize plants were planted in late April or early May, mid- May and early June during each year. The moth flight pattern showed bivoltine generations during the three years. The first moth flight peaked in June, with the populations declining during July. The second moth flight peaked in August and declined towards the end of September or early October. Egg mass density did not differ significantly between transgenic and non-transgenic maize of different maturities. Significant differences were observed, however, among planting dates, sampling dates, and sampling date planting date interactions. Generally higher numbers of egg masses from second generation moths were deposited on late planted maize than middle and early plantings.

TI  - Evaluation of the attack rates and level of damages by the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), affecting corn-crops in the northeast of Argentina
AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW) is the most important threat to corn crops in Argentina, and there exists very little up-to-date information on its actual pest status because the available literature was published more than 20 years ago. Therefore, field surveys were carried out in the northeast of Argentina, in order to establish the attack rates and injury levels of the pest in relation to the crop phenology. The study was carried out at two localities Colonia Bentez, an agricultural region, and Tapenag, a cattle-raising area. At each site two 1-ha plots were sown either with a Bt-corn expressing Cry 1F protein or with an untransformed corn germplasm. Optimal and late sowing was assayed and FAW larval abundance, relative age composition, attack rates and level of damage to corn were recorded. At the moment of the field experiments, Bt-corn was not affected by FAW larvae. However, untransformed germplasms were severely affected by FAW larvae, with an average of attacked plants of 18% or more. In contrast to data obtained 30 years ago, higher values of FAW density were registered. Levels of damage to corn plants were higher after the V4 stage. It was found that the sowing date affected the infestation levels and early seeding avoided high armyworm densities that develop later in the season; in northern Argentina, this was only relevant in agricultural areas.

Se llevaron a cabo estudios de campo a fin de establecer las tasas de ataque y los niveles de dao de la plaga en relacin con la fenologa del cultivo en el noreste de Argentina. El estudio se realiz en dos localidades Colonia Bentez, zona agrcola, y Tapenag, zona ganadera. En cada localidad se sembraron dos parcelas de una hectrea, una con maz transgnico expresando la protena Bt Cry 1F y la otra con su correspondiente isognico no transformado.

En el momento del ensayo de campo, el maz Bt no fue afectado por la plaga; sin embargo, el isognico (sin gen Bt) fue atacado con una media superior al 18% de plantas daadas. Comparando con datos obtenidos hace 30 aos en esta regin, se obtuvieron mayores valores de densidad de larvas/planta. Los niveles de dao fueron mayores despus de V4. La fecha de siembra incide en los niveles de infestacin siembras tempranas evitan las altas densidades del cogollero que se desarrollan durante el verano, pero para la regin estudiada esto solo fue relevante en la zona agrcola.

TI  - Geometrid outbreak waves travel across Europe
AB  - We show that the population ecology of the 9- to 10-year cyclic, broadleaf-defoliating winter moth ( Operophtera brumata) and other early-season geometrids cannot be fully understood on a local scale unless population behaviour is known on a European scale., Qualitative and quantitative data on O. brumata outbreaks were obtained from published sources and previously unpublished material provided by authors of this article. Data cover six decades from the 1950s to the first decade of twenty-first century and most European countries, giving new information fundamental for the understanding of the population ecology of O. brumata., Analyses on epicentral, regional and continental scales show that in each decade, a wave of O. brumata outbreaks travelled across Europe., On average, the waves moved unidirectionally ESE-WNW, that is, toward the Scandes and the Atlantic. When one wave reached the Atlantic coast after 9-10 years, the next one started in East Europe to travel the same c. 3000 km distance., The average wave speed and wavelength was 330 km year1 and 3135 km, respectively, the high speed being incongruous with sedentary geometrid populations., A mapping of the wave of the 1990s revealed that this wave travelled in a straight E-W direction. It therefore passed the Scandes diagonally first in the north on its way westward. Within the frame of the Scandes, this caused the illusion that the wave moved N-S. In analogy, outbreaks described previously as moving S-N or occurring contemporaneously along the Scandes were probably the result of continental-scale waves meeting the Scandes obliquely from the south or in parallel., In the steppe zone of eastern-most and south-east Europe, outbreaks of the winter moth did not participate in the waves. Here, broadleaved stands are small and widely separated. This makes the zone hostile to short-distance dispersal between O. brumata subpopulations and prevents synchronization within meta-populations., We hypothesize that hostile boundary models, involving reciprocal host-herbivore-enemy reactions at the transition between the steppe and the broadleaved forest zones, offer the best explanation to the origin of outbreak waves. These results have theoretical and practical implications and indicate that multidisciplinary, continentally coordinated studies are essential for an understanding of the spatio-temporal behaviour of cyclic animal populations.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in the control failure likelihood of the tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta
AB  - Insecticide resistance is frequently associated with field control failure, but such an assessment of its likelihood seldom occurs. This phenomenon is a potential cause of the control failure of the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta ( Lepidoptera Gelechiidae); therefore we surveyed insecticide resistance as the control failure likelihood for a duration of 7 years in 20 field populations of this species. The insecticide label rate was used as the discriminating concentration, and the minimum efficacy threshold required for insecticides in Brazil (i.e. 80% efficacy) was the targeted efficacy. The spatial and temporal variations of the control failure likelihood were also assessed, as was the potential influence of land topography for the area-wide pattern observed. Most populations of T. absoluta were susceptible to abamectin, chlorfenapyr and spinosad and not to bifenthrin, triflumuron and teflubenzuron. The indoxacarb susceptibility varied in space and time. Spatial dependence was observed for abamectin and indoxacarb. The control failure likelihood of T. absoluta was higher for bifenthrin, triflumuron and teflubenzuron. A flat topography and the wind direction may favour the spread of the control failure likelihood and should be considered in designing pest management programs for T. absoluta.

TI  - The problem of conifer species migration lag in the Pacific Northwest region since the last glaciation
AB  - Abstract Multiproxy evidence indicates that warmer-than-present summers became established in Eastern Beringia as early as 14,00013,000 years ago, but the dispersal of spruces, pines, cedars and hemlocks across the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of southern Alaska did not begin until at least 1500 years afterwards, and took many thousands of years to be completed. There are many potential reasons for this slow spread of PNW conifers towards their modern range limits. The absence of mycorrhizae in the soils of southern Alaska may have slowed conifer establishment. The availability of soil moisture was another limiting factor. With the exception of Pinus contorta, the other PNW conifers become established most readily from seeds that fall on moist, shaded substrates, thus they are not good pioneering species. Competition with alder and birch played an important role, especially along Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula. Alder or alder and birch dominated these regions until the mid- to late Holocene. The other key element for most PNW conifer species is the precipitation regime. The hemlocks, cedars and Sitka spruce are not drought-hardy. So although the PNW temperature regime may have been warm enough in early postglacial times to support the growth of PNW conifers, it was probably too dry for them to successfully become established in new regions. The conflation of these environmental factors limits our present understanding of the problem, but the recent trend of multi-proxy analysis in Quaternary paleoecology will certainly sharpen our reconstructions. Such proxies as conifer needle stomata and insect fossil remains hold significant promise.

TI  - Invading and resident defoliators in a changing climate cold tolerance and predictions concerning extreme winter cold as a range-limiting factor
AB  - 1. Winter temperatures in northern latitudes are predicted to increase markedly as a result of ongoing climate change, thus making the invasion of new insect defoliators possible. The establishment of new outbreak pest species may have major effects on northern ecosystems that are particularly sensitive to disturbances. 2. Effects of winter minimum temperatures under field and laboratory conditions were examined and limitations by minimum temperatures on future range expansion were investigated for invasive [ Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera Geometridae)] and potentially invasive [ Agriopis aurantiaria (Lepidoptera Geometridae)] birch-feeding forest pests. The results for the studied invasive and potentially invasive moths were compared with the parameters of the resident moth species Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera Geometridae). 3. The results showed tolerated critical temperatures of the invader ( O. brumata) and the resident ( E. autumnata) were more similar (differing only by 1 C), whereas the potential invader ( A. aurantiaria) was much less tolerant of cold temperatures. Although describing different stages of overwintering, results were consistent between laboratory and field studies except for those at one field location, at which other abiotic conditions are suggested to have significant influence on moth egg survival. 4. Based on the present results and expected changes in winter temperatures over the next 30 years, the range expansion of an established invasive species may be predicted. No limitations were found regarding the possible future invasion of a new pest species to northern Fennoscandia. The importance of studying a species' whole overwintering period is highlighted and further studies devoted to the effects of other abiotic factors in addition to the effects of temperature are suggested.

TI  - A Lost Link between a Flightless Parrot and a Parasitic Plant and the Potential Role of Coprolites in Conservation Paleobiology
AB  - Late Quaternary extinctions and population fragmentations have severely disrupted animal-plant interactions globally. Detection of disrupted interactions often relies on anachronistic plant characteristics, such as spines in the absence of large herbivores or large fruit without dispersers. However, obvious anachronisms are relatively uncommon, and it can be difficult to prove a direct link between the anachronism and a particular faunal taxon. Analysis of coprolites (fossil feces) provides a novel way of exposing lost interactions between animals (depositors) and consumed organisms. We analyzed ancient DNA to show that a coprolite from the South Island of New Zealand was deposited by the rare and threatened kakapo (Strigops habroptilus ), a large, nocturnal, flightless parrot. When we analyzed the pollen and spore content of the coprolite, we found pollen from the cryptic root-parasite Dactylanthus taylorii . The relatively high abundance (8.9% of total pollen and spores) of this zoophilous pollen type in the coprolite supports the hypothesis of a former direct feeding interaction between kakapo and D. taylorii . The ranges of both species have contracted substantially since human settlement, and their present distributions no longer overlap. Currently, the lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata ) is the only known native pollinator of D. taylorii, but our finding raises the possibility that birds, and other small fauna, could have once fed on and pollinated the plant. If confirmed, through experimental work and observations, this finding may inform conservation of the plant. For example, it may be possible to translocate D. taylorii to predator-free offshore islands that lack bats but have thriving populations of endemic nectar-feeding birds. The study of coprolites of rare or extinct taxonomic groups provides a unique way forward to expand existing knowledge of lost plant and animal interactions and to identify pollination and dispersal syndromes. This approach of linking paleobiology with neoecology offers significant untapped potential to help inform conservation and restoration plans. Un Eslabn Perdido entre un Loro No Volador y una Planta Parsita y el Papel Potencial de Coprolitos en Paleobiologa de la Conservacin (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Resumen Las extinciones a fines del Cuaternario y la fragmentacin de poblaciones han alterado severamente las interacciones animal-planta. La deteccin de interacciones alteradas a menudo depende de caractersticas anacrnicas de plantas, como espinas en ausencia de herbvoros mayores o frutos grandes sin dispersores. Sin embargo, los anacronismos obvios son relativamente poco comunes, y puede ser difcil probar una relacin directa entre el anacronismo y un taxn de fauna particular. El anlisis de coprolitos (heces fsiles) proporciona una nueva manera de exponer interacciones perdidas entre animales (depositantes) y organismos consumidos. Analizamos ADN primitivo para mostrar que un coprolito de la Isla Sur de Nueva Zelanda fue depositado por el kakapo (Strigops habroptilus ), una especie rara y amenazada de loro nocturno, no volador. Cuando analizamos el contenido de polen y esporas del coprolito, encontramos polen del parsito de raz Dactylanthus taylorii . La abundancia relativamente alta (8.9% del total de polen y esporas) de este tipo de polen zofilo en el coprolito soporta la hiptesis de una previa interaccin trfica directa entre kakapo y D. taylorii . La distribucin de ambas especies se ha contrado sustancialmente desde el asentamiento de humanos, y sus distribuciones actuales ya no se traslapan. Actualmente, el murcilago (Mystacina tuberculata ) es el nico polinizador nativo conocido de D. taylorii, pero nuestro hallazgo aumenta la posibilidad de que aves, y otros animales pequeos, pudieron haberse alimentado de y polinizado la planta. Si esto se confirma, mediante trabajo experimental y observaciones, este resultado puede ser til para la conservacin de la planta. Por ejemplo, puede ser posible traloscar D. taylorii a islas sin depredadores que no tengan murcilagos pero con poblaciones florecientes de aves nectarvoras endmicas. El estudio de coprolitos de grupos taxonmicos raros o extintos proporciona una manera nica para expander el conocimiento existente de interacciones planta-animal que se han perdido y para identificar sndromes de polinizacin y dispersin. Este mtodo que liga la paleobiologa con la neobiologa ofrece una ayuda potencial no explotada para planes de conservacin y restauracin.

TI  - From cold to cool in northernmost Norway Lateglacial and early Holocene multi-proxy environmental and climate reconstructions from Jansvatnet, Hammerfest
AB  - Abstract A multi-proxy palaeoecological study of the lateglacial and early Holocene sediments of Jansvatnet, Hammerfest, northernmost Norway (7039 N) showed that cold and arid conditions prevailed in boththe lateglacial interstadial and the Younger Dryas. Terrestrial proxies are macrofossils and pollen. Aquatic proxies are plant and invertebrate macrofossils, pollen, diatoms, and chironomids. Mean July temperatures were reconstructed using pollen and chironomid calibration functions and ecological knowledge of the fossil flora and fauna. Lake-water pH was reconstructed using a diatom pH-calibration function. Above sterile basal deglacial silts, biotic activity was detected around 14600 years ago in the interstadial (chronologically equivalent to the Blling-Allerd in the Greenland Ice-Core Chronology). Catchment vegetation resembled polar desert and ultra-cold stenothermic chironomids lived in the lake. However, diatom assemblages were diverse and dynamic. In the Younger Dryas stadial, conditions deteriorated. In the early Younger Dryas chironomid-inferred air temperatures (CI-Tjul) fell about 1C. Pollen-inferred temperatures (PI-Tjul) did not fall and the terrestrial vegetation hardly changed because of the extreme aridity. The lake water was turbid from suspended clay which diminished aquatic life. Later in the Younger Dryas (ca 12400calyr BP) reconstructed mean July temperatures fell by a further 3C and were close to the minimum to support life, at around 34C. However, decreased turbidity allowed moss growth on the lake bottom that provided habitats for invertebrates and diatoms. In the last 200 years of the Younger Dryas temperatures increased by 23C and terrestrial and aquatic organisms responded quickly. At the start of the Holocene a rapid increase of more than 3C in PI-Tjul to 9.5C initiated the replacement of sparse arctic tundra by low-arctic dwarf-shrub heath. Simultaneously, a further 2C increase in CI-Tjul to 1011C reflected a regime shift in the lake. Aquatic macrophytes rapidly replaced the moss carpet, diatom assemblages stabilised and diatom plankton developed, and cold stenotherm chironomids were replaced by cool-temperate taxa. Productivity increased as CI-Tjul reached a steady maximum of around 12C and PI-Tjul reached 10.5C at about 10000calyr BP. Atthis time, tree-birch arrived and woodland developed over the catchment. Birch could have immigrated from the south up the west coast or from the east along the Barents Sea coast. Acidophilous aquatic taxa increased as diatom-inferred pH gradually decreased from 7.3 to 6.6. After ca 9380calyr BP, the density and extent of birch woodland decreased and species of exposed rocky areas increased, reflecting increased windiness, precipitation, and possibly a small decrease in July temperatures. Birch now formed the arctic tree-line at Jansvatnet. The lateglacial climatic pattern at Jansvatnet resembles patterns detected elsewhere in northern Norway and Svalbard and in marine records from the Norwegian and Barents Seas but contrasts with patterns in southern Norway.

TI  - The population trend of Palpita unionalis in different olive varieties in Egypt
AB  - Jasmine moth (JM), Palpita unionalis (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) is a very important pest in the commercial, densely planted olive orchards in Egypt. In years of its highest population density, it can destroy a significant part of the crop. The objectives of this study were to determine the male flight trend and egg laying trend of the JM in three large plots of different olive varieties (two varieties/plot) in two successive fruiting seasons. Differences in male flight trend and egg laying trend of JM were observed among the different varieties ('Sennara', 'Toffahi', 'Shamy'). In 2003, more males were captured in traps placed in the Sennara/Toffahi plot than in the two Shamy/Toffahi plots. Egg densities were higher on Toffahi trees grown between Sennara trees than on Toffahi trees grown between Shamy ones. In 2004, in the plot where Toffahi and Sennara were grown together, JM females laid more eggs than in the olive plot where Toffahi rows alternated with Shamy rows. The results suggest that the Shamy variety discouraged gravid females from ovipositing, compared with Toffahi or Sennara varieties. In conclusion, olive variety, cropping system (mixed culture) and trapping season are among those characteristics that affect this pest.

TI  - Asymmetric boundary shifts of tropical montane Lepidoptera over four decades of climate warming
AB  - To estimate whether species have shifted at equal rates at their leading edges (cool boundaries) and trailing edges (warm boundaries) in response to climate change. We provide the first such evidence for tropical insects, here examining elevation shifts for the upper and lower boundaries shifts of montane moths. Threats to species on tropical mountains are considered. Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. We surveyed Lepidoptera (Geometridae) on Mount Kinabalu in 2007, 42 years after the previous surveys in 1965. Changes in species upper and lower boundaries, elevational extents and range areas were assessed. We randomly subsampled the data to ensure comparable datasets between years. Estimated shifts were compared for endemic versus more widespread species, and for species that reached their range limits at different elevations. Species that reached their upper limits at 2500-2700 m ( n= 28 species, 20% of those considered) retreated at both their lower and upper boundaries, and hence showed substantial average range contractions (300 m in elevational extent and 45 km in estimated range area). These declines may be associated with changes in cloud cover and the presence of ecological barriers (geological and vegetation transitions) which impede uphill movement. Other than this group, most species ( n= 109, 80% of the species considered) expanded their upper boundaries upwards (by an average of 152 m) more than they retreated at their lower boundaries (77 m). Without constraints, leading margins shifted uphill faster than trailing margins retreated, such that many species increased their elevational extents. However, this did not result in increases in range area because the area of land available declines with increasing elevation. Species close to a major ecological/geological transition zone on the mountain flank declined in their range areas. Extinction risk may increase long before species reach the summit, even when undisturbed habitats are available.

TI  - Are butterflies and moths suitable ecological indicator systems for restoration measures of semi-natural calcareous grassland habitats?
AB  - Abstract The selection of suitable ecological indicator groups is of great importance for environmental assessments. To test and compare two such groups, we performed transect walks of butterflies and light traps of moths at eight sample localities in the Carinthian Alps. All of them were conducted with identical methods in the years 2002 and 2004 allowing the evaluation of the response on the conservation measures performed on five of the eight sites in late 2002. We recorded a total of 2346 butterflies (including Zygaenidae and Sesiidae) representing 83 species and 7025 moths of 534 species. 150 of these species were listed in the Red Data Book of Carinthia. In general, butterflies increased from 2002 to 2004 while moths declined. The highest increase rates of butterflies were obtained for the numbers of individuals of calcareous grassland specialists at the conservation sites, while their numbers were unchanged at the control sites. Similar trend differences between conservation and control sites were obtained for the Red Data Book butterfly species. On the contrary, the development of moth individuals was more positive at the control than the conservation sites for calcareous grassland specialists (only macro-moths) and species of the Red Data Book. However, change rates of species numbers were positively correlated between butterflies and moths. Principal Component Analysis revealed strong differences between the different sites, but mostly consistent results for butterflies and moths; however, stronger differences between years were only detected for some of the conservation sites for the butterfly communities. Our results show that butterflies as well as moths are suitable ecological indicator groups, but they do not yield identical results. Thus, butterflies are more suitable for the analysis of open habitats, whereas moths are suitable for open and forested habitats as well. Furthermore, butterflies might be a more sensitive indicator group than moths for the short-term detection of conservation measures, especially for the restoration of open habitat types.

TI  - Rapid northwards expansion of a forest insect pest attributed to spring phenology matching with sub-Arctic birch
AB  - Species range displacements owing to shifts in temporal associations between trophic levels are expected consequences of climate warming. Climate-induced range expansions have been shown for two irruptive forest defoliators, the geometrids Operophtera brumata and Epirrita autumnata, causing more extensive forest damage in sub-Arctic Fennoscandia. Here, we document a rapid northwards expansion of a novel irruptive geometrid, Agriopis aurantiaria, into the same region, with the aim of providing insights into mechanisms underlying the recent geometrid range expansions and subsequent forest damage. Based on regional scale data on occurrences and a quantitative monitoring of population densities along the invasion front, we show that, since the first records of larval specimens in the region in 1997-1998, the species has spread northwards to approximately 70N, and caused severe defoliation locally during 2004-2006. Through targeted studies of larval phenology of A. aurantiaria and O. brumata, as well as spring phenology of birch, along meso-scale climatic gradients, we show that A. aurantiaria displays a similar dynamics and development as O. brumata, albeit with a consistent phenological lag of 0.75-1 instar. Experiments of the temperature requirements for egg hatching and for budburst in birch showed that this phenological lag is caused by delayed egg hatching in A. aurantiaria relative to O. brumata. A. aurantiaria had a higher development threshold (LDT=4.71 C, LDT=1.41 C), and hatched later and in less synchrony with budburst than O. brumata at the lower end of the studied temperature range. We can conclude that recent warmer springs have provided phenological match between A. aurantiaria and sub-Arctic birch which may intensify the cumulative impact of geometrid outbreaks on this forest ecosystem. Higher spring temperatures will increase spring phenological synchrony between A. aurantiaria and its host, which suggests that a further expansion of the outbreak range of A. aurantiaria can be expected.

TI  - Range expansion of Hyposidra talaca (Geometridae Lepidoptera), a major pest, to Northeastern Indian tea plantations change of weather and anti-predatory behaviour of the pest as possible causes
AB  - Hyposidra talaca (Walk.) is a major pest of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) in Northeastern (NE) India. The present study examined (1) the likely causes of expansion of H. talaca to tea from its ancestral home of sal forests, and (2) the anti-predatory mechanisms that helped it to build up in tea plantations. Studies were made on the role of the regulating agents of the eggs and caterpillars of the pest and responses of caterpillars to different predator-like stimuli (predatory wasps, ants and birds) and mechanical vibrations. Eggs collected from the fields were reared in the laboratory to study egg parasitization and monitored in the field to study the role of natural predators. Prolonged drought and inconsistent rainfall influenced the range expansion of H. talaca. In tea plantations, female moths preferred to conceal the eggs in the scaly bark of shade trees. Excluding woodpeckers, H. talaca eggs were scarcely attacked by other natural enemies. The caterpillars dropped off the plant in response to potential predators and assumed a deimatic U or S shape, and remained motionless when stimulated by mechanical vibration. This study suggests that the lack of specialized natural enemies helped H. talaca to build up in the tea plantations of NE India in a short period of time.

TI  - Prevalence of Nosema sp. (Microsporidia Nosematidae) during an outbreak of the jack pine budworm in Ontario
AB  - Abstract Microsporidia are believed to play little or no role in outbreaks of the jack pine budworm, Choristoneura pinus pinus Freeman (Lepidoptrera Tortricidae), because the short duration (24years) of those outbreaks may not permit significant build-up of the pathogen. We conducted the first survey of Nosema sp. (Microsporidia Nosematidae) over the course of a recent jack pine budworm outbreak in Ontario. Between 2004 and 2010 the outbreak defoliated a cumulative total of 1.78 million ha. Microscopic examination of 15,000 overwintering larvae collected over 6years in sites with densities of 3 larvae per branch or more revealed widespread occurrence of Nosema at generally high infection intensities. The pathogen was present in 69.5% of the 518 plots that were monitored. Prevalence of infection was generally low (below 40% in 84% of plots with infected larvae) but reached high levels (8095%) locally and increased rapidly in most infestations within 12years of onset. We hypothesize that the habit of early-instar larvae to feed on developing male flowers (pollen cones) after spring emergence is critical in allowing rapid build-up of Nosema by increasing efficiency of horizontal transmission (higher density of both infected larvae and egested spores). Nosema infection may contribute to the complexity of jack pine budworm outbreak patterns by affecting egg recruitment and early-instar survival at the stand level in concert with known effects of budworm-induced reductions in pollen cone production on those processes.

TI  - How to increase the value of urban areas for butterfly conservation? A lesson from Prague nature reserves and parks
AB  - Cities contain only a low representation of natural and semi-natural habitats, existing in fragments surrounded by built-up areas. In 20032004, we surveyed butterflies and Zygaenidae moths in 21 reserves and 4 parks within the city of Prague, Czech Republic, situated from the periphery to city centre. A total of 85 species (47% of the Czech fauna of the study groups) was detected, 22 of them being of conservation concern. Ordination analyses of the local assemblages revealed that the richest sites were large, situated far from the city centre, on alkaline bedrocks, south- to southwest oriented, and hosting high numbers of vegetation types and vascular plant species. We then used generalised linear models to fit responses of individual species to the main ordination gradient, corresponding to increasing urbanisation. Out of 60 species that met criteria for the modelling, none responded positively to urbanisation. Twenty displayed negative linear response; these urban avoiders contained a surplus of mesophilous species presumably preferring rural landscapes. Further 29 species (suburban adaptable) responded in domed manners, peaking at the city periphery. Prevailing among them were xerophilous specialists inhabiting large grassland reserves at the Prague outskirts. Finally, eleven urban tolerant species did not respond to urbanisation at all, containing three highly mobile species, three xerothermophilous specialists, and five species utilising shrubs or trees and finding suitable conditions even in urban parks. Suburban adaptable butterflies apparently benefit from such suburban environments as gardens, road or railway verges, collectively increasing the connectivity of remnants of seminatural habitats. The fact that arboreal species persist even in urban parks, whereas common grassland species are absent there, implies that the quality of urban habitats might be increased by a more sensitive management of urban green spaces, such as leaving aside small temporary fallows or adapting lawns mowing schemes.

TI  - Spotted cutworm, Xestia c-nigrum (L.) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) responses to sex pheromone and blacklight
AB  - Traps baited with the sex pheromone blend of (Z7)- and (Z5)-tetradecenyl acetate captured significant numbers of male spotted cutworm moths, Xestia c-nigrum (L.) compared to unbaited traps. Nearly no males were captured in traps baited with (Z7)-tetradecenyl acetate, the major pheromone component. Antennae of spotted cutworm males responded to (Z7)-, (E7)-, (Z5)- and (E5)-tetradecenyl acetate in the laboratory; however there was no response by moths in the field to the E isomers when presented in traps as major and minor components respectively of a binary blend or to the (E7) isomer as a single component. These findings clarify the makeup of a sex attractant that can be used for monitoring X. c-nigrum on agricultural crops in Washington. However, multi-year season-long monitoring of spotted cutworm moths in Yakima Valley apple orchards revealed differential responses to pheromone and blacklight traps. A spring flight period showed a strong moth response to the pheromone compared to blacklight, while a later summer flight period showed a weak moth response to the pheromone relative to blacklight. At this time, we do not know which trap type might best indicate spotted cutworm abundance and risk to crops.

TI  - A tale of two trapping methods Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) in pheromone and light traps in Australian cotton production systems
AB  - Pheromone and light traps have often been used in ecological studies of two major noctuid pests of agriculture in Australia, Helicoverpa armigera and H. punctigera. However, results from these two methods have rarely been compared directly. We set pheromone and light traps adjacent to or amongst cotton and various other crops for 1011 years in the Namoi Valley, in northern New South Wales, Australia. Catches in pheromone traps suggested a major peak in (male) numbers of H. punctigera in early spring, with relatively few moths caught later in the summer cropping season. In contrast, (male) H. armigera were most abundant in late summer. Similar trends were apparent for catches of both male and female H. armigera in light traps, but both sexes of H. punctigera were mostly caught in mid-summer. For both species, males were more commonly caught than females. These catch patterns differed from some previous reports. At least three generations of both species were apparent in the catches. There was some evidence that the abundance of later generations could be predicted from the size of earlier generations; but, unlike previous authors, we found no positive relationships between local winter rainfall and subsequent catches of moths, nor did we find persuasive evidence of correlations between autumn and winter rainfall in central Australia and the abundance of subsequent 1st generation H. punctigera moths. Female H. punctigera were consistently more mature (gravid) and more frequently mated than those of H. armigera. Overall, our results highlight the variability in trap catches of these two species and question the use of trap catches and weather as predictors of future abundance in cropping regions.

TI  - Oviposition of diamondback moth in the presence and absence of a novel host plant
AB  - The diamondback moth (DBM, Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera Plutellidae)) consumes a wide variety of brassicaceous host plants and is a common pest of crucifer crops worldwide. A highly unusual infestation of a sugar pea crop was recorded in Kenya in 1999, which persisted for two consecutive years. A strain (DBM-P) from this population was established in the laboratory and is the only one of several strains tested that can complete larval development on sugar peas. The oviposition acceptance and preference of the DBM-P strain was assessed in the presence of cabbage plants, sugar pea plants or both, in comparison to another strain (DBM-Cj) that was collected from cabbage and is unable to grow on pea plants. As expected, DBM-Cj females preferred to oviposit on cabbage plants. Surprisingly, DBM-P females also laid most eggs on cabbage and very few on peas. However, they laid significantly more eggs on the cabbage plant when pea plants were present. Our findings suggest that DBM-P manifested the initial stages of an evolutionary host range expansion, which is incomplete due to lack of oviposition fidelity on pea plants.

TI  - Phylogenetic island disequilibrium evidence for ongoing long-term population dynamics in two Mediterranean butterflies
AB  - Our aims were to verify the existence of phylogenetic disequilibrium between butterfly lineages at the subcontinental scale for islands and the nearest mainland and to test the capacity of islands for hosting ancestral populations of butterflies and the significance of such relict populations. The western Mediterranean continental area of Europe and North Africa together with several large and small islands (Balearics, Tuscan Archipelago, Aeolian Archipelago, Capri, Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica). Using geometric morphometrics, the shape of male genitalia was analysed in two common butterflies ( Pyronia cecilia and Pyronia tithonus), whose spatial heterogeneity in the Mediterranean region has recently been described. Observed patterns in genital shapes were compared with shapes predicted for islands and fossil islands to assess the contribution of historical and current events in accounting for the transition from a refugial model to an equilibrium model. Measurements were taken for 473 specimens in 90 insular and mainland sites. The shape of the genitalia of populations of most islands differed substantially from that predicted by the equilibrium hypothesis while closely fitting the refugial hypothesis. The comparison between different models strongly suggests that islands maintain ancestral lineages similar to those living in Spain ( P. cecilia) and France ( P. tithonus). A high correlation between observed and predicted patterns on islands and fossil islands occurs during the first steps of modelled introgressive hybridization while the following steps exposed a successively lower fit, suggesting that the process from a refugial to an equilibrium situation is highly skewed towards an earlier non-equilibrium. The observed non-equilibrium pattern supports the refugial hypothesis, suggesting that an ancestral lineage was originally distributed from Spain to Italy, and also occupied offshore islands. This lineage, replaced in Italy, has persisted on the islands owing to their isolation. A comparison of the distribution patterns for genetic and morphometric markers in several species indicates that the situation highlighted for Pyronia may represent a common biogeographic feature for many Mediterranean butterflies.

TI  - Impacts of invasive parasitoids on declining endemic Hawaiian leafroller moths ( Omiodes Crambidae) vary among sites and species
AB  - 1. Invasive parasitoids and predators, both accidentally and purposefully introduced, have variously altered native insect communities worldwide, sometimes causing major declines and extinctions. Most species of endemic Hawaiian leafroller moth in the genus Omiodes (Lepidoptera Crambidae) have suffered range reductions and local extirpations and some species appear to be extinct. Non-native parasitoids, particularly those introduced for biological control, have been implicated in declines of non-target Omiodes and other Hawaiian Lepidoptera. 2. We assessed parasitism rates on Omiodes through controlled exposure trials using Omiodes continuatalis, a species once thought to be extinct due to non-native parasitoids. A total of 2514 O. continuatalis larvae were used in exposure trials on the islands of Maui and Oahu in 2006 and 2007. We also conducted extensive surveys for wild larvae of two target and three non-target Omiodes species, the latter also of conservation concern. Over 4 years, we collected 500 wild larvae across four islands to assess parasitoid impacts and compare results between wild larval collections and controlled exposure. 3. Exposure trials estimated parasitism rates of O. continuatalis from 156% to 653% and field surveys indicated observed parasitism of 81100%, depending upon the species and locality. Accidentally introduced or cryptogenic (of unknown origin) parasitoids were responsible for 857% of parasitism in deployed Omiodes larvae and 566% of observed parasitism in wild Omiodes larvae surveyed in 2007. 4. The variation in these data appears to be associated with habitat level characteristics, which, in combination with species-specific features, may mediate the impacts of non-native parasitoids on Omiodes species. 5. Synthesis and applications. Biological control agents may not be a primary cause of decline or extinction for some native moths. Successful conservation planning for threatened and declining insects will benefit from consideration of the synergistic effects of parasitoids and habitat on a species by species basis.

TI  - Indirect evidence for an extinction debt of grassland butterflies half century after habitat loss
AB  - Abstract Habitat loss often leads to a substantial decline in species richness. However, the extinction of species is typically not instant, but rather involves a time lag. Species richness in recently disturbed habitats is therefore expected to reflect past rather than current habitat availability, with the set of species eventually going extinct representing extinction debt. We explored current species richness of butterflies (Lepidoptera Rhopalocera) and burnet moths (Lepidoptera Zygaenidae) with respect to past and current habitat characteristics. The study was conducted in calcareous grasslands, a habitat that has suffered a rapid decline in Europe during the last century. We showed that species richness of habitat specialists correlated positively with both past (75years ago) and current habitat area, and was best explained by a model incorporating both of these variables. The independent effect of past habitat area presumably indicates the presence of extinction debt in the study region. Species requiring large habitat areas were more likely to show signs of extinction debt. Species richness of other grassland butterflies (those not confined to the focal habitat type) was not associated with past or current habitat area, the pattern indicating their lower sensitivity to changes in focal habitats. The response to habitat loss in specialist butterflies appears faster than in specialist plants, studied in the same landscape earlier. We conclude that linking patterns of species diversity with the temporal dynamics of habitats substantially improves the understanding of the variation in species diversity, and thus helps to identify species of conservation concern.

TI  - Effects of elevated CO2 associated with maize on multiple generations of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera
AB  - Under elevated environmental carbon dioxide (CO2), leaf chewers tend to compensate for decreased leaf nutritional quality with increased consumption; mortality and development times also increase and cause a reduction in the fitness of leaf chewers. However, the effect of elevated CO2 on multiple successive generations of these and other insects is not well understood. Furthermore, information about the direct effects of increased environmental CO2 on developmental time and consumption of herbivores is lacking. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that cascade effects of elevated CO2 through plants, rather than the direct effects of elevated CO2, are the main factors decreasing the fitness of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hbner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae). We used two series of experiments to quantify the growth, development, and consumption of H. armigera fed on an artificial diet or C4 plants (maize) grown under two CO2 levels (ambient vs. double ambient). In the first series of experiments, elevated CO2 had no effect on the population abundance or individual consumption for three successive generations of cotton bollworms fed on an artificial diet. In the second series of experiments, elevated CO2 reduced population abundance of cotton bollworm larvae for two successive generations when they were fed maize milky grains. The specific effects were longer larval duration, lower fecundity, and decreased rm of cotton bollworms. Furthermore, elevated CO2 increased individual consumption when cotton bollworm was fed maize milky grains for two successive generations and decreased the populations total consumption in the first generation but increased it in the second generation. The results from this study indicate that (1) The effects of elevated CO2 on three successive generations of cotton bollworm fed on artificial diet were weak, or even non-existent, and (2) elevated CO2 increased the consumption when cotton bollworm were fed maize. Our study also suggests that the damage inflicted by cotton bollworm on maize (a C4 plant) will be seriously affected by the increases in atmospheric CO2, which is unlike our previous results for spring wheat (a C3 plant).

TI  - The ability of synthetic sex pheromone traps to forecast Plutella xylostella infestations depends on survival of immature stages
AB  - The potential for using synthetic sex pheromone traps as a simple and practical method of monitoring population densities of insect pests has been investigated in many crop systems. Yet, factors enabling the forecast of infestations based on pheromone trap catches are not fully understood. This study tested the prediction that high survival of immature stages of the target pest is a pre-requisite for trap catches to correlate well with future infestations on the crop. The influence of parasitoids, as an important natural mortality factor of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera Plutellidae), larvae and pupae in South Africa, on the ability of pheromone traps to forecast infestations was investigated continuously at weekly intervals over 6 years on unsprayed cabbage. During late OctoberMay, when parasitism levels were high (50%), infestations and trap catches were significantly lower than during low parasitism (<50%) observed during Juneearly October. Because infestations were negatively related to parasitism level, trap catches correlated with infestations better when observations were made in the same week during periods of high parasitism. Conversely, when survival of P. xylostella immature stages was high due to low parasitism levels, trap catches correlated with future infestations well for up to 2 weeks. Thus, trap catches can be used to forecast infestations during SeptemberOctober, a period that coincides with high P. xylostella infestations as a consequence of low natural control by parasitoids. This is the first study to show that the ability of pheromone trap catches to forecast infestations depends on survival of the immature stages of the target pest.

TI  - EXACERBATION OF CITRUS CANKER BY CITRUS LEAFMINER PHYLLOCNISTIS CITRELLA IN FLORIDA
AB  - Citrus canker (caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, Xcc ) is an important bacterial disease of citrus that is spread naturally by rain and wind. Feeding damage to citrus leaves by the citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), has been shown to promote infection levels of citrus canker in a number of citrus-growing regions around the world. We conducted 2 studies to document that CLM damage exacerbates canker in Florida citrus. In 1 study, young citrus trees of 5 cultivars commonly grown in Florida were inoculated with a culture of Xcc . Two groups of trees were studied, 1 group with leaves damaged by CLM and 1 group that was treated with a pesticide to prevent CLM damage. Over all 5 cultivars, comparisons between the 2 groups of trees indicated that CLM damage resulted in 6-fold increase in the number of lesions. No difference was found between the 2 groups with respect to numbers of canker lesions on leaves without CLM damage. In the second study, a survey of commercial citrus groves was conducted to investigate incidence of canker on leaves with and without CLM injury. Low percentages of leaves infected by citrus canker were observed during the survey, with a maximum of 15% of leaves infected in 1 grove. However, during late Jul and Aug in some grapefruit and lemon groves, an average of 79% of leaves with canker had lesions directly associated with CLM damage, and an average of 36 more lesions per leaf was present on leaves with CLM damage. Exacerbation of canker by CLM during Jul and Aug coincided with the time of year when environmental conditions are usually optimal for canker in Florida and when population levels of CLM usually are most abundant. Citrus growers managing citrus canker should benefit from controlling CLM during the summer when conditions are favorable for canker infections, particularly in lemons and grapefruits. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] El cancro de los ctricos (causado por Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, Xcc ) es una enfermedad bacterial importante de los ctricos que es esparcida naturalmente por la lluvia y el viento. Se ha mostrado que el dao a las hojas de ctricos hecho por la alimentacin del minador de la hoja de los ctricos (MHC), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), promueve los niveles de infeccin del cancro de los ctricos en un numero de regiones alrededor del mundo donde siembran ctricos. Realizamos 2 estudios para documentar que el dao hecho por MHC agrava el cancro en los ctricos en la Florida. En el primer estudio, rboles jovenes de ctricos de 5 cultivares sembrados comnmente en la Florida fueron inoculados con un cultivo de Xcc . Dos grupos de rboles fueron estudiados, 1 grupo con las hojas daadas por MHC y 1 grupo que fue tratado con insecticida para prevenir dao hecho por MHC. En todos los 5 cultivares, la comparisin entre los 2 grupos de rboles indico que el dao hecho por MHC resulto en un aumento de 6 veces en el nmero de lesiones. No diferencia fue encontrada entre los 2 grupos con respecto al nmero de lesiones de cancro en las hojas no daadas por MHC. En el segundo estudio, un muestreo de los huertos comerciales de ctricos fue realizado para investigar la incidencia de cancro en las hojas daadas y no daadas por MHC. Bajos porcentajes de hojas infectadas con cancro de los citricos fueron observados durante el muestreo, con un maximo de 15% de las hojas infectadas en 1 de los huertos. Sin embargo, durante la ltima parte de julio y agosto en algunos de los huertos de toronja y limn, un promedio de 79% de las hojas con cancro tenian lesiones directamente asociadas con dao hecho por MHC, y un promedio de 36 mas lesiones por hoja fueron presentes en hojas daadas por MHC. El incremento de cancro por MHC durante julio y agosto coincidi con la epoca del ao cuando las condiciones ambientales usualmente son ptimas para el cancro en la Florida y cuando los niveles de la poblacin de MHC usualmente son mas abundantes. Los agricultores de ctricos que manejan el cancro de ctricos deberian beneficiarse con el control de MHC durante el verano cuando las condiciones son favorables para infecciones de cancro, particularmente en limones y toronjas.

TI  - Population dynamics of Anarsia lineatella in relation to crop damage and the development of economic injury levels
AB  - Developing a relationship between pest abundance and damage to crops is essential for the calculation of economic injury levels (EILs) and to anticipate informed management decisions. Field studies were conducted for three successive years (2005, 2006 and 2007) in peach orchards of northern Greece to examine relationships between densities of Anarsia lineatella Zeller (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) populations and peach ( Prunus persica) yields. According to a linear regression model, the increase in moths densities during the 1st flight resulted in a significant reduction in yield ( y = 0.436 x + 10.22, R2 = 0.635, d.f. = 2,11, P < 0.05). Correlation of male moths captured during the 2nd flight and observed yield loss was significant (y = 0.5231x + 17.204, R 2 = 0.792, d.f. = 2,11, P < 0.05). Moreover, according to a linear model by counting the number of shoot strikes, during the first observation period, a forthcoming yield loss can be estimated ( y = 27.389 x6.304, R2 = 0.711, d.f. 2,11, F = 22.09, P < 0.05). A significant relationship was observed between the numbers of the 2nd generation larvae and yield loss ( y = 163 x, R2 = 0.890). Regression coefficient of the above function represents yield loss per pest and was applied in the calculation of EILs and fixed Economic thresholds (ETs). In addition, parameter of the price commodity was estimated for 2009 by applying stochastic autoregressive moving average model. By integrating above information, EIL and fixed ET estimated as 112 larvae and 84 larvae per sampling unit for a mean value (4/0.1 ha) of cost management tactics and a 90% efficacy.

TI  - Population genetic structure of Cydia pomonella a review and case study comparing spatiotemporal variation
AB  - Analysis of population genetic structure is a key aspect to understand insect pest population dynamics in agricultural scenarios. Here the role of geography, hosts and time on the population genetic structure of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lep., Tortricidae) populations is described. Temporal variation was examined in two French orchards among each of three adult flights during two successive years. Analyses were conducted using two insecticide resistance markers (variation at the sodium channel gene and enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 oxidases) and three microsatellite loci. Levels of genetic variation among temporal populations were not significant based on variation in the sodium channel gene and microsatellite loci. However, P450 oxidase activity differed significantly during both flights and years, decreasing during the three flights of the first year and increasing during the second. These results suggest that phytosanitary measures are among the factors shaping the genetic structure of C. pomonella populations over temporal and geographical scales. We discuss the relative importance of natural and passive dispersal related to anthropogenic activities affecting C. pomonella population genetics and highlight population genetic research needs in order to design more efficient pest management practices.

TI  - Using climatology to predict the first major summer corn earworm Lepidoptera Noctuidae catch in north central Illinois
AB  - One of the largest food production companies in the United States, with sales in the billions of dollars, must closely monitor anything that may affect their vegetable crops. This includes harmful insects, such as the corn earworm CEW Helicoverpa zea, that can reduce sweet corn yields and cause losses of approximately 12 million dollars annually in the Midwest. For this study, a major sweet corn production area located in north central Illinois was used to evaluate CEW moth flight characteristics. The initial major CEW catch i.e. when 10 or more CEWs were caught in a field trap within a 24 h period occurs on average around 20 August. However, during the period from 1960 to 2005 the first major catch occurred between 1 August and 16 September. If climatological information can be used to anticipate the initial major CEW arrival, then pest management strategies can be better implemented and field losses reduced.Seven of 13 years with an early first major CEW arrival 1 to 15 August occurred when accumulated growing degree days GDDs with a base of 10 C were > 917 and the number of warm nights minimum temperatures 18.3 C was above average >21 days from 1 May to 31 July, while 7 of 13 years with a late first major CEW arrival 24 August to 16 September occurred when accumulated GDDs < 853, the number of warm nights was < 18 days, and the number of days with an average air flow from the south was < 30 between 1 May and 31 July.

TI  - A population model for the peach fruit moth, Carposina sasakii Matsumura (Lepidoptera Carposinidae), in a Korean orchard system
AB  - A population model for the peach fruit moth, Carposina sasakii Matsumura, was constructed to understand the population dynamics of this pest species and to develop an effective management strategy for various orchard (apple, peach, apple+peach) systems. The model was structured by the five developmental stages of C. sasakii egg, larva, pupa, larval-cocoon (overwintering larva), and adult. The model consisted of a series of component models (1) a bimodal spring adult emergence model, (2) an adult oviposition model, (3) stage emergence models of eggs, larvae, and pupae, (4) a larval survival rate model in fruits, (5) a larval-cocoon formation model, and (6) an insecticide effect model. Simulations using the model described the typical patterns of C. sasakii adult abundance in various orchard systems well, and was specific to the composition of host plants three adult abundance peaks (first peak, mid-season peak, and last peak) a year with decreased peaks after the first peak in monoculture orchards of late apple, two adult peaks a year with a much higher last peak in monoculture orchards of early peach, and three adult peaks a year with much higher later peaks in mixed orchards of late apple and early peach. The average deviation between model outputs and actual records for first and second adult peak dates was 2.8 and 3.9d, respectively, in simulations without an insecticide effect. The deviation decreased when insecticide effects were incorporated into the model. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of our model, and suggest possible applications of the model.

TI  - Thousand years of climate change reconstructed from chironomid subfossils preserved in varved lake Silvaplana, Engadine, Switzerland
AB  - Abstract Fossil chironomids (non-biting midges) from varved Lake Silvaplana, Switzerland, were used to reconstruct climate (mean July air temperatures) during the last millennium. At the beginning of the record, corresponding to the last part of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (here the period between ca 1032 and 1262 AD), the chironomid-inferred mean July air temperatures were 1C warmer (p<0.01) than the climate reference period (19611990). The Little Ice Age seems to have been separated into three phases significantly colder (1.1C in average, p<0.001) temperatures were inferred between ca 1262 and 1481 AD, between ca 1514 and 1718 AD (1.2C in average, p<0.001) and between ca 1734 and 1782 AD (0.6C in average, p<0.1). Although the average temperature changes inferred by chironomids were within the error of prediction (1.5C) of the chironomid-temperature inference model used for reconstruction, the pattern of temperature changes corresponds well with records of the past millennium in Switzerland, in Europe and in the Northern Hemisphere. The average inferred July temperatures between ca 1900 and 2001 AD were significantly warmer (p<0.05) than the climate reference period (19611990) by 1C which is in agreement with the instrumental data. The inferred July temperatures were in the same range as the inferred temperatures during the last part of the MCA suggesting that during the 20th century, at Lake Silvaplana, the chironomid-inferred temperatures do not exceed the natural climate variability of the past millennium.

TI  - Attract and kill for codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) control in Syria
AB  - The possibility of controlling the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) using an attract and kill approach as an alternative to chemical sprays with contact insecticides was investigated in widely separated orchards. The results of a 4-year study have shown that, using an attract and kill approach, three applications/season kept infestation rates in treated orchards below the economic injury level except in one with a too high codling moth population density. The mean number of male codling moths/trap/week in attract and kill-treated orchards was much lower in comparison with control orchards which were treated with the usual cover sprays of insecticides. The results also showed that the efficacy of attract and kill under orchard conditions decreased with time and the relationship between time effect and codling moth death rate was very strong. These data indicate that the attract and kill technique applied at a rate of three application per season resulted in good control of codling moth in well managed orchards in Syria.

TI  - Tomato leafminer - Tuta absoluta Meyrick ( Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) - current status in Montenegro
AB  - Tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta was detected for the first time in Montenegro using pheromone traps in the middle of July 2010, in greenhouses in one location at the Montenegrin sea coast. In the period from the end of July to the first week of August, moths were captured in pheromone traps from other locations along the sea coast and surroundings of the city of Podgorica. According to the survey carried out by the authors from July to September 2010, T. absoluta was present in greenhouses in all tomato-producing areas, while outdoors it was found only in the coastal area. Monitoring of T. absoluta continued in 2011. Pheromone traps were set up in five locations in the main tomato-producing areas, both in greenhouses and outdoors, between 4 and 15 May. The first captured moths were detected after 7-15 days in all inspected locations, and captures continued until the end of September. According to the number of captured moths and the damage observed, it can be concluded that the population level in 2011 was lower in comparison with 2010, when up to 100% losses were detected in tomato crops in several locations. In 2011, tomato producers were already being informed about the pest and means of control, so most of them applied cultural and chemical control measures. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Tomato leafminer - Tuta absoluta Meyrick ( Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) - current status in Montenegro La mineuse de la tomate Tuta absoluta a t dtecte pour la premire fois au Montngro en utilisant des piges phromones au milieu du mois de juillet 2010 dans les serres en un seul endroit de la cte montngrine. Dans la priode allant de la fin juillet la premire semaine d'aot, des adultes ont t capturs dans des piges phromones dans d'autres lieux le long de la cte et dans les environs de la ville de Podgorica. Selon la prospection ralise par les auteurs entre juillet et septembre 2010, T. absoluta est prsente dans les serres dans toutes les zones de production de tomates, alors qu'elle n'a t trouve en plein champ que dans la zone ctire. Le suivi de T. absoluta a continu en 2011. Des piges phromones ont t mis en place dans cinq sites dans les principales zones de production de tomates, la fois sous serres et au champ, entre le 4 et le 15 mai. Les premires captures ont t dtectes aprs 7-15 jours dans tous les sites inspects et les captures ont continu jusqu' la fin septembre. En considrant le nombre d'adultes capturs et les dommages observs, on peut conclure que le niveau des populations en 2011 tait infrieur celui de 2010, lorsque des pertes atteignant 100% ont t observes en culture de tomates dans plusieurs sites inspects. En 2011, les producteurs de tomates avaient dj des informations sur l'organisme nuisible et les moyens de lutte, et la plupart d'entre eux ont donc appliqu des mesures de lutte culturale et chimique.

TI  - Spatial variability in seed predation in Primula farinosa local population legacy versus patch selection
AB  - Spatio-temporal variation in seed predation may strongly influence both plant population dynamics and selection on plant traits. The intensity of seed predation may depend on a number of factors, but the relative importance of previous predator abundance (local legacy), spatial distribution of the host plant, environmental factors and plant characteristics has been explored in few species. We monitored seed predation in the perennial herb Primula farinosa, which is dimorphic for scape length, during 5 consecutive years, in a 10-km 4-km area comprising 79 P. farinosa populations. A transplant experiment showed that the seed predator, the oligophagous tortricid moth Falseuncaria ruficiliana, was not dispersal limited at the spatial scale corresponding to typical distances between P. farinosa populations. Correlations between population characteristics and incidence and intensity of seed predation varied among years. The incidence of the seed predator was positively correlated with host population size and mean number of flowers, while intensity of seed predation in occupied patches was positively related to the frequency of the long-scaped morph in 2 years and negatively related to host population size in 1 year. In both scape morphs, predation tended to increase with increasing frequency of the long morph. There was no evidence of a local legacy; incidence and intensity of seed predation were not related to the abundance of the seed predator in the population in the previous year. Taken together, the results indicate that among-population variation in seed predation intensity is determined largely by patch selection and that the seed predators preference for tall and many-flowered inflorescences may not only affect selection on plant traits within host plant populations, but also the overall intensity of seed predation.

TI  - Flight periodicity and the vertical distribution of high-altitude moth migration over southern Britain
AB  - The continuous operation of insect-monitoring radars in the UK has permitted, for the first time, the characterization of various phenomena associated with highaltitude migration of large insects over this part of northern Europe. Previous studies have taken a case-study approach, concentrating on a small number of nights of particular interest. Here, combining data from two radars, and from an extensive suction- and light-trapping network, we have undertaken a more systematic, longer-term study of diel flight periodicity and vertical distribution of macro-insects in the atmosphere. Firstly, we identify general features of insect abundance and stratification, occurring during the 24-hour cycle, which emerge from four years' aggregated radar data for the summer months in southern Britain. These features include mass emigrations at dusk and, to a lesser extent, at dawn and daytime concentrations associated with thermal convection. We then focus our attention on the well-defined layers of large nocturnal migrants that form in the early evening, usually at heights of 200-500m above ground. We present evidence from both radar and trap data that these nocturnal layers are composed mainly of noctuid moths, with species such as Noctua pronuba, Autographa gamma, Agrotis exclamationis, A. segetum, Xestia c-nigrum and Phlogophora meticulosa predominating.

TI  - Long-term pheromone-mediated mating disruption of the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella, in a flourmill
AB  - Several studies have indicated that mating disruption (MD) successfully reduces population densities of stored product moths, for example, the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae). However, practical issues, such as finding control plots, replication, and lack of similarity between replicates, often incur problems in full-scale investigations and often draw focus from the added results. We here present results from long-term monitoring of E. kuehniella populations in two similar flourmills in Poland, one treated with pheromone for MD and one left untreated and used as control. Pheromone-mediated MD was applied during 2 years. Thirty pheromone dispensers (one per 100 m3 factory volume), each releasing about 2 mg ( Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate per day, were used. Pheromone-baited traps were used to monitor the moth populations in the MD mill and in a nearby untreated mill. The reduction in trap catch during the MD treatment was about 90% or more, compared with the untreated mill or pre-treatment periods of the MD mill. The reduction was larger during the 2nd year of MD than during the 1st year. These results contribute to the picture that MD is an effective method to control moth species infesting stored products.

TI  - Shifting body weight-fecundity relationship in a capital breeder maternal effects on egg numbers of the autumnal moth under field conditions
AB  - AbstractIn the literature, various environmental factors are described as being capable of influencing the reproductive output of insect females irrespective of their body size. Still, female body size or weight is widely used as a proxy for fecundity. In the present study, a seven-year data set on the autumnal moth, Epirrita autumnata(Borkhausen) (Lepidoptera Geometridae), was used to analyze whether the body weight-fecundity relationship in this capital breeding, cyclic forest defoliating lepidopteran is constant across years. Ambient temperature conditions and density of conspecifics during larval development, the length of the pupal period, as well as moth densities in the parent generation were examined as factors capable of modifying the body weight-fecundity relationship. While the regression slope of potential fecundity (total egg numbers per female) on pupal mass was constant across years, the mean total egg number per given body weight (the regression intercept) was significantly different between years. This residual variance in egg numbers after controlling for the effect of pupal mass was best explained by the pooled geometrid density (autumnal and winter moths) in the parent generation. The total egg number per given body weight decreased with increasing density of geometrid moths in the parent generation. Thus, maternal density effects on offspring fecundity were found in this system. Their rather weak nature suggests, however, that this maternal effect alone does not have the potential of causing cyclic population dynamics in the autumnal moth.

TI  - Distance and quality of natural habitat influence hawkmoth pollination of cultivated papaya
AB  - Crop pollination by wild pollinators is an ecosystem service of immense value to modern agriculture. Pollination by wild insects is under-researched in the tropics, where many crops may require or benefit from wild pollinators. Papaya is a dioecious tree crop widely cultivated throughout the tropics. In East Africa, papaya is an important component of rural smallholder farming systems. Traditional agricultural systems are currently under stress due to landscape degradation. These trends are of special concern with respect to pollination services provided by wild insects. Investigation of the role of hawkmoths as pollinators of papaya on subsistence farms in Kenya was conducted over a period of 3 years. Hawkmoths were the most abundant and reliable visitors to both female pistillate and male staminate papaya flowers. Hawkmoths accounted for >95% of legitimate visits and xenogamous pollination of papaya flowers. Hippotion celerio, Nephele comma and Agrius convolvuli were the main pollinators. Sites in two districts with similar climates and natural vegetation, but different levels of habitat degradation were chosen for comparison of pollinators and pollination services. Hawkmoth abundance and visitation rates declined sharply with increasing distance of natural habitat patches from the crop. Fruit set was also reduced at sites with high levels of disturbance/poor agricultural practices. Natural habitat containing larval food plants and other nectar resources for hawkmoths therefore supports adjacent cultivated papaya with pollination services. Understanding the links between wild biodiversity, in this case pollinating hawkmoths, and agricultural productivity can help bridge the gap between agricultural development and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - RESISTANCE AMONG CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER GERMPLASM TO THE BANDED SUNFLOWER MOTH (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) IN THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS
AB  - A five year field trial evaluated 71 oilseed sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., accessions, 32 breeding lines, and 25 interspecific crosses for resistance to infestation by naturally occurring populations of the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes Walsingham (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), in North Dakota. Germplasm with resistance to attack by the banded sunflower moth and subsequent larval feeding damage in the seeds was identified. PI 251902 had less than 10% feeding damage per head in all five years of testing and less than 6% in three of the five years. PI 372259 and PI 170401 exhibited 12% or less seed damage in three years of evaluation and PI 253776 had only 3% damage in two of the three years and was the least damaged in 2004. Four other accessions (PI 170385, PI 291403, PI 494859, and PI 505651) revealed resistance in three of five years. A number of the interspecific crosses which were retested based on earlier results showed reduced seed damage in 2003, but subsequently exhibited much greater damage the following year due to higher populations of banded sunflower moth. Hybrid 894 was earlier used by others as a susceptible check; however, in the current investigation, this hybrid consistently had the lowest average seed damage from C. hospes feeding among the germplasm evaluated. Results from this investigation indicate that there is potential for developing resistant genotypes with reduced feeding injury that will help sunflower producers reduce yield loss due to the banded sunflower moth. In addition, plant resistance can effectively be combined with delayed planting to decrease densities of C. hospes, thus reducing crop losses without disrupting the control of the larvae by parasitoids.

TI  - Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers reveal a Balkan origin for the highly invasive horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae)
AB  - Biological invasions usually start with a small number of founder individuals. These founders are likely to represent a small fraction of the total genetic diversity found in the source population. Our study set out to trace genetically the geographical origin of the horse-chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, an invasive microlepidopteran whose area of origin is still unkown. Since its discovery in Macedonia 25 years ago, this insect has experienced an explosive westward range expansion, progressively colonizing all of Central and Western Europe. We used cytochrome oxidase I sequences (DNA barcode fragment) and a set of six polymorphic microsatellites to assess the genetic variability of C. ohridella populations, and to test the hypothesis that C. ohridella derives from the southern Balkans (Albania, Macedonia and Greece). Analysis of mtDNA of 486 individuals from 88 localities allowed us to identify 25 geographically structured haplotypes. In addition, 480 individuals from 16 populations from Europe and the southern Balkans were genotyped for 6 polymorphic microsatellite loci. High haplotype diversity and low measures of nucleotide diversities including a significantly negative Tajimas D indicate that C. ohridella has experienced rapid population expansion during its dispersal across Europe. Both mtDNA and microsatellites show a reduction in genetic diversity of C. ohridella populations sampled from artificial habitats (e.g. planted trees in public parks, gardens, along roads in urban or sub-urban areas) across Europe compared with C. ohridella sampled in natural stands of horse-chestnuts in the southern Balkans. These findings suggest that European populations of C. ohridella may indeed derive from the southern Balkans.

TI  - Long-distance wind-borne dispersal of the moth Cornifrons ulceratalis (Lepidoptera Crambidae Evergestinae) into the northern Mediterranean
AB  - On October 2006, during an episode of abnormally warm weather, the African moth Cornifrons ulceratalis (Lederer, 1858) was captured simultaneously for the first time in several sites in north-eastern Spain, the Balearic Islands and southern France. A deep depression situated over the Atlantic at the time gave rise to warm south-westerly winds, accompanied by suspended dust, that blew towards the north-western Mediterranean Basin. Back trajectories of air masses at two different altitudinal levels indicate that the moths most probably originated from an area located in Morocco and northern Algeria, where C. ulceratalis can be extremely abundant. With winter approaching, this invasion of a typically non-migratory species into the north-western Mediterranean Basin provides a good example of the so-called "pied piper" phenomenon, by which wind-borne insects may be carried into areas unfavourable for survival or reproduction. However, because climate change may make the establishment of this and other African species more likely in the future, we suggest that monitoring of this process may become an essential issue in the coming years.

TI  - Cameraria ohridella 10 years of sex pheromone and kairomone research
AB  - This review traces the identification and use of sex pheromone of the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella Deschka et Dimi (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae, Lithocolletinae) to monitor population density and discuss its potential for direct control. Host volatiles endogenously emitted from Aesculus hippocastanum L. leaves are described in terms of their ability to control conspecific females.

TI  - Record of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lep, Pyralidae) in inland South Africa and its genetic relationship with the coastal population
AB  - Surveys to investigate the distribution and abundance of stem borers in natural habitats were conducted in February 2006 and JanuaryFebruary 2007. The surveys included eastern, northern and central parts of South Africa as well as three localities in Lesotho. During the surveys, Eldana saccharina Walker was recovered from three new localities in inland South Africa and two new indigenous hosts, Phragmites australis Cav. and Panicum maximum Jacq. from Boskop in the North-West Province and Oribi Gorge in KwaZulu-Natal respectively. Populations of E. saccharina in different parts of Africa are known for their differences in larval feeding behaviours, host plant choice and natural enemies. It is important to understand the origin of the newly recovered population for prevention of incursion and efficient management in case it invades crops. Molecular analysis indicated that the populations recovered in these new locations and from the new host plants are part of the southern African population of E. saccharina. With change in climate, and disturbance in wetlands the insect is expected in the future to be more abundant and problematic in inland areas of southern Africa.

TI  - Long-term land-use changes and extinction of specialised butterflies
AB  - 1. Land-use change in 450 ha in southern Sweden between 1814 and 2004 was recorded. Butterflies and burnet moths were surveyed in 19041913 and 20012005. 2. We explore if local extinctions were related to land-use changes and species attributes. 3. Land use changed drastically over the 190-year period, and the largest relative change occurred for hay meadows with late harvest, which decreased from 28% to 0%. The area changed from grasslands and grazed forests to being dominated by timber forests. Previous open grazed mixed woodlands changed to spruce plantations with clear-cuts. 4. Of the 48 resident butterfly and burnet moths found a century ago, 44% have become extinct. The extinct Aporia cratgi, Colias palaeno, and Leptidea sinapis were abundant 100 years ago and had their highest densities in flower-rich glades in forest, a habitat which no longer exists. 5. The butterfly extinctions could be predicted from species-specific attributes as a short flight length period ( P<0.02), narrow habitat breadth ( P<0.02), small distribution area in Europe ( P=0.033) and possibly larvae food plant nitrogen class ( P<0.06). In a multiple logistic regression, the flight length period was the only significant variable because the independent variables were intercorrelated. 6. We conclude that the most important factor explaining the high extinction rate is that flower-rich habitats have disappeared from both woodlands as well as from open farmlands. The most sensitive species are specialised species with a short summer flight which have gone extinct. Only the most unspecialised species still persist in the current landscape.

TI  - Fecundity of the autumnal moth depends on pooled geometrid abundance without a time lag implications for cyclic population dynamics
AB  - 1. The abundance and fecundity-related body size variation of the cyclic autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata were monitored from the early increase phase and throughout the outbreak to the end of the density decline in northernmost Norway during 19992006. Another geometrid, the winter moth Operophtera brumata, did not increase in density until the autumnal moth had its post-peak in 2004, and was at its own peak concurrent with the steeply declining autumnal moth abundance in 200506. 2. The body size variables measured (forewing lengths of males and females and hind femur lengths of males) of the autumnal moth showed a similar density-dependent response, i.e. increasing density was associated with decreasing body size and fecundity. Nevertheless, regression analyses clearly ranked the pooled geometrid abundance without a time lag as the best predictor for the body size variation, ahead of the abundance of the autumnal moth or past abundance of all geometrids. 3. Nondelayed effects of lowered food quality and absolute shortage of foliage under congested conditions are the most plausible reasons for reduced body size. 4. Two most commonly proposed causal factors of the autumnal moth population cycle, i.e. delayed inducible resistance of the host plant (mountain birch Betula pubescens czerepanovii) and delayed density-dependent parasitism by specialized hymenopteran parasitoids, cannot easily explain the diverging population trends between the autumnal and winter moths. 5. We suggest that either the inducible resistance of the host tree or the host utilization of the most important parasitoids and/or pathogens have to be strictly species-specific between these closely related moth species to produce the population dynamics observed. That fecundity of the autumnal moth was best related to the pooled geometrid abundance weakens support for the former hypothesis, while our lack of host-specific information limits conclusions about the role of natural enemies.

TI  - Interaction of a newly established immigrant, soybean looper Thysanoplusia orichalcea and the indigenous green looper Chrysodeixis eriosoma (Plusiinae Noctuidae) in New Zealand
AB  - Soybean looper Thysanoplusia orichalcea (Plusiinae Noctuidae) moths were first intercepted in New Zealand in 1984 by light trapping that was being used as a surveillance tool for new lepidopteran pests; in particular, noctuid species from Australia. This prompted studies on larval infestations to separate the impact of T. orichalcea caterpillars from that of the closely related indigenous green looper, Chrysodeixis eriosoma. Subsequent studies described here show that the establishment phase took place over c. 3 years and that, rather than replacing the resident green looper, soybean looper added to the population density of plusiine caterpillars in several field crops, especially lucerne, parsley, soybeans, brassicas, and lettuce. The increases in larval populations caused by T. orichalcea in soybeans were documented from 1980 to 1989, with total plusiine populations reaching c. 46/m of row compared with c. 10/m of row for C. eriosoma. Light trap catches of moths confirmed the increasing abundance of T. orichalcea. By 1990 it represented 87% of the plusiine moths trapped at Pukekohe. This case history supports the use of light traps as a surveillance tool to provide biosecurity warnings and to initiate establishment and impact surveys for incursions of new noctuid pests.

TI  - Miocene vertebrate and invertebrate burrows defining compound paleosols in the Pawnee Creek Formation, Colorado, U.S.A
AB  - Abstract Ichnofossils from two compound paleosols in the middle Miocene Pawnee Creek Formation (PCF) of northeastern Colorado, U.S.A., indicate a diverse soil ecosystem that included plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. The 24m thick paleosols are characterized by blocky textures, shallow depth calcareous horizons overlying silty bioturbated horizons, calcareous nodules, dense mats of fine (<1mm diameter) rhizoliths in the upper 750mm, 510mm diameter rhizoliths up to 3 m deep, and burrows 2800mm in diameter. PCF paleosols likely formed within a shrubland and grassland environment. Ichnofossils include backfilled burrows with chambers and cocoons; simple backfilled burrows; small-diameter boxworks; cylindrical burrow complexes; large, scratch-marked burrow networks; large downward spiraling burrows; large subhorizontal burrows; and gravel-filled tunnels and chambers. These unique PCF ichnofossils include three new ichnogenera and eight new ichnospecies. Ichnofossils attributed to ground beetles, ants, reptiles, and mammals represent a complex variety of behaviors including temporary to permanent dwelling, nesting, and food storing. Rhizoliths and burrows used to interpret media consistency, organic content, soil moisture, and water-table level are tiered from shallow, intermediate, to deep levels within paleosols with respect to physical and biological factors. Separate bioturbated intervals permits the recognition of two different paleosols that otherwise might not have been recognized. Such well-developed paleosols with high densities of terrestrial burrows have substantial sequence stratigraphic significance since they define surfaces of low sedimentation, base level, and accommodation. The PCF ichnofossil assemblages represent at least three distinct ichnocoenoses. The Kladosystemites ichnocoenosis, with Kladosystemites, Polychoredrites, Parowanichnus, and 110mm diameter rhizoliths, is present in the upper profile of well-drained, consolidated, and nutrient-rich paleosols with dense concentrations of small-to-large plants at the surface. The Beaconites ichnocoenosis, with Beaconites, Katarrhedrites, and 510mm rhizoliths, is present in the lower profile of moderately organic paleosols above the influence of the water table but subject to seasonally variable saturated and unsaturated conditions due to precipitation. The Daimonelix ichnocoenosis, with Daimonelix, Beaconites, small-to-large Katarrhedrites, and 510mm diameter rhizoliths, is present in the lower profile of very organic-rich paleosols generally above the influence of the water table but subject to seasonally variable saturated and unsaturated conditions. Integration of data from body fossils, ichnofossils, paleosols, and sedimentary environments provides new insight into Neogene ecosystems. Paleosol properties combined with the ichnofossil distribution, abundance, and diversity indicates that Miocene PCF paleosols formed under a seasonal climate subject to wide variation in temperature and precipitation. The diverse assemblage of burrow morphologies records adaptation of the local fauna to these environmental conditions. The response of soil ecosystems to short- and long-term changes in climate is, therefore, vital to any study of the effects of climate change in the geologic record.

TI  - Effects of host-plant shift on immune and other key life-history traits of an eruptive Geometrid, Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen)
AB  - 1. Population density of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera Geometridae) reaches outbreak densities regularly in northernmost Scandinavia. During these outbreak years, the most abundant host species, the mountain birch ( Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), is regularly exhausted, although larvae may rescue themselves from starvation by using alternative host species. 2. In this paper, the effects of the shift of host species on the immune defence and other life-history traits of E. autumnata were investigated, and possible consequences for population dynamics were briefly discussed. Moth larvae were reared on the leaves of the main host, mountain birch, until larvae reached their third instar. After this, larvae were allocated randomly to five treatments larvae were either allowed to finish larval stage on the mountain birch or were shifted onto four alternative host species that are typical species for the area. 3. As expected, the host species had a major effect on fitness traits body weight, development, and survival rate of the moths. The pupal weight was lower and development rates slower on the three alternative host species, Salix myrsinifolia Salisb., Vaccinium uliginosum L., and Betula nana L., than on the main host, mountain birch. 4. The immunity was, however, the same or better on the alternative hosts than on the main host. The immunity and pupal weights were negatively related, suggesting a trade-off between body size and immunocompetence. 5. The decreased body size and fecundity of E. autumnata during outbreak years may be partly due to the shift to alternative host species whereas the host-plant species probably does not affect markedly the rate of parasitism.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny and population structure of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) in Central Europe I. Ancient clade splitting revealed by mitochondrial haplotype markers
AB  - Abstract The codling moth (Cydia pomonella L., Tortricidae, Lepidoptera) is an important pest of pome fruit with global distribution. It has adapted successfully to different habitats by forming various ecotypes and populations, often termed strains, which differ among each other in several morphological, developmental, and physiological features. Many strains of Cydia pomonella have developed resistance against a broad range of chemically different pesticides. Obviously, pesticide-resistant strains must have a genetic basis inherent to the gene pool of codling moth populations, and this deserves our particular attention. The primary intention of the present study was to contribute novel information regarding the evolutionary phylogeny and phylogeography of codling moth populations in Central Europe. In addition, we aimed at testing the hypothesis that differential biological traits and response patterns towards pesticides in codling moth populations may be reflected at a mitochondrial DNA level. In particular, we wanted to test if pesticide resistance in codling moths is associated repeatedly and independently with more than one mitochondrial haplotype. To this end, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA and constructed phylogenetic trees based on three mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase I (COI), the A+T-rich region of the control region (CR), and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5). The results indicate that Central European populations of Cydia pomonella are clearly divided in two ancient clades. As shown by means of a molecular clock approach, the splitting of the two clades can be dated to a time period between the lower and middle Pleistocene, about 1.290.20 million years ago. It is assumed that the cyclic changes of warm and cold periods during Pleistocene may have lead to the geographic separation of codling moth populations due to glaciation, giving rise to the formation of the two separate refugial clades, as already shown for many other European animal species. Due to their inclination towards developing novel detoxification gene variants, codling moth individuals from both clades independently and multifariously may have developed pesticide resistance, and this process may be ongoing. During their more recent evolutionary history, natural events such as the gradual disappearance of climate-specific geographic barriers, as well as human-aided dispersal in recent historic times, may have allowed codling moth haplotypes from the original clades to interbreed and completely merge again, creating a globally successful insect species with a gene pool capable of responding to novel selective challenges by rapid adaptation.

TI  - Tracking pyrethroid resistance in the polyphagous bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera(Lepidoptera Noctuidae), in the shifting landscape of a cotton-growing area
AB  - AbstractIn cotton-growing areas of Central Africa, timing of host crops and pest management practices in annual rainfed cropping systems result in a shifting mosaic of habitats that influence the dynamics and resistance of Helicoverpa armigera(H?bner) populations on spatial scales, both within and across seasons. From 2002 to 2006, regional and local resistance was monitored among cotton fields and among the major host plants of the bollworm. From 2002, pyrethroid resistance increased within and across cotton-growing seasons to reach a worrying situation at the end of the 2005 growing season. Cotton crops played a fundamental role in the increase in seasonal resistance, even if the intensive use of insecticides on local tomato crops strongly concentrated resistance alleles in residual populations throughout the off-season. Due to the relative stability of resistance in H. armigerapopulations despite a long off-season, we believe that after the dispersal of the moths southwards at the end of the growing season, reverse migration mainly accounts for the reconstitution of populations at the onset of the following growing season. In addition, local resistance monitoring in 2005 and 2006 showed that it was possible to control the increase in resistance by temporarily stopping the use of pyrethroids during the period of peak infestation of cotton by H. armigera. On the other hand, the similar resistance frequency of populations sampled from sprayed and unsprayed synchronous hosts confirmed the absence of reproductive isolation between adults. As a result, diversity in cropping systems should be encouraged by planting alternative host plants to provide a mosaic of habitats, which in return would provide insecticide-free refuges. The implications for insecticide resistance management in annual cropping systems are discussed.

TI  - Top-down effects on population dynamics of Eriocrania miners (Lepidoptera) under pollution impact does an enemy-free space exist?
AB  - In areas disturbed by pollution, populations of herbivorous insects may reach high densities. This study was conducted to test one of the hypotheses attempting to explain this phenomenon that pollution creates an enemy-free space for herbivores. We monitored the population densities of Eriocrania leaf-mining moths on mountain birch, Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii, in the vicinity of the nickelcopper smelter in Monchegorsk (Kola Peninsula, NW Russia) over twelve years (19942005) and assessed larval mortality from parasitoids, ants and birds. The mean density (mines/birch leaf area) of Eriocrania populations in severely disturbed habitats (industrial barrens) was about 2.7 times higher, and peak densities 24 times higher, than in pristine forests. Temporal population variability (measured as the coefficient of variation of log-transformed densities) increased with an increase in pollution load. The proportion of infested trees was not affected by pollution, but mine distribution among trees was more clumped in the polluted sites. Eriocrania populations in disturbed sites fluctuated independently of each other, whereas populations in forest sites fluctuated in synchrony. Larval mortality caused by parasitoids was lower in disturbed sites only during those years when populations of Eriocrania reached high densities; mortality from ants and birds did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed habitats in either high or low density years. In undisturbed forests the rate of population change correlated negatively with previous-year parasitism, suggesting that parasitoids are the key demographic factor in Eriocrania population dynamics. In the habitats heavily disturbed by pollution no such correlation was found, which means that negative feedback with parasitoids is disrupted parasitoids fail to follow host population growth, thus creating an enemy-free space for Eriocrania leafminers.

TI  - Seasonal mortality factors of the coffee leafminer, Leucoptera coffeella
AB  - AbstractSeasonal population fluctuation of the coffee leafminer, Leucoptera coffeella(Gu?rin-M?neville & Perrottet) (Lepidoptera Lyonetiidae), led to an investigation of its natural mortality factors during the rainy season when the population level is low and during the dry season when population peaks occur. Life-table data were colleted from insecticide-free plots within a 3 ha coffee plantation on the upper, medium and lower canopy. Leafminer mortality was similar among the canopy parts but varied in the two seasons studied. During the rainy season, the generational mortality averaged 94.3%, with 50.2, 33.7 and 10.4% occurring during egg, larval and pupal stages, respectively. During the dry season, total mortality was 89%, with 13.2, 61.0 and 14.8% occurring during egg, larval and pupal stages, respectively. Marginal mortality rates during the rainy season were highest for physiological disturbances, rainfall and egg inviability; but, in the dry season, they were highest for predaceous wasps, physiological disturbances and parasitoids. Egg and larval stages accounted for most of the mortality variation in the rainy season, while the combination of larval and pupal mortality better described the generational mortality in the dry season. Variation in mortality during the rainy season was primarily associated with egg inviability, rainfall and parasitoids. In contrast, predatory wasps and physiological disturbances were the main factors associated with mortality variation during the dry season. These results suggest that weather conditions, natural enemies and plant quality attributes are the main determinants of the population dynamics of L. coffeella.

TI  - The effects of local selection versus dispersal on insecticide resistance patterns longitudinal evidence from diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella(Lepidoptera Plutellidae)) in Australia evolving resistance to pyrethroids
AB  - AbstractWhen strong directional selection acts on a trait, the spatial distribution of phenotypes may reflect effects of selection, as well as the spread of favoured genotypes by gene flow. Here we investigate the relative impact of these factors by assessing resistance to synthetic pyrethroids in a 12-year study of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, from southern Australia. We estimated resistance levels in populations from brassicaceous weeds, canola, forage crops and vegetables. Differences in resistance among local populations sampled repeatedly were stable over several years. Levels were lowest in samples from weeds and highest in vegetables. Resistance in canola samples increased over time as insecticide use increased. There was no evidence that selection in one area influenced resistance in adjacent areas. Microsatellite variation from 13 populations showed a low level of genetic variation among populations, with an AMOVA indicating that population only accounted for 0.25% of the molecular variation. This compared to an estimate of 13.8% of variation accounted for by the resistance trait. Results suggest that local selection rather than gene flow of resistance alleles dictated variation in resistance across populations. Therefore, regional resistance management strategies may not limit resistance evolution.

TI  - Changes in distribution of an archaic moth, Micropterix calthella, in St Petersburg, Russia, between 1989 and 2005
AB  - Aim This work aimed to assess changes in the number of suitable habitats and habitat occupancy by Micropterix calthella (L.) moths (Lepidoptera, Micropterigidae) in the city of St Petersburg between 1989 and 2005. Location The city of St Petersburg, Russia. Methods The study compares results of the survey conducted on 912 June 2005 with data collected in 1989 and is based on the assessment of the quality and occupancy of 103 habitats that were found potentially suitable for M.calthella in 1989. If habitats contained wet microsites with undisturbed litter and dense field layer vegetation with a high abundance of flowering Ranunculus sp., they were considered potentially suitable for M.calthella; in these habitats, moths were searched for on flowers of Ranunculus visually and/or by extensive sweep-netting. Results Both the number of habitats suitable for M.calthella and the number of habitats occupied by this species decreased since 1986 from 103 to 72 and from 58 to 34, respectively. The disappearance of habitats was primarily due to the building of residential blocks within the city (16 sites) and railway renovation (10 sites), while changes in habitat management, primarily in parks and recreation zones (five sites), were less important. The average distance from the city centre to the nearest population of M.calthella increased from 8.7 1.5 to 12.9 3.0 km (mean SE). Main conclusion The data for 2005 fit the prediction that M.calthella moths, which are unable to re-colonize potentially suitable habitats due to their low migratory ability, will disappear from the city. At the present rate of extinction, this process may take some 2030 years to complete (or nearly complete).

TI  - Can life-history and defence traits predict the population dynamics and natural enemy responses of insect herbivores?
AB  - 1. Life-history differences between herbivorous insects with eruptive and latent population dynamics are potentially useful for predicting population size variability. An association has also been demonstrated between herbivorous insect defence traits and the responses of various natural enemies. 2. Here predictions of population dynamics and natural enemy responses based on life-history and defence traits are tested using Gonometa postica Walker and G. rufobrunnea Aurivillius, two Southern Hemisphere Macrolepidoptera (Lasiocampidae) species. The temporal and spatial variation in pupal abundance and patterns of pupal parasitism and predation for both species are described and quantified for the first time. 3. Eleven sites were sampled over four generations across the region where both species have historically reached high population densities. Although there was evidence suggesting that population synchrony is driven by weather patterns, site-specific environmental differences contributed to the observed population variability. This study is the first to quantify the extent of population size variability of a species with an intermediate position on the eruptivelatent population dynamic gradient, where data on insect population dynamics is scarce. 4. Support for the life-historypopulation dynamic relationship was found, as intermediate population size variability for these species was observed. Larval and pupal defence traits, however, were poor and inconsistent predictors of mortality rate. Pupal cocoon structure differences, previously documented for these Gonometa species, may in fact explain the interspecific differences in natural enemy responses found. 5. Predicted population dynamics and natural enemy responses may, however, be overridden by ecological conditions. Nevertheless, life-history and defence traits provide a useful basis for predicting population dynamics of poorly studied species.

TI  - Dieback and recovery in poplar and attack by the hornet clearwing moth, Sesia apiformis(Clerck) (Lepidoptera Sesiidae)
AB  - AbstractA survey of 801 poplar trees in central east England in 1999 demonstrated a correlation between crown dieback and infestation by hornet clearwing moth (Sesia apiformis), induced by a period of drought in 1995?1996. To determine whether trees colonised by S. apiformiswould subsequently deteriorate and die or whether they could recover despite infestation and damage to the stem, all trees in the original survey were re-assessed in 2001, 2003 and 2005. The repeat surveys showed that trees with 70% or less crown dieback in 1999 replaced their canopy and generally improved by 2005, irrespective of the numbers of S. apiformisin the stem, whereas trees that had 75% or more crown dieback in 1999 either died or declined further. The presence of S. apiformisdid not prevent tree recovery, and there was little evidence that infestation slowed the rate of recovery. Populations of S. apiformis, measured in terms of the numbers of adult emergence holes visible in the base of the trees, decreased between 2001 and 2005 at the same time as the amount of dieback visible in the canopy of the poplars markedly decreased. However, the fall in numbers of emergence holes at this time reflected a decline in larval establishment 2?3 years earlier, and indicated that the moth population had responded to a more rapid restoration in the internal state of the trees, which was not reflected immediately by the gradual replacement of dead branches and reduction in dieback symptoms.

TI  - TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF ANTAGONISM AND MUTUALISM IN A GEOGRAPHICALLY VARIABLE PLANT-INSECT INTERACTION
AB  - Variation among sites and years in the local ecological outcome of inter-specific interactions can generate a geographic mosaic of coevolution, as indicated by recent .mathematical models. We evaluated whether local temporal dynamics of ecological outcome in the interaction between the moth Greya politella (Prodoxidae) and its host plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) are likely to mitigate or magnify geographic differences in ecological outcome found in earlier studies. The moths are highly host-specific pollinating floral parasites, and the mutualism can be swamped in some populations by the presence of effective co-pollinators. Hence, differing community contexts can shift the outcome of the interaction from mutualism to commensalism or antagonism During each of four years, we evaluated the effect of Greya oviposition on seed development through a paired design that controlled for plant genotype and microenvironment. At Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge in Washington State, the interaction was significantly mutualistic in all four years. Mutualism in this population was indicated by a higher probability of development of capsules visited by ovipositing Greya than capsules not visited by Greya on tile same plant. At Rapid River, Idaho, the interaction was commensalistic in three years and antagonistic in one year. Antagonism in this population was indicated by selective withering of capsules containing Greya eggs. Overall, the results suggest stable geographic differences in the range of ecological outcomes in this plant-insect interaction under different community contexts.

TI  - ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERING BY CATERPILLARS INCREASES INSECT HERBIVORE DIVERSITY ON WHITE OAK
AB  - By creating or modifying habitats used by other organisms, physical ecosystem engineers can influence local patterns of biological diversity. However, there have been very few empirical studies quantifying engineering effects in different biological systems. In this study, we examined the effect of shelter-building caterpillars on the species richness and guild structure of leaf-chewing herbivores occupying individual white oak (Quercus alba) saplings. For each of two years, we disrupted leaf-tie formation on 93 white oak saplings during a three-week period in early summer that coincided with the peak in leaf-tie construction by the most common leaf-tying caterpillar, Pseudotelphusa sp. (Gelechiidae). We then created artificial leaf ties on 62 of these saplings by clipping together adjacent pairs of leaves (10% of the foliage) on each tree. For 31 of these trees, we also placed a single Pseudotelphusa caterpillar into each artificial tie to examine possible nonengineering effects associated with the caterpillar in addition to its shelter-building activity. One month later, removal of leaf ties had reduced the average density of leaf ties present on a tree by 61% (1999) and 54% (2000). This effect persisted throughout the season, indicating that no species assumed the engineering role of Pseudotelphusa sp. once it was removed. The decrease in shelter availability significantly decreased mean cumulative species richness of leaf-chewing insects by 38% (1999) and 14% (2000) compared to the two artificial tie treatments (with and without caterpillars initially), which did not differ from one another. Herbivore community composition also differed significantly between the removal and artificial tie treatments in both years, due to increased species richness of leaftying caterpillars (1999 and 2000), sawflies (1999 only), and beetles (2000 only) on trees with artificial ties. By creating leaf shelters early in the season, Pseudotelphusa sp. caterpillars have large and...

TI  - Larch- and pine-feeding host races of the larch bud moth ( Zeiraphera diniana) have cyclic and synchronous population fluctuations
AB  - Population cycles of many forest-defoliating insects often show synchronous fluctuations at both intra-specific (spatial synchrony) and inter-specific levels. However, population dynamics of different host-associated biotypes of the same species, such as those of the larch budmoth (LBM), Zeiraphera diniana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), have never been compared. This species causes extensive defoliation of larch forests every 8 to 9 years in the Alps, but it consists of two genetically-differentiated host races, the first one developing on European larch, Larix decidua, and the other one developing on Swiss stone pine, Pinus cembra. The dynamics of Zeiraphera populations have been extensively studied on larch, whereas little is known about larval density and possible population fluctuations on sympatric pines. A larval census on Swiss stone pine was conducted in the Swiss Alps intermittently between 1958 to 2004 and in the French Alps from 1992 to 2004. Population density of Zeiraphera on pine varied up to 5000-fold and showed periodic oscillations, with five peaks in Switzerland and one in France. Because the feeding activity of the pine race is restricted to the elongating shoot of the current year, no conspicuous defoliation of pine trees was noted during years of high larval densities. Zeiraphera populations on pine oscillated in significant synchrony with larch-associated populations, and peak densities were observed either the same year or shifted byone year. Our results did not allow any explanation for cyclic fluctuations of LBM on pine, but the synchrony with the larch race's cycle suggests that studies on genetics as well as on parasitism should be intensified.

TI  - The introduction and release of Chiasmia inconspicua and C. assimilis (Lepidoptera Geometridae) for the biological control of Acacia nilotica in Australia
AB  - Abstract Two geometrid moths Chiasmia inconspicua and Chiasmia assimilis, identified as potential biological control agents for prickly acacia Acacia nilotica subsp. indica, were collected in Kenya and imported into quarantine facilities in Australia where laboratory cultures were established. Aspects of the biologies of both insects were studied and CLIMEX models indicating the climatically favourable areas of Australia were developed. Host range tests were conducted using an approved test list of 74 plant species and no-choice tests of neonate larvae placed on both cut foliage and potted plants. C. inconspicua developed through to adult on prickly acacia and, in small numbers, Acacia pulchella. C. assimilis developed through to adult on prickly acacia and also in very small numbers on A. pulchella, A. deanei, A. decurrens, and A. mearnsii. In all experiments, the response on prickly acacia could be clearly differentiated from the responses on the non-target species. Both insects were approved for release in Australia. Over a three-year period releases were made at multiple sites in north Queensland, almost all in inland areas. There was no evidence of either insects establishment and both colonies were terminated. A new colony of C. assimilis was subsequently established from insects collected in South Africa and releases of C. assimilis from this new colony were made into coastal and inland infestations of prickly acacia. Establishment was rapid at one coastal site and the insect quickly spread to other infestations. Establishment at one inland area was also confirmed in early 2006. The establishment in coastal areas supported a CLIMEX model that indicated that the climate of coastal areas was more suitable than inland areas.

TI  - The applicability of the plant vigor and resource regulation hypotheses in explainingEpiblemagall moth Partheniumweed interactions
AB  - A basic question in insectplant interactions is whether the insects respond to, or regulate plant traits, or a complex mixture of the two. The relative importance of the directions of the influence in insectplant interactions has therefore been articulated through both the plant vigor hypothesis (PVH) and the resource regulation hypothesis (RRH). This study tested the applicability of these hypotheses in explaining the interactions betweenParthenium hysterophorusL. (Asteraceae) and its stem-galling moth,Epiblema strenuanaWalker (Lepidoptera Tortricidae). Parthenium plants exposed to galling were sampled at three sites in north Queensland, Australia, over a 2-year period, and the relationship between gall abundance and plant vigor (plant height, biomass, flowers per plant, and branches per plant) was studied. To test the predictions of PVH and RRH, the vigor of parthenium plants protected from galling using insecticides was compared to galled plants and plants that escaped from galling. The vigor of ungalled plants was less than the vigor of galled plants. The higher plant vigor in galled plants was not due to galling, as was evident from insecticide exclusion trials. The insect seemed to preferentially gall the more vigorous plants. These findings support the predictions of the PVH and are contrary to those of RRH. Since gall abundance is linked to plant vigor, galling may have only a limited impact on the vigor of parthenium. This has implications for weed biological control. If the objective of biological control is to regulate the population of a plant by a galling insect, a preference for more vigorous plants by the insect is likely to limit its ability to regulate plant populations. This may explain the paucity of successes against biocontrol of annual weeds using gall insects.

TI  - Temperature-related fitness costs of resistance to spinosad in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella(Lepidoptera Plutelidae)
AB  - AbstractFitness costs associated with resistance genes expressed in the absence of insecticides affect the evolution of insecticide resistance and the outcome of resistance management programmes. However, measurements of fitness costs may not be straightforward as they vary with environmental conditions. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostellaL. (Lepidoptera Plutellidae), has developed resistance to spinosad, the first insecticide of the Naturalyte class, after only a few years of field application of this product. In this study, we compared the performance of two homogenous strains of P. xylostella, one susceptible (SS) and the other resistant (RR) to spinosad at an unfavourable, low natural temperature regime, a favourable median-fluctuating temperature regime and an unfavourable high-fluctuating temperature regime. The RR strain showed only marginal fitness cost at the median temperature regime. At the low temperature regime, the RR strain failed to produce any viable offspring, while the SS strain achieved positive population growth. At the high temperature regime, the RR strain showed a 33% decrease in intrinsic rate of increase compared to the SS strain. The results demonstrate that fitness costs of resistance to spinosad are temperature-dependent, increasing in scale at unfavourably low and high temperatures; costs were particularly high at low temperatures. Suggestions for designing effective management programmes are made to delay or avoid development of resistance to spinosad by P. xylostellaunder different temperature conditions.

TI  - Changes in distribution of birches and birch-feeding Eriocrania moths in St Petersburg, Russia, between 1986 and 2001
AB  - Aim and location I aimed to assess changes in number and quality of suitable habitats, as well as in habitat occupancy by Eriocrania leafminers (Lepidoptera, Eriocraniidae), which have occurred in central parts of the city of St Petersburg between 1986 and 2001. Methods The study compares results of 2000/2001 with the data of 1986 (published by Kozlov, M.V., Zhurnal Obzsej Biologii (Moscow) , 1988, 49 , 670; Journal of Biogeography , 1996, 23 , 95) and is based on (1) mapping of birch trees in two representative plots (2025 ha) in downtown and on the periphery of the densely built city area, (2) survey of 133 isolated or semi-isolated habitats that were found suitable for Eriocrania in 1986, and (3) presence/absence records of birches (Betula pendula and B. pubescens ) and Eriocrania miners in Petrogradskaya area by using 160 160 m regular grid (same as in 1986; 379 cells). Results Both number of habitats suitable for Eriocrania and number of birch trees in these habitats increased since 1986. Colonization of vacant habitats in the area of sporadic distribution in the years 2000/2001 exceeded the extinction rate by a factor of 4; probability of extinction was highest in low density Eriocrania populations associated with small habitat patches, like solitary birch trees in densely built areas. Proportion of the occupied habitat patches within the zone of sporadic distribution in 2000 (92.4%) was much higher than in 1986 (50.4%); thus the area of the lacuna in distribution range of Eriocrania species, associated with the historical centre of St Petersburg, has decreased since 1986. Main conclusion The data of 2000/2001 fit the prediction (Kozlov, 1996) that Eriocrania moths are able to re-colonize the city areas built before 1950s, where they have been extinct or almost extinct by the mid-1980s.

TI  - Iron age to medieval entomogamous vegetation and Rhinolophus hipposideros roost in South-Eastern Wales (UK)
AB  - Abstract Karst cave systems are well developed in Wales (UK) and, in some instances, constitute important bat roosts. Ogof Draenen, near Blaenavon in south-east Wales, is the most recent major cave discovery (1994) with already >70km of passages explored spanning a vertical range of 148m. With the exception of one small chamber (Siambre Ddu) located directly above the main Ogof Draenen system, very few bats have been noticed inside. Extensive accumulations of guano, attributable to Rhinolophus hipposideros, are however found in parts of the Ogof Draenen system. In places covering many square metres and sometimes building heaps >0.5m thick, these represent volumes not yet found in any other cave system in the British Isles. Although the date of the abandonment of the main Ogof Draenen system as a bat roost remains unknown, six radiocarbon dates on guano from Ogof Draenen place the occupation in the Iron Age to Medieval period at least. Palynological analysis was undertaken on ten samples distributed through the cave. Comparisons were made with a moss polster and a lake mud sample from the area to provide a first approximation of the regional modern pollen rain and with two modern guano samples, one from Siambre Ddu and one from Agen Allwedd cave (5km to the north-west) to provide a temporal comparison with the fossil guano. Agen Allwedd cave currently is one of the largest active roosts for Lesser Horseshoe bats in Britain and lies close to the present northern limit of this endangered species in Europe. The main results are that (1) the cave appears to have been used both as a summer and a winter roost; (2) most of the Ogof Draenen guano is formed within c. 1600 14C years and, if the largest heap is continuous, it has accumulated within 75014C years, i. e. 0.16mm yr1; 3) the fossil guano samples reflect a relatively closed oak forest with more abundant ivy (Hedera) and holly (Ilex) than at present; (4) insect-pollinated plants such as Ilex, Acer, Hedera and Impatiens glandulifera are over-represented in the guano samples; (5) in addition to the usual causes of bat roost decline (pesticides, pollution), in the case of Ogof Draenen, we may add entrance blocked by rock collapse and decline of the local forest cover as well as change in its composition.

This period is dated locally by infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) from ca. 9300 to 5500 years ago. Lacustrine deposits from interdune areas of the central sand sea developed during peak precipitation 9300 years (IRSL) ago. The deposits represent short-lived but permanent lakes characterized by salinity tolerant freshwater snails and ostracodes. Diverse trace fossils exposed on the present-day surface show that the dried out lake sediments became substrates for the dwelling, feeding, and reproductive activities of insects. This period of continued moist conditions with pronounced vegetation cover is recorded in post-lacustrine, wet interdune deposits from the coastal Wahiba Sand Sea. A 4-m thick succession of interdune deposits was dated to ca. 85005500 years (IRSL). This interdune succession shows intense bioturbation by rhizocretions and insect burrows and nests. Both sites of wet interdune deposits show that changes of moist conditions during the Early Holocene wet period can be monitored by a variety of biological indicators. The ecological information of in situ animal species and trace fossil assemblages adds to the understanding how climatic changes are expressed in continental environments.

TI  - Pheromone trap catches of the olive moth, Prays oleae (Bern.) (Lep., Plutellidae) in relation to olive phenology and degree-day models
AB  - The population dynamics of the olive moth, Prays oleae (Bern) (Lep., Plutellidae) was monitored using pheromone traps containing (Z)-7-tetradecenal, from 2000 to 2002 in abandoned and commercial olive groves of Bursa in north-western Turkey. The carpophagous generation lasted significantly longer than the phyllophagous generation. The degree-days required for the anthophagous generation were significantly shorter than that for the phyllophagous and carpophagous generations. The relationship between temperature accumulations and pheromone trap captures of male P. oleae in Bursa olive groves showed a significant sigmoid relationship for the phyllophagous and anthophagous flights. Although there was generally a linear relationship between cumulative male catch and olive tree phenology, the use of the prediction model for insecticide treatments was insufficient. Cumulative male catchdegree days together with the olive tree phenology model can be used as a forecasting method for proper timing of insecticide applications against anthophagous and carpophagous larvae in olive groves.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny and dating of an insular endemic moth radiation inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear genes The genus Galagete (Lepidoptera Autostichidae) of the Galapagos Islands
AB  - Abstract Galagete is a genus of microlepidoptera including 12 nominate species endemic to the Galapagos Islands. In order to better understand the diversification of this endemic insular radiation, to unravel relationships among species and populations, and to get insight into the early stages of speciation, we developed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on the combined mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (555bp) and II (453bp), and the nuclear elongation factor-1 (711bp) and wingless (351bp) genes. Monophyly of the genus is strongly supported in the Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses suggesting a single colonization event by a common ancestor. Two cases of paraphyly observed between species are hypothesized to represent imperfect species limits for G. espanolaensis nested within the G. turritella clade, and introgressive hybridization or lineage sorting in the case of the population of G. protozona from Santa Fe nested within the G. gnathodoxa clade. A geologically calibrated, relaxed molecular clock model was used for the first time to unravel the chronological sequence of an insular radiation. The first split occurring within the Galagete lineage on the archipelago is estimated at 3.30.4million years ago. The genus radiated relatively quickly in about 1.8million years, and gives an estimated speciation rate of 0.8 species per million years. Although the colonization scenario shows a stochastic dispersal pattern, the arrival of the ancestor and the diversification of the radiation coincide with the chronological emergence of the major islands.

TI  - Blackwell Publishing, Ltd. Long-distance dispersal and human population density allow the prediction of invasive patterns in the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella
AB  - 1. After its initial discovery in Macedonia in 1985, during the last 19 years the leafminer moth Cameraria ohridella has invaded most of Central and Western Europe. The species, which causes aesthetic damage to horse chestnuts, is generally observed first in highly populated locations before colonizing the countryside. This pattern is consistent with a stratified dispersal process combining long-distance movements and local diffusion. 2. Using large-scale spatial data on damage caused by Cameraria ohridella in Germany, three stochastic spatial models of spread are compared a diffusion model, a leptokurtic dispersal model and a stratified dispersal model that assumes a two-scale dispersal process. In addition, the association between human population and moth invasion is tested in this last model by linking long-distance infestation probability to human population density. Finally, these spatial models constructed with data from Germany are tested at the European scale and compared to historical records of first occurrence. 3. The fat-tailed dispersal kernel models (leptokurtic and stratified dispersal models) allowing for long-distance dispersal provide better predictions than the diffusion model. Among these models, the stratified dispersal model incorporating the effect of human population density provides the best description of the spread of Cameraria ohridella in Germany in predictive (lowest sum of squared errors) and qualitative (similar fractal dimension) terms. 4. The roles of short-distance and long-distance dispersal in Cameraria ohridella invasion ecology in relation to human population are discussed, together with the models' scale-dependence and limitations.

TI  - Rejuvenation of a mountain birch forest by an Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera Geometridae) outbreak
AB  - In 1955, the mountain birch forest in the Abisko valley of northern Sweden was defoliated by caterpillars of the moth Epirrita autumnata with death of stems of the polycormic trees as a result. Since then, some stands have recovered from surviving trees, producing new shoots while other stands became rejuvenated from basal sprouts. Usually, basal sprouting occurs after the death of whole trees or stems. In this case, extensive basal sprouting occurred in spite of only minor stem mortality. Two associated explanations to these differences were explored (i) the abundant basal sprouting was caused by more top damage (and, hence, a reduced apical dominance) than in stands with less sprouting, (ii) this top damage was caused by a higher caterpillar density in the upper part of trees. Studies made during the outbreak and reported here confirm (i) and reject (ii) by showing that caterpillar densities were lower in the upper part of crowns than in the lower. The more extensive damage in the upper part of crowns may have several explanations. However, a specific sequence of events seemed to produce the rejuvenated stand. The sequence included a severe stress existing before the outbreak (as indicated by a decreased radial stem growth) which was increased by defoliations in two successive years. We, therefore, hypothesize that top dieback was caused by between and within stem competition for depleted carbohydrate resources at the expense of tree tops. The contributions of different types of sprouts to the rejuvenation and prerequisites for an outbreak to rejuvenate stands are discussed.

TI  - ORIGINAL ARTICLE Low diversity but high differentiation the population genetics of Aglaope infausta (Zygaenidae Lepidoptera)
AB  - Aglaope infausta is a thermophilous Zygaenid of Atlanto-Mediterranean origin, distributed in Portugal, Spain, France and north-western Italy reaching its north-eastern distribution limit in western Germany. The local, regional and inter-regional genetic structure of this species is studied in this analysis. The allozymes of 456 individuals from 12 populations (11 from western Germany and one from southern Portugal) were studied by electrophoresis. Six of the 19 loci analysed were monomorphic. Genetic differentiation between populations was high ( FST 0.404), while the mean genetic diversity was low ( He 3.4%). Most (96.5%) of the genetic variance between populations was between the Portuguese and the German samples, but also the differentiation within Germany was considerable ( FSR 0.101). In Germany, A. infausta occurs in two major regions (middle Rhine and Nahe) that are geographically separated, and 55.5% of the genetic variance was found between these two regions. The populations of both areas do not differ in their genetic diversity, but those of the middle Rhine have significantly higher genetic distances among them than the Nahe populations (0.020 and 0.015, respectively). FST was also higher in the middle Rhine region than in the Nahe region (0.089 and 0.045, respectively). Aglaope infausta shows a very low level of genetic heterogeneity for a lepidopteran species. However, this genetic poverty is not affecting the species viability. During the ice ages, differentiation into two genetic lineages occurred, most probably in a south-western and a south-eastern differentiation centre in Iberia. The gap in the distribution range in Germany is clearly reflected in the genetic structure. This differentiation must have developed relatively quickly because western Germany most probably was colonized during the climatic optimum 6000 years ago.

TI  - The radiation of the Cape flora, southern Africa
AB  - The flora of the south-western tip of southern Africa, the Cape flora, with some 9000 species in an area of 90 000 km is much more speciose than can be expected from its area or latitude, and is comparable to that expected from the most diverse equatorial areas. The endemism of almost 70 %, on the other hand, is comparable to that found on islands. This high endemism is accounted for by the ecological and geographical isolation of the Cape Floristic Region, but explanations for the high species richness are not so easily found. The high species richness is accentuated when its taxonomic distribution is investigated almost half of the total species richness of the area is accounted for by 33 'Cape floral clades'. These are clades which may have initially diversified in the region, and of which at least half the species are still found in the Cape Floristic Region. Such a high contribution by a very small number of clades is typical of island floras, not of mainland floras. The start of the radiation of these clades has been dated by molecular clock techniques to between 18 million years ago (Mya) (Pelargonium) and 8 Mya (Phylica), but only six radiations have been dated to date. The fossil evidence for the dating of the radiation is shown to be largely speculative. The Cenozoic environmental history of southern Africa is reviewed in search of possible triggers for the radiations, climatic changes emerge as the most likely candidate. Due to a very poor fossil record, the climatic history has to be inferred from larger scale patterns, these suggest large-scale fluctuations between summer wet (Palaeocene, Early Miocene) and summer dry climates (Oligocene, Middle Miocene to present). The massive speciation in the Cape flora might be accounted for by the diverse limitations to gene flow (dissected landscapes, pollinator specialisation, long flowering times allowing much phenological specialisation), as well as a richly complex environment providing a diversity...

TI  - Species richness and abundance of defoliating Lepidoptera associated with Eucalyptus grandis in Brazil and their response to plant age
AB  - AbstractThe present paper documents patterns of species richness and abundance in Lepidoptera associated with a Eucalyptus grandis plantation, and how these patterns relate to plant age. The large number of species collected (1385), the lack of dominant species and the absence of pest outbreaks during the survey may be related to the high level of plant diversity of the native forest reserves in the area. There was no clear pattern of seasonal variation in species richness, but there were seasonal fluctuations in abundance, with minor defoliator species prevailing in October at the start of the rainy season. Species richness and abundance of Lepidoptera were positively correlated, with both variables decreasing in older plantations. However, the greatest numbers of major outbreak species and minor eucalypt defoliators were observed in plants after the mid-point (6 years old) of their cutting cycle (710 years). This may be because of a larger amount of better-quality plant leaves after this mid-point or the reduction in silvicultural management interventions at this period of the Eucalyptus cutting cycle. The abundance of the main outbreak species observed in the survey, Stenalcidia grosica Schaus (Geometridae), was negatively correlated with plant age. Nonetheless, the effect was weak (r = 0.21, P = 0.03) and we were not able to find further significant correlations between plant age and abundance of the other most frequent and constant species that were collected.

TI  - Influence of adult and egg predation on reproductive success of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera Geometridae)
AB  - We studied the effects of predation and oviposition activity on reproductive success of a late-season moth, Epirrita autumnata by exposing adult females and eggs to predation in their natural habitat in two successive years. Daily survival rates of adult females ranged from 0.4 to 0.8, average being 0.7. Most predation occurred during nights and was caused by harvestmen and other invertebrate predators. Avian predation did not have an effect on adult survival rates, most likely because of the lateness of E. autumnata flight season. Eggs were also preyed upon by invertebrate predators, although a notable proportion of egg mortality was attributable to causes other than predation. Daily survival rates of eggs were more than 0.99. Using modeling based on empirical data on eclosion of female adults, their oviposition behavior and survival rates of adults and eggs, the daily survival rates were translated into population level consequences. Adult predation was estimated to decrease reproductive success of non-outbreaking E. autumnata by 6085 percent and egg mortality by 2040 percent. Predation on adult lepidopterans is a mortality factor potentially as relevant as predation in any other life history stage and thus, should not be ignored in studies of population regulation.

TI  - Pyrethroid resistance of Helicoverpa armigera in Spain current status and agroecological perspective
AB  - The cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) is a major pest on a wide range of crops. Insecticide treatments have been widely used and are currently indispensable for its control in almost all crops, which has resulted in some insecticide resistance. However, information about insecticide resistance of H. armigera in Spain is very limited. The pyrethroid resistance status of H. armigera was investigated in Spain during a 5 years period (19951999). Toxicological bioassays were completed in the laboratory on F1 offspring of 35 field-derived strains collected from a range of crops and other host plants or from light traps. Seven pyrethroids, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, permethrin and fenvalerate were tested. Dosemortality regressions, LD50s and their fiducial limits were estimated by probit analysis. Resistance factors (RF) were estimated at the LD50 level as <F>RF=LD50</F> field strain/LD50 susceptible strain.A substantial inter-strain variation in pyrethroid resistance was evident. Although susceptibility (<F>RF=1</F>), low (<F>RF=2</F>10) or moderate (<F>RF=11</F>30) insecticide resistance were prevalent for most insecticidestrain combinations (107 of 111, 96%), high resistance (<F>RF=31</F>100) to cypermethrin and deltamethrin and very high resistance (<F>RF>100</F>) to lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin were recorded in four cases, some of which were associated with field control failures. Such resistance levels to pyrethroids in European populations of H. armigera had not been previously reported by using experimental bioassay procedures. However, on the whole, pyrethroid resistance in H. armigera in Spain was not as high or widespread compared with situations found in other areas of the world. The current situation in Spain is discussed in relation to potential factors accounting for the development of insecticide resistance IPM implementation and seasonal insecticide resistance patterns as well as migration and cropping structure leading to the existence of refugia.

TI  - Interactions between Operophtera brumata andTortrix viridana on oak new evidence from time-series analysis
AB  - 1. Yearly population estimates of the green oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), and the winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera Geometridae), were taken from the pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, from 1951 to 1966 in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, U.K. Larval mortality from parasitoids was recorded for both species over the same period. 2. Operophtera brumata population density fluctuated around a constant mean, whereas T. viridana population density exhibited a linear decline over the sampling period. Population counts were subjected to time-series analysis after the linear decline was removed from the T. viridana data by detrending. Multiple regression models were built so that variation in the per capita rate of increase of each population could be partitioned among (a) current and previous population density, (b) current and previous population density of the second moth species, and (c) rates of larval parasitism. 3. Multiple regression analysis suggested that variation in the per capita rate of increase of O. brumata could be explained by negative feedback from O. brumata density at T2 (32%), a negative relationship with T. viridana density at T1 (18%), and a positive relationship with parasitism suffered by T. viridana at T1 (24%). 4. The T. viridana population time-series was dominated by a rapid feedback process such that per capita rate of increase at time T was negatively related to population density at time T1, explaining 53% of variance in population growth rate. Per capita rate of increase was unrelated to larval parasitism or densities of O. brumata. 5. In light of previous life-table and experimental studies on O. brumata and T. viridana, the current analyses suggest that pupal predation (data not presented) and interspecific competition are significant determinants of O. brumata population growth rates in Wytham Woods. In contrast, T. viridana population growth rates appear to be...

TI  - Population dynamics of the Indian meal moth demographic stochasticity and delayed regulatory mechanisms
AB  - 1. Laboratory populations of the Indian meal moth [Plodia interpunctella (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae)], undergo sustained periodic fluctuations in abundance. The period is just longer than the generation time. The fluctuations are accentuated in the presence of the P. interpunctella granulosis virus (PiGV). 2. Time series spanning 810 generations from three replicate populations of the virus-free (VF) system and three from the virus-infected (VI) system are investigated using nonparametric autoregressive time series models. 3. The dynamics are concluded to correspond to a third order process consistent with interactions in a three-dimensional stage-structured model for both systems. The functionally different interactive stages are believed to be the egg stage (preyed upon by larvae), small larvae (competing for resources and cannibalized by large larvae) and large larvae (competing for resources). 4. The virus is seen as a modulator of the host vital rates more than an independent agent in a trophic hostpathogen interaction. The virus increases developmental time and decreases fecundity of the moths. 5. A significantly nonlinear additive autoregressive model of order 3 appears to give a parsimonious description of the series. 6. The demographic (birth and death) nature of the stochasticity inherent in the system is explicitly incorporated in the statistical model for the time series by assuming an overdispersed Poisson process. The variability around the skeleton is found to conform closely to this assumption. The demographic nature of the stochasticity cannot be fully understood on the basis of Gaussian (least-squares) models on transformed (variance-stabilized) data. 7. Significant density dependencies are found at a 1-week lag, a 2- to 3-week lag and at a 6- to 7-week lag. These are argued to be the signatures of within-stage...

TI  - Population dynamics of teak defoliator, Hyblaea puera Cram. (Lep., Hyblaeidae) in teak plantations of Bangladesh
AB  - In Bangladesh one to two population peaks of teak defoliator, Hyblaea puera Cram. occurred between late April and July, followed in some years by another flatter peak in August and September. The temporal and spatial distribution of infestation suggested a short-range migration of moth. When general flushing of teak occurs in March-April the population starts building up generation by generation. During early build up phase the infestations are distributed in discrete patches. When a critical density is reached in a patch the newly emerged moths migrate to a newly flushed teak areas. After one to three peaks the population declines due to leaf maturity, natural enemies or density dependant food depletion. Until next flushing season the population remains small, non-migratory but active. This residual population survives on a small but continuous supply of tender leaves prevalent due to phenological variation of teak, and on alternative sources of food. This cycle of ups and downs is repeated every year.

TI  - Variation in herbivory by Yponomeuta mahalebella on its only host plantPrunus mahaleb along an elevational gradient
AB  - 1. The effect of natural variation in abiotic conditions on the herbivory interaction between Prunus mahaleb (Rosaceae) and its monophagous folivore, larvae of Yponomeuta mahalebella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae), was analysed for 2 consecutive years along an elevational gradient in Sierra de Cazorla, south-east Spain. 2. There was a negative correlation between site elevation and mean population herbivory level measured at the end of the growing period of Y. mahalebella. Mortality during larval development was higher at higher elevation sites, and mean adult body mass was higher in lower elevation populations. 3. Variation in temperatures recorded during the larval growth period at different altitudes was the only study factor related to abundance of Y. mahalebella larvae; neither differences in parasitisation rates nor plant features covaried significantly with herbivore abundance. 4. These results support the existence of geographical variation in plant-animal interactions in relation to environmental heterogeneity.

TI  - SITE SUSCEPTIBILITY, POPULATION DEVELOPMENT AND DISPERSAL OF THE PINE BEAUTY MOTH IN A LODGEPOLE PINE FOREST IN NORTHERN SCOTLAND
AB  - (1) The population behaviour of the pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea D & S (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)), in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas) forest (North Dalchork) in northern Scotland was analysed from 1977 to 1984 to see whether part of the forest was intrinsically more susceptible than the rest to attack (as a result of, for example, a greater degree of host-plant susceptibility). Population growth was not significantly greater in the small part of the forest defoliated by larvae in 1984, refuting this hypothesis. Instead, the 1984 outbreak centred on the area where pine beauty moth numbers had been greatest I year after an insecticide control operation in 1979. (2) Large and significant differences were observed in population development in different years. (3) Significant differences in adult emergence (1.5-181.5 m-2) and egg laying (156-5496 eggs per tree) were observed at ten sampling locations throughout the forest in 1985. The number of eggs laid per tree was negatively and significantly correlated with the degree of defoliation caused by pine beauty moth larvae during the previous year. (4) The number of eggs laid per female per site (an estimate of fecundity) ranged from 18 (at the defoliated site) to 163. The fecundity predicted (from a previously derived model) from March-May temperatures was 58 eggs per female. This implies that the moths in the defoliated area were tess fecund than the others, or laid a large proportion of their eggs outside the defoliated area. More than twice as many eggs as expected were found at three sites to the north-west and south-east of the defoliated area. However, densities there, and throughout most of the rest of the forest, were already much greater than the economic threshold, as a result of local population development.

TI  - Seasonal Abundance and Insecticidal Control of Citrus Leafminer in a Citrus Orchard
AB  - Population density of citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), was monitored in a Florida citrus grove for 5 years by scouting weekly for larval-induced mines (leafminer-created tunnels in the leaves) in a replicated citrus plot treated with seven insect control regimes Admire (imidacloprid) applied at 12, 6, 3, or 2-month intervals; Temik (aldicarb) applied annually; Metasystox-R (oxydemeton-methyl) applied annually; or no insect control. Leafminer populations were highest during the warmer months (April to September) and lowest during the cooler months (November to March). Populations peaked during June in all 5 years monitored. Trees treated with Temik or Metasystox-R had the same number of mines as the untreated controls. A biannual treatment with Admire reduced leafminer damage (number of mines) all 5 years compared with the controls. Additional Admire applications further reduced damage during some, but not all, years. A single application of Admire significantly reduced mines in 3 of the 5 years.

TI  - Moth assemblages as indicators of environmental quality in remnants of upland Australian rain forest
AB  - Summary 1. Despite great concern about the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, quantitative studies are still scarce with respect to many major groups and important environments. Well-studied natural reference sites are few. 2. Extensive light trapping surveys for moths were thus carried out in both dry and wet seasons in nine remnants of complex notophyll vine forest on basalt on the Atherton Tablelands in tropical north Queensland, Australia. Three sites had never been cleared, three secondary sites had substantial regrowth, and three sites were newly cleared. 3. A total of 15 632 moths of 835 species was collected, counted and identified. These represent more than 17% of the named Australian fauna of our target families. 4. A principal components analysis (PCA) indicated clear discrimination among assemblages based on forest type. This discrimination did not differ qualitatively between seasons (although abundance levels of moths did) but the pattern was most evident in the smaller dry season samples. 5. Taxa, the relative abundance of which increased significantly with disturbance, were the Arctiinae, Amphipyrinae, Catocalinae, Hadeninae, Heliothinae, Hypeninae, Noctuinae, Plusiinae, Hermeniidae and Phycitinae. In contrast, a number of subfamilies showed a marked decrease in relative abundance with increased disturbance, namely Ennominae, Geometrinae, Larentiinae, Oenochrominae, Epipaschiinae, Lymantriidae and Anthelidae. 6. A weighted sum with importance values based on the eigenvalues associated with each of these taxa derived from the PCA is a powerful predictor set of forest quality. 7. These differential responses may be explained on the basis of broad known and expected host-plant patterns. The results show how moth assemblages are powerful indicators of forest disturbance, and should prompt parallel studies elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Phylogeography and host association in a pollinating seed parasite Greya politella (Lepidoptera Prodoxidae)
AB  - Inferring the historical context of ecological diversification is animportant step in understanding the way that population-level processes result in a diversity of species and interactions in communities.We performed a phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes from the pollinating seed parasite Greya politella (Lepidoptera Prodoxidae) in order to determine the degree to which populations were structured according to geographical location and host-plant association. Ninety-eight individuals were sampled from 29 locations ranging from southern California to western Idaho. Restriction-site variation in 87 individuals (27 populations) was screened by digestion with 11 endonucleases, followed by Southern blotting; 38 restriction-site positions were mapped by double digests. Haplotypes were further defined by generating fragments 251 bases in length via PCR, screening them for sequence variation using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), and sequencing the resulting variants. Parsimony analysis of the resulting 12 restriction-site and 15 sequence haplotypes indicated strong geographical structuring of populations (i) most populations were monomorphic for haplotype; (ii) haplotypes from California and the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington and Idaho) formed robust monophyletic groups. Population structure was significant both within and between the two regions, as reflected by N{sub}ST{end}. Patterns of host-plant association and haplotype phylogeny suggest that populations have recently undergone host-plant shifts in many different parts of the species range, although the direction and number of hostshifts cannot be determined at the present level of sampling resolution.

TI  - Indirect evidence for an extinction debt of grassland butterflies half century after habitat loss [electronic resource]
AB  - Habitat loss often leads to a substantial decline in species richness. However, the extinction of species is typically not instant, but rather involves a time lag. Species richness in recently disturbed habitats is therefore expected to reflect past rather than current habitat availability, with the set of species eventually going extinct representing extinction debt. We explored current species richness of butterflies (Lepidoptera Rhopalocera) and burnet moths (Lepidoptera Zygaenidae) with respect to past and current habitat characteristics. The study was conducted in calcareous grasslands, a habitat that has suffered a rapid decline in Europe during the last century. We showed that species richness of habitat specialists correlated positively with both past (75years ago) and current habitat area, and was best explained by a model incorporating both of these variables. The independent effect of past habitat area presumably indicates the presence of extinction debt in the study region. Species requiring large habitat areas were more likely to show signs of extinction debt. Species richness of other grassland butterflies (those not confined to the focal habitat type) was not associated with past or current habitat area, the pattern indicating their lower sensitivity to changes in focal habitats. The response to habitat loss in specialist butterflies appears faster than in specialist plants, studied in the same landscape earlier. We conclude that linking patterns of species diversity with the temporal dynamics of habitats substantially improves the understanding of the variation in species diversity, and thus helps to identify species of conservation concern.

TI  - Impacts of invasive parasitoids on declining endemic Hawaiian leafroller moths (Omiodes Crambidae) vary among sites and species [electronic resource]
AB  - 1. Invasive parasitoids and predators, both accidentally and purposefully introduced, have variously altered native insect communities worldwide, sometimes causing major declines and extinctions. Most species of endemic Hawaiian leafroller moth in the genus Omiodes (Lepidoptera Crambidae) have suffered range reductions and local extirpations and some species appear to be extinct. Non-native parasitoids, particularly those introduced for biological control, have been implicated in declines of non-target Omiodes and other Hawaiian Lepidoptera. 2. We assessed parasitism rates on Omiodes through controlled exposure trials using Omiodes continuatalis, a species once thought to be extinct due to non-native parasitoids. A total of 2514 O. continuatalis larvae were used in exposure trials on the islands of Maui and Oahu in 2006 and 2007. We also conducted extensive surveys for wild larvae of two target and three non-target Omiodes species, the latter also of conservation concern. Over 4 years, we collected 500 wild larvae across four islands to assess parasitoid impacts and compare results between wild larval collections and controlled exposure. 3. Exposure trials estimated parasitism rates of O. continuatalis from 15''6% to 65''3% and field surveys indicated observed parasitism of 8''1-100%, depending upon the species and locality. Accidentally introduced or cryptogenic (of unknown origin) parasitoids were responsible for 85''7% of parasitism in deployed Omiodes larvae and 56''6% of observed parasitism in wild Omiodes larvae surveyed in 2007. 4. The variation in these data appears to be associated with habitat level characteristics, which, in combination with species-specific features, may mediate the impacts of non-native parasitoids on Omiodes species. 5.Synthesis and applications. Biological control agents may not be a primary cause of decline or extinction for some native moths. Successful conservation planning for threatened and declining insects will benefit from consideration of the synergistic effects of parasitoids and habitat on a species by species basis.

TI  - Long-distance dispersal helps germinating mahogany seedlings escape defoliation by a specialist caterpillar [electronic resource]
AB  - Herbivores and pathogens with acute host specificity may promote high tree diversity in tropical forests by causing distance- and density-dependent mortality of seedlings, but evidence is scarce. Although Lepidoptera larvae are the most abundant and host-specific guild of herbivores in these forests, their impact upon seedling distributions remains largely unknown. A firm test of the mechanism underpinning the Janzen-Connell hypothesis is difficult, even for a single tree species, because it requires more than just manipulating seeds and seedlings and recording their fates. Experimental tests require (1) an insect herbivore that is identified and highly specialised, (2) linkage to an in situ measure (or prevention) of herbivory, and (3) evaluation and confirmation among many conspecific adult trees across years. Here we present experimental evidence for a spatially explicit interaction between newly germinating seedlings of a Neotropical emergent tree, big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, Meliaceae), and caterpillars of a noctuid moth (Steniscadia poliophaea). In the understory of a southeastern Amazon forest, the proportion of attacks, leaf area lost, and seedling mortality due to this specialised herbivore peaked near Swietenia trees, but declined significantly with increasing distance from mature fruiting trees, as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We conclude that long-distance dispersal events (>50 m) provided an early survival advantage for Swietenia seedlings, and propose that the role of larval Lepidoptera as Janzen-Connell vectors may be underappreciated in tropical forests.

TI  - Evolutionary dynamics of rDNA clusters on chromosomes of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) [electronic resource]
AB  - We examined chromosomal distribution of major ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs), clustered in the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), in 18 species of moths and butterflies using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a codling moth (Cydia pomonella) 18S rDNA probe. Most species showed one or two rDNA clusters in their haploid karyotype but exceptions with 4-11 clusters also occurred. Our results in a compilation with previous data revealed dynamic evolution of rDNA distribution in Lepidoptera except Noctuoidea, which showed a highly uniform rDNA pattern. In karyotypes with one NOR, interstitial location of rDNA prevailed, whereas two-NOR karyotypes showed mostly terminally located rDNA clusters. A possible origin of the single interstitial NOR by fusion between two NOR-chromosomes with terminal rDNA clusters lacks support in available data. In some species, spreading of rDNA to new, mostly terminal chromosome regions was found. The multiplication of rDNA clusters without alteration of chromosome numbers rules out chromosome fissions as a major mechanism of rDNA expansion. Based on rDNA dynamics in Lepidoptera and considering the role of ordered nuclear architecture in karyotype evolution, we propose ectopic recombination, i.e., homologous recombination between repetitive sequences of non-homologous chromosomes, as a primary motive force in rDNA repatterning.

TI  - Effect of Pheromone Dispenser Density on Timing and Duration of Approaches by Peachtree Borer [electronic resource]
AB  - The timing and duration of approaches by male peachtree borer Synanthedon exitiosa Say (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) to commercial pheromone dispensers placed singly or at high density in peach orchards was determined by using field-deployed video cameras and digital video recorders. Cameras were trained on one dispenser, and one standard lure was placed in a peach orchard, and on 12 dispensers in a separate orchard where dispensers for mating disruption had been placed at 371 per hectare. Male moth approaches were video recorded at the peak of peachtree borer annual flight, from 13 to 18 August 2009. The mean approach timing (hminsecSD) during the study period was 113312 004643, 114352 004558, and 114121 004554 AM with the single dispenser, high-density dispensers, and lure, respectively. Day-to-day variability in approach timings suggested that there were no biologically significant differences among treatments. The frequency distribution of approach durations varied among treatments, as the high-density dispensers had mostly short approaches, while the distribution of approaches to the single dispenser and lure was wider. The median (interquartile range) approach duration was 3 (2-4), 1 (1-2), and 4 (2-6) seconds with the single dispenser, high-density dispensers, and lure, respectively. The relative rank of median approach durations was constant throughout the period, indicating differences among treatments. This study showed that the presence of pheromone dispensers for mating disruption did not cause an advancement of peachtree borer diel rhythm of response. Shorter approaches to dispensers placed at high density than singly suggest that dispenser retentiveness is not constant with peachtree borer, which may bias estimates of disruption activity as a function of dispenser density.

TI  - Larval instars determination for the European Grapevine Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) based on the frequency distribution of head-capsule widths [electronic resource]
AB  - Morphological measurements such as head-capsule (HC) width can be very useful and accessible tools that may be employed for classifying Lepidopteran larval instars according to stage of life history. The availability of such measures is crucial in the management of larval pests, because their control relies upon making accurate assessment of the life history stage at which larvae has reached in various environmental conditions. Such forecasts are then used in order to estimate the timing of emergence for future adult populations. Previous studies investigated the use of head-capsule widths from field larvae of European Grapevine Moth (EGVM), Lobesia botrana Den. and Schiff., to describe the distributions of the five instars during three generations of the insect. The observations were performed in 1998 and 2002 in a vineyard near Bordeaux. The results presented here increase the scope of earlier methods by providing statistical confidence. Our method was calibrated on a large number of individuals (N =552) issued from our insect culture and uses a nonlinear least-squares parameter estimation to describe the distribution of each larval instar inside each generation. The model was tested on a wild larval population (n =3007) occurring in our experimental vineyard during two complete years. The instar class ranges and boundaries were characterized with the associated probabilities of misclassification. A final classification statistical model is developed for each instar and each generation. From this study, we conclude that larval HC sizes increase statistically according to the generation of the year, and thus is influenced by grape phenology. The statistical tool may be easily used either by technicians or scientists to determine the larval phenological development of wild populations of the EGVM. The extension of the model to other moths is discussed.

TI  - Exacerbation of Citrus Canker by Citrus Leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella in Florida [electronic resource]
AB  - Citrus canker (caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, Xcc) is an important bacterial disease of citrus that is spread naturally by rain and wind. Feeding damage to citrus leaves by the citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), has been shown to promote infection levels of citrus canker in a number of citrus-growing regions around the world. We conducted 2 studies to document that CLM damage exacerbates canker in Florida citrus. In 1 study, young citrus trees of 5 cultivare commonly grown in Florida were inoculated with a culture of Xcc. Two groups of trees were studied, 1 group with leaves damaged by CLM and 1 group that was treated with a pesticide to prevent CLM damage. Over all 5 cultivars, comparisons between the 2 groups of trees indicated that CLM damage resulted in 6-fold increase in the number of lesions. No difference was found between the 2 groups with respect to numbers of canker lesions on leaves without CLM damage. In the second study, a survey of commercial citrus groves was conducted to investigate incidence of canker on leaves with and without CLM injury. Low percentages of leaves infected by citrus canker were observed during the survey, with a maximum of 15% of leaves infected in 1 grove. However, during late Jul and Aug in some grapefruit and lemon groves, an average of 79% of leaves with canker had lesions directly associated with CLM damage, and an average of 36 more lesions per leaf was present on leaves with CLM damage. Exacerbation of canker by CLM during Jul and Aug coincided with the time of year when environmental conditions are usually optimal for canker in Florida and when population levels of CLM usually are most abundant. Citrus growers managing citrus canker should benefit from controlling CLM during the summer when conditions are favorable for canker infections, particularly in lemons and grapefruits.

TI  - Population dynamics of Anarsia lineatella in relation to crop damage and the development of economic injury levels [electronic resource]
AB  - Developing a relationship between pest abundance and damage to crops is essential for the calculation of economic injury levels (EILs) and to anticipate informed management decisions. Field studies were conducted for three successive years (2005, 2006 and 2007) in peach orchards of northern Greece to examine relationships between densities of Anarsia lineatella Zeller (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) populations and peach (Prunus persica) yields. According to a linear regression model, the increase in moth's densities during the 1st flight resulted in a significant reduction in yield (y = 0.436x + 10.22, R = 0.635, d.f. = 2,11, P < 0.05). Correlation of male moths captured during the 2nd flight and observed yield loss was significant (y = 0.5231x + 17.204, R = 0.792, d.f. = 2,11, P < 0.05). Moreover, according to a linear model by counting the number of shoot strikes, during the first observation period, a forthcoming yield loss can be estimated (y = 27.389x-6.304, R = 0.711, d.f. 2,11, F = 22.09, P < 0.05). A significant relationship was observed between the numbers of the 2nd generation larvae and yield loss (y = 163x, R = 0.890). Regression coefficient of the above function represents yield loss per pest and was applied in the calculation of EIL's and fixed Economic thresholds (ET's). In addition, parameter of the price commodity was estimated for 2009 by applying stochastic autoregressive moving average model. By integrating above information, EIL and fixed ET estimated as 112 larvae and 84 larvae per sampling unit for a mean value ([Euro Sign]4/0.1 ha) of cost management tactics and a 90% efficacy.

TI  - Impacts of weather, shade cover and elevation on coffee leafminer Leucoptera coffeella (Lepidoptera Lyonetiidae) population dynamics and natural enemies [electronic resource]
AB  - We assessed the influences of ambient temperature, rainfall, shade cover and elevation on seasonal abundance of coffee leafminer Leucoptera coffeella (Gurin-Mnville) and its natural enemies in coffee farms in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico. Mined coffee leaves were most abundant during the rainy season (i.e. historical average rainfall >200mm/mo, April-November) compared to the dry season (<100mm/mo, December-March), and at low (<600m asl) relative to high (>900m asl) elevations. The abundance of mined leaves increased with rainfall, and decreased with maximum daily temperatures. Coffee leafminer survivorship was highest during the dry season (>40%), when predation was lowest (<10%). Predation was the main source of coffee leafminer mortality, and was greatest during the rainy season (>25%) when coffee leafminer incidence was highest (>30% mined leaves per plant). None of the weather variables that were evaluated (viz. maximum and minimum temperatures, and rainfall) significantly impacted parasitism ratios. Shade cover moderated on-farm temperatures, by reducing maximum daily temperatures and any potential, direct impacts of rainfall on coffee leafminer, by providing partial shelter from rainfall, but did not significantly affect coffee leafminer incidence. In 48h laboratory trials, coffee leafminer oviposition was highest at 28'C (15 eggs/female), minimal at 25'C (3 eggs) and nil at 20'C, and higher during night-time hours (>8 eggs/female/day) compared to day-time hours (<1 egg). Historical average temperatures were higher at low elevation (yearly average ca. 25'C; range=18.0-32.0'C) than at high elevation (ca. 21'C; 13.5-28.5'C), and we predicted that physical environmental conditions (i.e. night-time hours with temperatures>20'C) were permissive of coffee leafminer oviposition during twice as many hours each year at low elevation (4060h) compared to high elevation (2081h). Overall, our results suggested that evident differences in the abundance of coffee leafminer between elevations may be due in considerable part to differences in ambient temperatures, particularly night-time temperatures, rather than rainfall, shade cover, or elevation per se.

TI  - Targeting Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) adults with low-volume applications of insecticides alone and in combination with sex pheromone [electronic resource]
AB  - BACKGROUND Studies surveyed the toxicity of several insecticides against adult codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), and examined the field effectiveness of applying low-volume (12 L ha) sprays alone or in combination with a microencapsulated (MEC) sex pheromone formulation.RESULTS Neonicotinyls, organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids significantly reduced fecundity at concentrations nearly 100-fold lower than their maximum labeled field rate. Field studies in 2005 demonstrated that six applications of esfenvalerate resulted in > 90% reduction in fruit injury versus the untreated check. The addition of the MEC pheromone formulation did not further improve control. Five sprays of esfenvalerate, phosmet and acetamiprid all significantly reduced levels of fruit injury compared with the untreated control in 2006. Esfenvalerate and acetamiprid mixed with the MEC pheromone significantly reduced fruit injury compared with the MEC-only treatment. Significant increases in pest and decreases in predator mite densities occurred in plots treated with esfenvalerate in both years. Low-volume sprays of phosmet and acetamiprid did not disrupt mites.CONCLUSION Low-volume insecticide sprays can effectively manage codling moth and are less disruptive of integrated mite management. Developing an effective 'attract and kill' technology with this approach will require optimization of the attractant(s) to maximize moth exposure to insecticide residues.

TI  - Population genetic structure of Cydia pomonella a review and case study comparing spatiotemporal variation [electronic resource]
AB  - Analysis of population genetic structure is a key aspect to understand insect pest population dynamics in agricultural scenarios. Here the role of geography, hosts and time on the population genetic structure of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lep., Tortricidae) populations is described. Temporal variation was examined in two French orchards among each of three adult flights during two successive years. Analyses were conducted using two insecticide resistance markers (variation at the sodium channel gene and enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 oxidases) and three microsatellite loci. Levels of genetic variation among temporal populations were not significant based on variation in the sodium channel gene and microsatellite loci. However, P450 oxidase activity differed significantly during both flights and years, decreasing during the three flights of the first year and increasing during the second. These results suggest that phytosanitary measures are among the factors shaping the genetic structure of C. pomonella populations over temporal and geographical scales. We discuss the relative importance of natural and passive dispersal related to anthropogenic activities affecting C. pomonella population genetics and highlight population genetic research needs in order to design more efficient pest management practices.

TI  - Field efficacy against the grape root borer Vitacea polistiformis (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) and persistence of Heterorhabditis zealandica and H. bacteriophora (Nematoda Heterorhabditidae) in vineyards [electronic resource]
AB  - Field efficacy and persistence of Heterorhabditis zealandica strain X1 and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora strain GPS11 applied at different times for the control of the grape root borer, Vitacea polistiformis were evaluated from 2001 to 2003 in two vineyards in Ohio and one in Georgia and from 2005 to 2007 in two vineyards in Ohio. Pheromone trapping and pupal case surveys were used to confirm the presence of borers in the vineyards. Nematode applications were targeted at the larval stages of the grape root borer. Percent control based on the number of emerging adults in Ohio ranged from 55% to 92% and in Georgia from 55% to 78%. Overall no significant differences were found in the numbers or timings of nematode application indicating effective control of all GRB instars and a broad window of opportunity for the application of nematodes. The ability of H. zealandica to persist in the soil profile for a period of 1 year was minimal in Ohio and none in Georgia. In contrast, H. bacteriophora persistence in Ohio was positive for all treatments up to 1 year post-treatment and in one case up to 21 months post-treatment. These studies demonstrate the potential of H. bacteriophora strain GPS11 for long-term conservation approach in vineyards for the management of the grape root borer.

TI  - Attract and kill for codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) control in Syria [electronic resource]
AB  - The possibility of controlling the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) using an attract and kill approach as an alternative to chemical sprays with contact insecticides was investigated in widely separated orchards. The results of a 4-year study have shown that, using an attract and kill approach, three applications/season kept infestation rates in treated orchards below the economic injury level except in one with a too high codling moth population density. The mean number of male codling moths/trap/week in attract and kill-treated orchards was much lower in comparison with control orchards which were treated with the usual cover sprays of insecticides. The results also showed that the efficacy of attract and kill under orchard conditions decreased with time and the relationship between time effect and codling moth death rate was very strong. These data indicate that the attract and kill technique applied at a rate of three application per season resulted in good control of codling moth in well managed orchards in Syria.

TI  - Phenology and population radiation of the nettle caterpillar, Darna pallivitta (Moore) (Lepidoptera Limacodidae) in Hawai'i [electronic resource]
AB  - The nettle caterpillar, Darna pallivitta (Moore) (Lepidoptera Limacodidae), is an invasive pest with established populations on three Hawai'ian islands. Indigenous to Southeast Asia, D. pallivitta caterpillars cause defoliation of ornamental nursery stock and pose a human health hazard due to their urticating hairs that can cause painful skin reactions. Identification of the pheromone component n-butyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (E7,9-10COOnBu) from D. pallivitta has made it possible to investigate the phenology and population dynamics using baited traps. Male captures in Jackson traps baited with E7,9-10COOnBu showed a vegetation preference for tall-grass fields and forest/grass interfaces over forest areas. Microlocation preferences were also found for trap height, with over 65% of males being caught in traps suspended at 1 m, compared with the traps at 3 and 5 m. Captures of male moths in traps baited with live females, and direct observations of female calling behavior, showed peak activities 6-7 h after the onset of scotophase. This is a much later communication period than for D. bradleyi and D. trima and may provide a mechanism by which D. pallivitta maintains reproductive isolation in areas where all three species are present. Coastal and inland transects established in eastern Hawai'i measured aspects of population fluctuations and radiation into new areas with relation to elevation and microclimate. Population expansion was measured by comparing moth population means and 80% population boundaries over time. Both population measures showed a higher expansion for the coastal transect. Differences in population expansion may be attributed in part to temperature and elevation, while precipitation does not seem to have a strong effect. Both the behavioral and ecological data collected can be used to optimize deployment of detection/control strategies and to predict population expansion/risk assessment for establishing quarantine protocols for the nettle caterpillar.

TI  - The effect of grape vine cultivars on Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) population levels [electronic resource]
AB  - The European vine moth Lobesia botrana Denis & Schiff. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) is a key pest in the vineyards of Israel and Europe. Traps baited with the female sex pheromone are commonly used to monitor the pest population. However, the role of the vine cultivars on monitoring the moth population using pheromone-baited traps was not yet studied. The present study aimed to identify the effect of grape cultivars on L. botrana adult distribution patterns in the field, in order to achieve a better understanding of the monitored data in respect to male and female's host preference. The 3-year study in commercial vineyards used four cultivars Carignan, Emerald Riesling, French Colombard, and Cabernet Sauvignon. The moth population of each generation was estimated from male counts in pheromone traps; three generations were observed in all experimental orchards, each year. Female host choice was studied by monitoring freshly deposited eggs and newly hatched larvae on vines. The study showed a significant effect of cultivar on numbers of trapped males in most years, and a cultivar effect on female host choice. For both males and females and for all phenological stages of the grapes, Carignan and French Colombard attracted the most and Cabernet Sauvignon the fewest specimens. The results show that cultivar blend within the vineyard can affect the distribution pattern of the pest. Knowledge of the expected choice of the female moth, and of the timing of its decision could lead to an improved monitoring system, with the preferred cultivar as an indicator.

TI  - Life History, Seasonal Phenology, and Parasitoids of the Hawaiian Endemic Moth Udea Stellata (Lepidoptera Crambidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - This study presents basic information on the life cycle, seasonal phenology, and parasitism of the endemic Hawaiian moth Udea stellata (Butler) (Lepidoptera Crambidae), a species for which little biological information is available, even though it was described more than a century ago. By observation of ecdysis and measurements of corresponding head capsule widths under laboratory conditions, we determined that U. stellata undergoes six larval stages. All larval stages had distinct ranges in head capsule width. Duration of each larval stage as well as the egg and pupal stage are reported. Endemic host plants of U. stellata, Pipturus spp. (Urticacea), were sampled at eight field sites between July 2004 and July 2006. Temporal differences in density of larvae were most pronounced in medium- and high-elevation sites, possibly an effect of more marked seasonal temperature changes. The parasitoid assemblage associated with U. stellata consisted of seven species three adventive species, two purposely introduced species, and two of unknown origin. Adventive parasitoids rather than purposely introduced parasitoids were responsible for the greater part of the apparent mortality observed.

TI  - Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers reveal a Balkan origin for the highly invasive horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - Biological invasions usually start with a small number of founder individuals. These founders are likely to represent a small fraction of the total genetic diversity found in the source population. Our study set out to trace genetically the geographical origin of the horse-chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, an invasive microlepidopteran whose area of origin is still unkown. Since its discovery in Macedonia 25 years ago, this insect has experienced an explosive westward range expansion, progressively colonizing all of Central and Western Europe. We used cytochrome oxidase I sequences (DNA barcode fragment) and a set of six polymorphic microsatellites to assess the genetic variability of C. ohridella populations, and to test the hypothesis that C. ohridella derives from the southern Balkans (Albania, Macedonia and Greece). Analysis of mtDNA of 486 individuals from 88 localities allowed us to identify 25 geographically structured haplotypes. In addition, 480 individuals from 16 populations from Europe and the southern Balkans were genotyped for 6 polymorphic microsatellite loci. High haplotype diversity and low measures of nucleotide diversities including a significantly negative Tajima's D indicate that C. ohridella has experienced rapid population expansion during its dispersal across Europe. Both mtDNA and microsatellites show a reduction in genetic diversity of C. ohridella populations sampled from artificial habitats (e.g. planted trees in public parks, gardens, along roads in urban or sub-urban areas) across Europe compared with C. ohridella sampled in natural stands of horse-chestnuts in the southern Balkans. These findings suggest that European populations of C. ohridella may indeed derive from the southern Balkans.

TI  - Record of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lep, Pyralidae) in inland South Africa and its genetic relationship with the coastal population [electronic resource]
AB  - Surveys to investigate the distribution and abundance of stem borers in natural habitats were conducted in February 2006 and January-February 2007. The surveys included eastern, northern and central parts of South Africa as well as three localities in Lesotho. During the surveys, Eldana saccharina Walker was recovered from three new localities in inland South Africa and two new indigenous hosts, Phragmites australis Cav. and Panicum maximum Jacq. from Boskop in the North-West Province and Oribi Gorge in KwaZulu-Natal respectively. Populations of E. saccharina in different parts of Africa are known for their differences in larval feeding behaviours, host plant choice and natural enemies. It is important to understand the origin of the newly recovered population for prevention of incursion and efficient management in case it invades crops. Molecular analysis indicated that the populations recovered in these new locations and from the new host plants are part of the southern African population of E. saccharina. With change in climate, and disturbance in wetlands the insect is expected in the future to be more abundant and problematic in inland areas of southern Africa.

TI  - Optimizing Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) Insecticidal Efficacy in Minnesota Sweet Corn A Logistic Regression to Assess Timing Parameters [electronic resource]
AB  - Late-season plantings of sweet corn in Minnesota result in an abundant supply of silking corn, Zea mays L., throughout August to early September that is highly attractive to the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae). During a 10-yr period, 1997-2006, insecticide efficacy trials were conducted in late-planted sweet corn in Minnesota for management of H. zea. These data were used to develop a logistic regression model to identify the variables and interactions that most influenced efficacy (proportion control) of late-instar H. zea. The pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (0.028kg [AI]/ha) is a commonly used insecticide in sweet corn and was therefore chosen for use in parameter evaluation. Three variables were found to be significant ( = 0.05), the percentage of plants silking at the time of the first insecticide application, the interval between the first and second insecticide applications, and the interval between the last insecticide application and harvest. Odds ratio estimates indicated that as the percentage of plants silking at the time of first application increased, control of H. zea increased. As the interval between the first and second insecticide application increased, control of H. zea decreased. Finally, as the interval between the last insecticide application and harvest increased, control of H. zea increased. An additional timing trial was conducted in 2007 by using lambda-cyhalothrin, to evaluate the impact of the percentage of plants silking at the first application. The results indicated no significant differences in efficacy against late-instar H. zea at 0, 50, 90, and 100% of plants silking at the first application (regimes of five or more sprays). The implications of these effects are discussed within the context of current integrated pest management programs for late-planted sweet corn in the upper midwestern United States.

TI  - Effect of Center Cut Strand Thinning on Fruit Abscission and Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) Infestation in California Date Gardens [electronic resource]
AB  - The carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller), infests different date, Phoenix dactylifera L., fruit stages during the summer months in southern California. Abscised fruit in the kimri stage become heavily infested when they get stuck in tight date bunches and do not fall to the ground. Previous work on date palm horticulture found that the percentage of fruit abscission could be reduced by thinning fruit out of the bunch. Our objective in this study was to determine whether center cut strand thinning reduced fruit abscission and, if so, to determine any concurrent effect on carob moth summer population densities. We found that the center cut treatment did not alter fruit abscission at any of the four date gardens used in the study. However, thinning in May reduced July carob moth densities at the four date gardens by 54-97%. The percentage reduction was apparent into September, ranging from 30 to 81%. This reduction was significant in two of the four fields, and we believe that center cut thinning in these fields altered the bunch architecture, allowing abscised fruit to fall to the ground. Implications for field management of the carob moth are discussed.

TI  - Quantitative food webs of lepidopteran leafminers and their parasitoids in a Japanese deciduous forest [electronic resource]
AB  - Quantitative food webs were constructed to explore the community structure of leaf-mining moths in the family Gracillariidae and their parasitoid wasps in a deciduous forest in Hokkaido, Japan. A whole food web was constructed from data collected from June to October 2001. In the web, 16 leafminer species on seven tree species were attacked by 58 species of hymenopteran parasitoid; 376 links between leafminers and parasitoids were observed. Leafminers were specialist herbivores, but most parasitoids were generalists. Five webs were constructed for the seasonal prevalence of leafminers over the one-year period to reveal the temporal dynamics in community structure. Among the seasonal webs, the first web in June was distinctive because two tree species, Japanese umbrella tree Magnolia obovata and Japanese magnolia M. kobus, supported the community. Second to fourth webs from July to September were dominated by the leafminer species on Japanese oak Quercus crispula, and the fifth web was marked by that on Carpinus cordata. The extent of potential apparent competition among leafminers was evaluated using quantitative parasitoid overlap diagrams. These diagrams suggested that abundant host species are likely to have large indirect effects on less abundant species. Moreover, the potential for apparent competition between leafminer species inhabiting different host tree species can occur, although leafminers sharing the same tree species are prone to interact via shared parasitoids. In this system, particular leafminer species, acting as potential sources of apparent competition, can affect other species as sinks, and control whole-community dynamics. Directed apparent competition may potentially occur around oak trees.

TI  - Elements of Population Dynamics of Bagworm (Lepidoptera Psychidae) on Hedge Rows of White Pine [electronic resource]
AB  - Spatiotemporal elements related to the population dynamics of bagworms, Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Haworth) (Lepidoptera Psychidae), on white pine, Pinus strobus (L.), were investigated by sampling populations of bagworms repeatedly at 12 sites within a 50-km radius in central Indiana. The number of live bagworms declined over time by up to 95% in some sites, and the rate of population decline increased with the initial density of larvae. A comparison of population density of bagworms in past generations with that of the current-year generation revealed that sites heavily infested with bagworms from previous years carried a high number of live larvae early but not late in the season. The positive relationship between densities of bagworms in past and current generations observed at five of 12 sites suggests that larvae commonly do not disperse when they emerge on a suitable host. However, there was considerable variation relative to this pattern, suggesting that dispersal is common as well. Pupation and emergence of adults occurred in late summer and early fall, with some level of phenological asynchrony observed at different sites. Dates corresponding to 50% pupation or adult emergence varied by up to 12 d at different sites. Males suffered higher mortality than females during the pupal stage. The positive correlation between the mortality level of female pupae and previous years' population density may be related to a buildup of populations of natural enemies in sites that were previously heavily infested with bagworms.

TI  - Seasonal biology and management of the maple shoot borer, Proteoteras aesculana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), in production nurseries [electronic resource]
AB  - BACKGROUND Proteoteras aesculana (Riley), a caterpillar that causes tip dieback and kills the central leader of maples, is an important nursery pest. The authors sought to develop a pheromone lure, use it to clarify the pest's seasonal biology, determine when and where infestations originate and extend the management window.RESULTS Gas chromatography, electroantennographic detection and trapping showed that (Z)-dodec-8-en-1-ol (Z8-12OH) is the major sex pheromone component. Flight began in March, peaking in early spring. Larvae developed during April and May, giving rise to moths active in late May and June. No additional larvae were found in maples following that flight. Sporadic moth captures occurred into November, suggesting that adults overwinter. Three parasitoid species, all new host records, were documented. A different tortricid, Episimus tyrius Heinrich, caused leaf-tying damage in late summer. Maples shipped from Oregon were free of shoot borers, refuting speculation that larvae overwinter in buds. One bifenthrin spray applied from just before bud break at onset of moth flight to just after peak flight when shoots had two pairs of leaves reduced infestation by 96-100%.CONCLUSION Maples are infested soon after planting in Kentucky nurseries via eggs laid in early spring. The temporal window for preventive control is broader than previously thought.

TI  - Effects of host-plant shift on immune and other key life-history traits of an eruptive Geometrid, Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen) [electronic resource]
AB  - 1. Population density of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera Geometridae) reaches outbreak densities regularly in northernmost Scandinavia. During these outbreak years, the most abundant host species, the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), is regularly exhausted, although larvae may rescue themselves from starvation by using alternative host species. 2. In this paper, the effects of the shift of host species on the immune defence and other life-history traits of E. autumnata were investigated, and possible consequences for population dynamics were briefly discussed. Moth larvae were reared on the leaves of the main host, mountain birch, until larvae reached their third instar. After this, larvae were allocated randomly to five treatments larvae were either allowed to finish larval stage on the mountain birch or were shifted onto four alternative host species that are typical species for the area. 3. As expected, the host species had a major effect on fitness traits body weight, development, and survival rate of the moths. The pupal weight was lower and development rates slower on the three alternative host species, Salix myrsinifolia Salisb., Vaccinium uliginosum L., and Betula nana L., than on the main host, mountain birch. 4. The immunity was, however, the same or better on the alternative hosts than on the main host. The immunity and pupal weights were negatively related, suggesting a trade-off between body size and immunocompetence. 5. The decreased body size and fecundity of E. autumnata during outbreak years may be partly due to the shift to alternative host species whereas the host-plant species probably does not affect markedly the rate of parasitism.

TI  - Mating Disruption of Citrus Leafminer Mediated by a Noncompetitive Mechanism at a Remarkably Low Pheromone Release Rate [electronic resource]
AB  - The citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), is a worldwide pest of citrus. A season-long investigation was conducted that evaluated mating disruption for this pest. Effective disruption of the male P. citrella orientation to pheromone traps (98%) and reduced flush infestation by larvae was achieved for 221 d with two deployments of a 31 blend of (Z,Z,E)-7,11,13-hexadecatrienal/(Z,Z)-7,11-hexadecadienal at a remarkably low rate of 1.5 g active ingredient (AI)/ha per deployment. To gain insight into the mechanism that mediates the disruption of P. citrella, male moth catch was quantified in replicated plots of citrus treated with varying densities of pheromone dispensers. The densities of septum dispensers compared were 0 (0/ha, 0.0 g AI/ha), 0.2 (one every fifth tree or 35/ha, 0.05 g AI/ha), 1 (215/ha, 0.29 g AI/ha), and 5 per tree (1,100/ha, 1.5 g AI/ha). Profile analysis by previously published mathematical methods matched predictions of noncompetitive mating disruption. Behavioral observations of male P. citrella in the field revealed that males did not approach mating disruption dispensers in any of the dispenser density treatments. The current report presents the first set of profile analyses combined with direct behavioral observations consistent with previously published theoretical predictions for a noncompetitive mechanism of mating disruption. The results suggest that disruption of P. citrella should be effective even at high population densities given the density-independent nature of disruption for this species and the remarkably low rate of pheromone per hectare required for efficacy.

TI  - Influence of Canopy Aspect and Height on Codling Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) Larval Infestation in Apple, and Relationship between Infestation and Fruit Size [electronic resource]
AB  - Monitoring systems based on traps with female attractants are expected to enhance forecasting of insect population size and damage. The optimal placement of such traps should match the small-scale distribution of ovipositing females. In the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), fruit infestation takes place in proximity to the oviposition site. We characterized the within-tree distribution of codling moth infestations and the size of uninfested fruit based on a survey of 40,000 apples (Malus spp.) from trees belonging to 160 different apple genotypes and growing in two different environments. Each tree was subdivided into 12 sectors, considering canopy aspect (north, east, south, and west) and canopy height (bottom, middle, and top). This study revealed that fruit infestation by the first but not by the second generation of larvae correlated significantly with canopy aspect. Similarly, fruit size differed significantly between the north- and the south-facing tree side for the period of infestation by the first but not by the second larval generation. Significantly lower fruit infestation was observed on the north- compared with the south- or east-facing tree side for the first generation. A significant influence of canopy height on larval infestation was observed in three of eight assessments, in which the middle height level showed the highest infestations. Significant differences in within-tree distribution of codling moth infestation suggest that oviposition preference is guided by nonrandom factors including microclimate, fruit phenology, and wind direction. These cultivar-independent findings should be considered in future monitoring systems that focus on female codling moth.

TI  - How to preserve horse chestnut trees from Cameraria ohridella in the urban environment [electronic resource]
AB  - Control of Cameraria ohridella Deschka and Dimic (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), a pest on the horse chestnut tree (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) was tested using systemic injection in the 4-year period (2002-2005). Imidacloprid and abamectin were used with a single systemic tree injection treatment during May, immediately after blossom. A total of 77,760 leaves were sampled in the field to assess the effect on the number of mines caused by the horse chestnut leaf mining moth by comparing population levels in treated vs untreated trees. The mean number of mines per leaf ranged from 0 to 106.54. Both insecticides contained the pest, and their persistence was indicated by the level of effectives during the second year after treatment. The number of mines on the treated plants decreased significantly, and during the last year not more than three mines per leaf were observed, as against 64 mines on the control plants. Generally the infestation was reduced by up to 82%. Most of the holes in the bark of the treated plants were healed within 6-7 months from the treatment. Only in few trees extravasation of mucilaginous exudates or cracks on the trunk occurred.

TI  - Ecology of diamondback moth in Australian canola landscape perspectives and the implications for management [electronic resource]
AB  - The ecology of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylsotella L. (Lepidoptera Plutellidae), and records of its frequent, but sporadic, population outbreaks in the canola agroecosystems of southern and western Australia are reviewed. The migratory capacity of DBM, possible maintenance of pest populations on brassicaceous weeds and forage crops, resistance to commonly used pyrethroid insecticides, a lack of effective natural enemies (due to disruption by insecticides and difficulties associated with colonising the vast areas of canola crops) and suitable climatic conditions during critical phases of the crop cycle are all likely to contribute to the observed pest outbreaks. A greater understanding of the ecology of DBM in the canola landscape is fundamental to improving its management in the crop but relevant long-term DBM abundance data are currently lacking. Five critical research issues are identified (i) improved understanding of the factors which determine regional movement patterns of diamondback in canola-growing areas; (ii) the development and implementation of flexible insecticide resistance management strategies; (iii) better understanding of canola crop colonisation by natural enemies of DBM and their population dynamics under current and alternative insecticide application strategies; (iv) greater appreciation of the interactions between DBM and its crop and weedy host plants; and (v) the development of validated simulation models to aid in the forecasting of possible DBM outbreaks. Each issue represents a significant challenge but all must be addressed if the development of a sustainable integrated strategy for the management of DBM in Australian canola is to become a reality.

TI  - Major Sex Pheromone Components of the Australian Gum Leaf Skeletonizer Uraba lugens (10E,12Z)-Hexadecadien-1-yl Acetate and (10E,12Z)-Hexadecadien-1-ol [electronic resource]
AB  - Two sex pheromone components of the gum leaf skeletonizer, Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera Nolidae), recently established in New Zealand, were identified. Gas chromatography (GC) electroantennographic detection analyses of female pheromone gland extracts gave three compounds that consistently elicited antennal responses. Chemical analyses, using GC and GC-mass spectrometry, in conjunction with 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione and dimethyldisulfide derivatizations, identified these compounds as (10E,12Z)-hexadecadien-1-yl acetate (E10,Z12-16Ac), (10E,12Z)-hexadecadien-1-ol (E10,Z12-16OH), and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-yl acetate (Z11-16Ac). A trapping trial in Queensland, Australia, in 2002, indicated that a blend of the two major components E10,Z12-16Ac and E10,Z12-16OH could attract gum leaf skeletonizer males. In the same trial, E10,Z12-16Ac alone trapped large numbers of an unidentified nolid, Nola spp. Further trials in Auckland, New Zealand established that these two components were sufficient and necessary for trap catch of males; adding minor gland components, (10E,12E)-hexadecadien-1-yl acetate (E10,E12-16Ac), Z11-16Ac, or octadecan-1-ol (18OH), to the two-component lure did not result in increased trap catches. Behavioral observations and gland analyses of the Auckland population revealed that female moths begin calling soon after emergence, with peak calling and pheromone production occurring 7 hr into the scotophase. Analysis of gland extract at two-hourly intervals during the first activity period showed that the ratio of E10,Z12-16Ac to E10,Z12-16OH (mean of 86 14, respectively) and pheromone titer were fairly constant. No qualitative or quantitative differences in pheromone components were detected between gland extracts from Tasmanian univoltine and Auckland bivoltine populations of U. lugens.

TI  - Nectar usage in a southern Arizona hawkmoth community [electronic resource]
AB  - 1. Hawkmoths (Sphingidae) are important plant associates at two life-history stages larvae are herbivorous, whereas adults are nectar feeders and often pollinators. The diversity and identities of plants used for nectar is poorly known, however. 2. This study takes a community-level approach to hawkmoth nectar plant usage in a semi-arid grassland habitat in southern Arizona, U.S.A. 3. Pollen carried on the proboscis was identified from over 700 individuals of 14 hawkmoth species attracted to lights over a 2-year period. 4. Two plant species dominated pollen loads, suggesting that hawkmoths use these species extensively as nectar sources Datura wrightii (Solanaceae), a classic hawkmoth-pollinated plant, and Agave palmeri (Agavaceae), which is known to be used extensively by bats. Field surveys indicate that both species are relatively rare in the flowering community. Little or no pollen was present on the moths from the most common plant species in flower during the study. 5. The dominance of Agave in pollen loads suggests that this typically bat-pollinated species may be subsidising pollinator populations of the hawkmoth-pollinated flora. 6. Three groups of hawkmoths within this community are identified based on larval diets (reported in the literature) and adult diets (documented here) those that, at a given site, heavily exploit the same plant species at both life-history stages (Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata); those that have broad local associations at both life-history stages (Hyles lineata); and those that exhibit narrow but non-overlapping local associations at the two life-history stages (all other hawkmoths at this site).

TI  - Temporal Dynamics of Rich Moth Ensembles in the Montane Forest Zone in Southern Ecuador [electronic resource]
AB  - We studied temporal dynamics of diverse moth ensembles (Arctiidae and Geometridae) in early and late succession stages of forest recovery in the montane zone of southern Ecuador. Moths were sampled using weak light sources (2 x 15 W tubes per trap) during three sampling periods (March-April 2002, wet season; October-November 2002, and August-October 2003, both "dry" seasons). Arctiid moth abundance hardly varied between sampling periods. Estimates of local diversity were lower in 2002 (wet and dry season) than in the dry season 2003, and ensemble composition was more strongly affected by sampling period rather than habitat differences. Geometridae ensembles revealed stronger temporal patterns. Geometrid abundance increased about twofold from the wet to the dry season, and temporal effects on species composition were far more pronounced that in arctiids. These differences might hint to variation in the dependence of geometrid versus arctiid larvae on ephemeral plant resources. Despite these significant temporal dynamics, in both families only a few of the more common species analyzed individually showed strong temporal changes in abundance. Almost all common species occurred as adults during all sampling periods. Therefore, even though temporal dynamics of moth ensembles are not negligible, both moth families are suitable "indicators" of community diversity and change along the succession gradient. Samples must be large enough, however, and preferably should be collated over various times of the year and in parallel, to allow for valid statements about moth diversity and species compositions in relation to habitat differences. These recommendations undermine the validity of the concept of "rapid biodiversity inventories" for speciose tropical insect communities.

TI  - Resistance to Selected Organochlorin, Organophosphate, Carbamate and Pyrethroid, in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) from Pakistan [electronic resource]
AB  - The toxicity of the most commonly used insecticides of organochlorine, organophosphate, pyrethroid, and carbamate groups were investigated against Spodoptera litura (F.) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) populations collected for three consecutive years (2004-2006). For a chlorocyclodiene and pyrethroids tested, the resistance ratios compared with Lab-PK were in the range of 10- to 92-fold for endosulfan, 5- to 111-fold for cypermethrin, 2- to 98-fold for deltamethrin, and 7- to 86-fold for -cyfluthrin. For organophosphates and carbamates, resistance ratios were in the range of 3- to 169-fold for profenofos, 18- to 421-fold for chlorpyrifos, 3- to 160-fold for quinalphos, 6- to 126-fold for phoxim, 7- to 463-fold for triazophos, and 10- to 389-fold for methomyl and 16- to 200-fold for thiodicarb. Resistance ratios were generally low to medium for deltamethrin and -cyfluthrin and high to very high for endosulfan, cypermethrin, profenofos, chlorpyrifos, quinalphos, phoxim, triazophos, methomyl, or thiodicarb. Pairwise comparisons of the log LC50 values of insecticides tested for all the populations showed correlations among several insecticides, suggesting a cross-resistance mechanism. Integration of timely judgment of pest problem, delimiting growing of alternate crops such as arum, rotation of insecticides with new chemicals, and insect growth regulators in relation to integrated pest management could help in manageable control of this important pest.

TI  - Plant Host Effect on the Development of Heliothis virescens F. (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - Heliothis virescens F. is an important polyphagous pest that can develop on >100 plant species, including 20 economic crops. Populations of this insect are believed to be locally maintained on a few crops and weed hosts in Washington County, MS. To find the intrinsic value of these plants for the development of H. virescens populations, we fed different laboratory and wild colonies with fresh and lyophilized plant tissue under a constant temperature. Development time of this insect under laboratory conditions varied up to 10 d between plant hosts and was dependent on the type of plant tissue provided fresh or lyophilized. Life table parameters such as net reproductive rate, finite rate of increase, and generation time indicated that Trifolium repens, a wild host growing around agricultural fields year round, could be one of the most suitable local plant hosts for the development of H. virescens. Two species of Geranium, previously reported as the source of the first H. virescens generation in the region, had lower intrinsic value as a food source than did T. repens. Gossyipium hirsutum, perhaps the most important crop source of H. virescens in the region, produced low net reproductive rate and finite rate of increase parameters. Sampling conducted in agricultural fields during 2006 and 2007 found no larvae on the above mentioned wild hosts as it was previously reported. Results indicated that H. virescens populations in this region were not supported by the wild plant species growing around agricultural fields during the time when the survey took place.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics, dispersion, sequential sampling plans and treatment thresholds for the citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), in a mature lemon block in coastal New South Wales, Australia [electronic resource]
AB  - Studies of citrus leafminer in a coastal orchard in NSW, Australia indicated that an increase in abundance to about one mine per flush was followed during the midseason flush by a rapid increase in population that was related to an increase in the percentage of leaves infested within flushes and the number of mines per leaf. The fits of frequency distributions and Iwao's patchiness regression indicated that populations were highly contagious initially, and as the exponent k of the negative binomial distribution increased with increasing population density, the distribution approached random. Concurrently, the coefficient of variation of mines per flush (which was strongly related to the proportion of un-infested flushes) decreased to about unity as the proportion of un-infested flushes reached zero and fell further as the number of mines per flush increased. Both numerative and binomial sequential sampling plans were developed using a decision threshold based on 1.2 mines per flush. The binomial sampling plan was based on a closely fitting model of the functional relationship between mean density and proportion of infested flushes. Functional relationships using the parameters determined from Iwao's patchiness regression and Taylor's power law were equally satisfactory, and one based on the negative binomial model also fitted well, but the Poisson model did not. The three best fitting models indicated that a decision threshold of 1.2 mines per flush was equivalent to 50% of flushes infested. From a practical point of view, the transition from 25% infestation of flushes through 50% is so rapid that it may be prudent to take action when the 25% level is reached; otherwise, the 50% may be passed before the crop is checked again. For valuable nursery stock should infestation be detected in spring, it may be advisable to apply prophylactic treatment as the midseason flush starts.

TI  - Evidence for field evolved resistance to newer insecticides in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) from Pakistan [electronic resource]
AB  - The toxicity of representative newer insecticides, which are being used widely in Pakistan, were investigated against various populations of Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) collected from three different districts for 3 consecutive years. For spinosad, resistance ratio compared with Lab-PK were in the range of 7-122-fold, 3-95-fold for indoxacarb, 4-186-fold for abamectin, 2-77-fold for emamectin and 13-224-fold for fipronil. The resistance ratio for insect growth regulator (IGR) tested was in the range of 2-66-fold for leufenuron, 8-56-fold for diflubenuron and 2-153-fold for methoxyfenozide. Paired wise comparisons of the log LCs of insecticides tested for all the populations showed correlations among several insecticides, suggesting a cross-resistance mechanism. The most probable reason for low toxicity of these insecticides could also be the development of multiple resistance mechanisms; however, further studies are required to establish these mechanisms. When these same products were tested against a susceptible laboratory population (Lab-PK), emamectin and indoxacarb were significantly more toxic than other compounds tested. The results are discussed in relation to integrated pest management (IPM) for the S. litura with respect to unstable resistance in the field.

TI  - Evaluation of Long-Term Mating Disruption of Ephestia kuehniella and Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in Indoor Storage Facilities by Pheromone Traps and Monitoring of Relative Aerial Concentrations of Pheromone [electronic resource]
AB  - The potential for pheromone-based mating disruption (MD) of Ephestia kuehniella (Walker) and Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) was investigated in two flour mills and a pet food distributor. Plastic sachets emitting 2-3 mg per d ( Z, E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate, the major pheromone component of both moth species, were used as MD dispensers, which were applied in grid systems resulting in one dispenser per 100 m 3 of air volume. Pheromone traps with sticky inserts were used to monitor moth population fluctuations. To monitor pheromone levels in the air before, during, and after the treatment, electroantennographic (EAG) measurements were performed using a portable device. All localities showed decreased trap catches after application of MD. In two localities with low initial population densities, trap catches were reduced immediately after application of MD and remained very low, even several months after the MD treatment was terminated. In contrast, in a locality with a higher initial population density the reduction in trap catches was slower, and trap catches increased again soon after the termination of the MD treatment. Electrophysiological data showed not only increased aerial levels of pheromone during the treatment period but also levels that were higher than during pretreatment, even 12 mo after removal of MD dispensers. The localities had good ventilation, and the memory effect observed indicates that the pheromone adhered to surfaces that subsequently functioned as secondary dispensers. Customer complaints registered by one of the mills were 49% less in 2004, after 2 yr of MD compared with 2002, the year before the treatments began.

TI  - Field Evaluations of Concentrated Spray Applications of Microencapsulated Sex Pheromone for Codling Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - The application of a microencapsulated (MEC) sex pheromone formulation (Checkmate CM-F) for codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), in low volume, concentrated sprays was evaluated in a series of small plot and grower trials in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen, and pear, Pyrus communis L. Preliminary tests found that MEC sprays applied at 172-207 kilopascals in 12-23 liters/ha deposited the highest density of microcapsules per leaf. The addition of a latex sicker did not increase the deposition of microcapsules. Small plot tests in 2004 compared the effectiveness of two low-volume sprayers against a standard high-volume spray (926 liters/ha) applied at 1,379 kilopascals. Moth catches and fruit injury were significantly lower in plots treated with the low-volume sprays compared with plots treated with the standard sprayer. These results suggest that concentrating the MEC formulation increases the deposition of microcapsules and improves its effectiveness. Larger trials were conducted with a low-volume sprayer in 4-ha plots within commercial apple (2005-2006) and pear orchards (2005) paired with similar plots treated with hand-applied pheromone dispensers. Levels of fruit injury were not significantly different between pheromone treatments in any of the three tests. Moth catches, however, were significantly higher in the MEC- versus the dispenser-treated apple plots in 2005. No difference was found in the fruit injury levels in MEC-treated apple orchards in 2005 caused by irrigation method, but moth catches were significantly higher in overhead versus undertree orchards. The advantages and current limitations of using MEC sex pheromone sprays to supplement current grower's management strategies for codling moth is discussed.

TI  - Densities of Heliothis virescens and Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in three plant hosts [electronic resource]
AB  - Large numbers of field-collected tobacco budworms Heliothis virescens L., and/or bollworms Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (heliothines) might be difficult to obtain depending upon host plants available to the insects. Of the >95 cultivated and wild plants that have been identified as their hosts, some are highly attractive to these insects, some are also widely available and of those, some could be used to collect large numbers of both insect species. However, the reliability of these plants in space and time in providing abundant samples of larvae and/or moths is not well understood. We studied naturally-occurring heliothine populations over a 3-year period in 2 different geographic locations in plots of garbanzo bean (Cicer arietinum L.), upland cotton (Gossipium hirsutum L.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medikus) finding that garbanzo bean produced significantly higher numbers of tobacco budworm and bollworm larvae and adults as compared to the other 2 plant species. Tobacco budworm larvae were found in at least 1 host plant (primarily garbanzo) all the years in both locations while bollworm larvae were not. Field moth emergence represented < or = 10% of its larval densities and abiotic factors made a difference on moth emergence between years. When large numbers of both insects are needed for field or laboratory studies, garbanzo bean offers a clear advantage over cotton or velvetleaf to obtain collections of heliothines.

TI  - Monitoring Populations of Saddled Prominent (Lepidoptera Notodontidae) with Pheromone-Baited Traps [electronic resource]
AB  - Field trials with three types of pheromone traps were performed in eight northern hardwood stands in northern New York state to develop a population-monitoring tool for the saddled prominent, Heterocampa guttivitta (Walker) (Lepidoptera Notodontidae). Lure specificity and the relationship between pheromone trap catch and subsequent egg density were examined. A study of moth emergence in relation to temperature was designed to determine whether moth activity throughout the flight season can be predicted using a growing degree-day (DD) model. Pherocon 1C wing traps were significantly more effective than the green Unitrap bucket style. Catch was not affected by position when traps were > or = 20 m from an opening (road), and lures were specific to saddled prominent. Lure specificity was examined using green Multipher bucket traps, which effectively attracted and held moths. In the first year of the study, number of viable eggs per 10 leaf clusters was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.59) with average moth catch/trap in pheromone-baited Pherocon traps. When differences in stand density (basal area) and relative abundance of sugar maple (percentage of total stems per hectare), the principle host, were accounted for, the multiple regression model also was significant and r2 = 0. 83. Neither model, however, was significant the second year. Using a base temperature of 5.5'C and on-site temperature data, the peak of moth flight occurred at 316 8 DD and end of flight occurred at 533 9 DD.

TI  - Changes in distribution of an archaic moth, Micropterix calthella, in St Petersburg, Russia, between 1989 and 2005 [electronic resource]
AB  - This work aimed to assess changes in the number of suitable habitats and habitat occupancy by Micropterix calthella (L.) moths (Lepidoptera, Micropterigidae) in the city of St Petersburg between 1989 and 2005. The city of St Petersburg, Russia. The study compares results of the survey conducted on 9-12 June 2005 with data collected in 1989 and is based on the assessment of the quality and occupancy of 103 habitats that were found potentially suitable for M. calthella in 1989. If habitats contained wet microsites with undisturbed litter and dense field layer vegetation with a high abundance of flowering Ranunculus sp., they were considered potentially suitable for M. calthella; in these habitats, moths were searched for on flowers of Ranunculus- visually and/or by extensive sweep-netting. Both the number of habitats suitable for M. calthella and the number of habitats occupied by this species decreased since 1986 from 103 to 72 and from 58 to 34, respectively. The disappearance of habitats was primarily due to the building of residential blocks within the city (16 sites) and railway renovation (10 sites), while changes in habitat management, primarily in parks and recreation zones (five sites), were less important. The average distance from the city centre to the nearest population of M. calthella increased from 8.7 1.5 to 12.9 3.0 km (mean SE). The data for 2005 fit the prediction that M. calthella moths, which are unable to re-colonize potentially suitable habitats due to their low migratory ability, will disappear from the city. At the present rate of extinction, this process may take some 20-30 years to complete (or nearly complete).

TI  - Does immune function influence population fluctuations and level of parasitism in the cyclic geometrid moth [electronic resource]?
AB  - Populations of the autumnal moth, Epirrita autumnata, exhibit cycles with high amplitudes in northernmost Europe, culminating in devastating outbreak densities at favourable sites. Parasitism by hymenopteran parasitoids has been hypothesised to operate with a delayed density dependence capable of producing the observed dynamics. It has also been hypothesised that insects in crowded conditions invest greatly in their immunity as a counter-measure to increased risk of parasitism and pathogen infections. Furthermore, inducible plant defences consequent to grazing by herbivorous insects may be linked to the performance of parasitoids and pathogens through increased immunocompetence of the herbivore feeding on the foliage, in which the defence induction has taken place. At ten sampling sites, we quantified larval abundance, outbreak status and percentage larval parasitism during an extended peak phase of a population cycle. These population level covariates, together with an individual pupal mass, were used to explain differences in the immune defence, measured as an encapsulation reaction to artificial antigen. We also conducted a field study for an investigation of the susceptibility of autumnal moth pupae to naturally occurring pupal parasitoids. We did not find obvious differences between the encapsulation rate of autumnal moths originating from the sites with different past and current larval densities and risks for parasitism. The best ranked statistical models included pupal mass and outbreak status as explanatory variables, although both showed only slight effects on the encapsulation rate. The host resistance test revealed positive relationships between the encapsulation rate, body size and percentage parasitism of the exposed pupae, indicating that pupal parasitoids chose, and/or survived better, in large host individuals irrespective of their encapsulation ability. Thus, our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that variation in the immune function drives or modulates population cycles of autumnal moths.

TI  - Can life-history and defence traits predict the population dynamics and natural enemy responses of insect herbivores [electronic resource]?
AB  - 1. Life-history differences between herbivorous insects with eruptive and latent population dynamics are potentially useful for predicting population size variability. An association has also been demonstrated between herbivorous insect defence traits and the responses of various natural enemies. 2. Here predictions of population dynamics and natural enemy responses based on life-history and defence traits are tested using Gonometa postica Walker and G. rufobrunnea Aurivillius, two Southern Hemisphere Macrolepidoptera (Lasiocampidae) species. The temporal and spatial variation in pupal abundance and patterns of pupal parasitism and predation for both species are described and quantified for the first time. 3. Eleven sites were sampled over four generations across the region where both species have historically reached high population densities. Although there was evidence suggesting that population synchrony is driven by weather patterns, site-specific environmental differences contributed to the observed population variability. This study is the first to quantify the extent of population size variability of a species with an intermediate position on the eruptive-latent population dynamic gradient, where data on insect population dynamics is scarce. 4. Support for the life-history-population dynamic relationship was found, as intermediate population size variability for these species was observed. Larval and pupal defence traits, however, were poor and inconsistent predictors of mortality rate. Pupal cocoon structure differences, previously documented for these Gonometa species, may in fact explain the interspecific differences in natural enemy responses found. 5. Predicted population dynamics and natural enemy responses may, however, be overridden by ecological conditions. Nevertheless, life-history and defence traits provide a useful basis for predicting population dynamics of poorly studied species.

TI  - An Endemic Population of Western Poplar Clearwing Moths (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) Invades a Monoculture of Hybrid Poplar [electronic resource]
AB  - Western poplar clearwing, Paranthrene robiniae (Hy. Edwards) (Lepidoptera Sesiidae), is endemic in Pacific Northwest riparian habitats at low population densities. These moths have colonized commercial hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) plantings. Moth populations increased rapidly and became a major pest. Trap catches of male moths in mid-season surveys increased 190-fold from 95 in 2001 to >18,500 in 2002 across 6,597 ha of poplars monitored. The outbreak of western poplar clearwings was widespread in 2002. Pheromone-baited traps placed one trap per 81.75 ha over 13,274 ha of commercial poplars captured >108,000 male moths in 2002. Damage to commercial poplars included girdling of saplings and burrows in limbs and trunks of trees. Repeated applications of chlorpyrifos failed to reduce the abundance of moths in 2002. Two management strategies over two separate plantations of approximately equal to 6,500 ha each were contrasted. Future control strategies recommend a halt to the use of contact insecticides that target adult moths. Short-term (3-5 yr) control should involve a pheromone-based mating disruption strategy followed eventually by selection of a clone that is less susceptible to P. robiniae attack.

TI  - Effects of Orchard Host Plants (Apple and Peach) on Development of Oriental Fruit Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - Studies were designed to examine the effects of host plants (apple, Malus domestica Borkh., and peach, Prunus persica L.) on the development of oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae). Oriental fruit moth larvae developed faster on peach than on apple, both on fruit as well as on growing terminal shoots. On fruit, these differences were shown to cause significant changes in both the rate (approximately equal to 20-60 degree-days earlier emergence on peach than on apple) and patterns of adult emergence among several cultivars of peaches and apples. Slopes of female emergence plots varied by host in 2003, with emergence occurring over a longer period on peach cultivars than on apple cultivars (with one exception). Slopes of male emergence curves did not differ by cultivar in 2003. These host-driven effects could impact the efficacy of traditional pest management approaches and probably complicate efforts to predictively model G. molesta populations in mixed cultivar orchards. Such developmental effects may help to explain previously observed differences in patterns of pheromone trap captures in peach versus apple orchards. Host-associated effects should be incorporated into future models to develop more realistic predictive tools and thus improve integrated pest management efforts.

TI  - Diel Periodicity of Emergence and Premating Reproductive Behaviors of Adult Dogwood Borer (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - The emergence and premating reproductive behaviors of adult dogwood borer moths, Synanthedon scitula Harris (Lepidoptera Sesiidae), were examined under controlled conditions in the laboratory and in apple orchards in Virginia. The diel periodicity of male response to pheromone sources was recorded using traps baited with commercial pheromone lures and with a recently identified, trinary blend of dogwood borer sex pheromone components. An earlier study reporting a significant effect of pheromone trap height on the capture of male dogwood borer was revisited, using commercial lures and the new pheromone. Under a 168 (LD)-h photo regimen, the emergence of male and female moths showed a diel periodicity, peaking at 0600 hours. Sexual receptivity of female moths, indicated by the onset of calling behavior, occurred in most individuals on the day after emergence and was observed only during the crepuscular period just before and after sunset. Similarly, the capture of male dogwood borer in traps deployed in July and baited with virgin female moths or pheromone lures coincided with the period of female calling behavior, peaking sharply between 2000 and 2100 hours. When pheromone-baited traps were deployed in September, the peak capture of male dogwood borer occurred earlier, between 1900 and 2000 hours. Traps baited with a commercial lure captured significantly more male dogwood borer at 1.8 m (6 ft), whereas those baited with the trinary dogwood borer sex pheromone captured similar numbers of males at elevations ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 m (4-8 ft). Use of the new dogwood borer sex pheromone has tremendously increased the precision of trapping data and has yielded reliable measurements of the behavior and abundance of male moths that pertain directly to improved monitoring and management capabilities.

TI  - The introduction and release of Chiasmia inconspicua and C. assimilis (Lepidoptera Geometridae) for the biological control of Acacia nilotica in Australia [electronic resource]
AB  - Two geometrid moths Chiasmia inconspicua and Chiasmia assimilis, identified as potential biological control agents for prickly acacia Acacia nilotica subsp. indica, were collected in Kenya and imported into quarantine facilities in Australia where laboratory cultures were established. Aspects of the biologies of both insects were studied and CLIMEX' models indicating the climatically favourable areas of Australia were developed. Host range tests were conducted using an approved test list of 74 plant species and no-choice tests of neonate larvae placed on both cut foliage and potted plants. C. inconspicua developed through to adult on prickly acacia and, in small numbers, Acacia pulchella. C. assimilis developed through to adult on prickly acacia and also in very small numbers on A. pulchella, A. deanei, A. decurrens, and A. mearnsii. In all experiments, the response on prickly acacia could be clearly differentiated from the responses on the non-target species. Both insects were approved for release in Australia. Over a three-year period releases were made at multiple sites in north Queensland, almost all in inland areas. There was no evidence of either insect's establishment and both colonies were terminated. A new colony of C. assimilis was subsequently established from insects collected in South Africa and releases of C. assimilis from this new colony were made into coastal and inland infestations of prickly acacia. Establishment was rapid at one coastal site and the insect quickly spread to other infestations. Establishment at one inland area was also confirmed in early 2006. The establishment in coastal areas supported a CLIMEX model that indicated that the climate of coastal areas was more suitable than inland areas.

TI  - The influence of the atmospheric boundary layer on nocturnal layers of noctuids and other moths migrating over southern Britain [electronic resource]
AB  - Insects migrating at high altitude over southern Britain have been continuously monitored by automatically operating, vertical-looking radars over a period of several years. During some occasions in the summer months, the migrants were observed to form well-defined layer concentrations, typically at heights of 200-400 m, in the stable night-time atmosphere. Under these conditions, insects are likely to have control over their vertical movements and are selecting flight heights that are favourable for long-range migration. We therefore investigated the factors influencing the formation of these insect layers by comparing radar measurements of the vertical distribution of insect density with meteorological profiles generated by the UK Meteorological Office's (UKMO) Unified Model (UM). Radar-derived measurements of mass and displacement speed, along with data from Rothamsted Insect Survey light traps, provided information on the identity of the migrants. We present here three case studies where noctuid and pyralid moths contributed substantially to the observed layers. The major meteorological factors influencing the layer concentrations appeared to be (a) the altitude of the warmest air, (b) heights corresponding to temperature preferences or thresholds for sustained migration and, (c) on nights when air temperatures are relatively high, wind-speed maxima associated with the nocturnal jet. Back-trajectories indicated that layer duration may have been determined by the distance to the coast. Overall, the unique combination of meteorological data from the UM and insect data from entomological radar described here show considerable promise for systematic studies of high-altitude insect layering.

TI  - Phenology of Plumeria alba and its Herbivores in a Tropical Dry Forest [electronic resource]
AB  - Understanding phenology in plant populations requires distinction between proximate mechanisms and ultimate (evolutionary) causation. Leaf production and abscission, flower production, and herbivory were monitored for 2 yr in a population of the stem succulent tree, Plumeria alba L. in the Gunica State Forest in southwest Puerto Rico. Dependence of phenological events on abiotic (rainfall and day length) and biotic factors (herbivore abundance/damage) was quantified to discern potential relationships. Leaf flush and flowering were not associated with periods of highest rainfall as might be expected in a dry tropical forest. Rather, these events were highly correlated with day length. We observed that most leaf flush began in March and April, which was several months before the wettest period of the year (August to November). This result is consistent with other studies that show that leaf flush in Plumeria is under photoperiodic control and that the plants initiate growth and reproduction when cloudiness is low and seasonal light availability is greatest. Herbivore damage by caterpillars of the sphinx moth Pseudosphinx tetrio is restricted primarily to the wettest season, consistent with the hypothesis that early leaf flush and reproduction has been selected to avoid herbivory. It is not clear whether photoperiodic control of leaf flush and reproduction serves to maximize seasonal light availability, minimize the impact of herbivores, or both. However, it is clear that peak rainfall is not likely to have been the sole selective factor determining leaf flush and flowering in P. alba.

TI  - Influence of Within-Orchard Trap Placement on Catch of Codling Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in Sex Pheromone-Treated Orchards [electronic resource]
AB  - The influence of trap placement on catches of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., was examined in a series of studies conducted in orchards treated with Isomate-C Plus sex pheromone dispensers. Mark-recapture tests with sterilized moths released along the interface of pairs of treated and untreated apple and pear plots found that significantly more male but not female moths were recaptured on interception traps placed in the treated plots. In a second test, significantly higher numbers of wild male and female moths were caught on interception traps placed in treated versus untreated plots within a heavily infested orchard. The highest numbers of male moths were caught on traps placed along the interior edge of the treated plots. Trap position had no influence on the captures of female moths. In a third test, north-south transects of sex pheromone-baited traps were placed through adjacent treated and untreated plots that received a uniform release of sterilized moths. Traps on the upwind edge of the treated plots caught similar numbers of moths as traps upwind from the treated plots. Moth catch was significantly reduced at all other locations inside versus outside of the treated plots, including traps placed on the downwind edge of the treated plot. In a fourth test, five apple orchards were monitored with groups of sex pheromone-baited traps placed either on the border or at three distances inside the orchards. The highest moth counts were in traps placed at the border, and the lowest moth counts were in traps placed 30 and 50 m from the border. In a fifth test, the proportion of traps failing to catch any moths despite the occurrence of local fruit injury was significantly higher in traps placed 50 versus 25 m from the border. The implications provided by these data for designing an effective monitoring program for codling moth in sex pheromone-treated orchards are discussed.

TI  - Higher Densities of Distributed Pheromone Sources Provide Disruption of Codling Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) Superior to That of Lower Densities of Clumped Sources [electronic resource]
AB  - Field experiments quantified the effect of synthetic pheromone release-site density and distribution on 1) orientational disruption of male codling moths, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), to pheromone-baited traps; and 2) fruit injury. A clustering test varied pheromone release-site density from 0 to 1,000 Isomate-C Plus dispensers per ha while maintaining the total number of dispensers at 1,000. Percentage of orientational disruption of pheromone-baited traps increased significantly as a function of increasing density of release sites. Fruit injury decreased as the density of release sites increased and was lowest in plots treated with Isomate-C Plus dispensers distributed as 1,000 point sources per ha. We also manipulated point source density of 0.1-ml paraffin-wax drops containing 5% codlemone [(E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol], and thus the total amount of pheromone deployed per hectare. The percentage of disruption of traps baited with either 1.0- or 0.1-mg codlemone lures increased with increasing density of wax drops deployed. Both trapping and field observations confirmed that wax drops were attractive to male codling moths, suggesting that disruption was mediated by competitive attraction. Development of dispensers that can be mechanically applied at high densities has potential to improve the efficacy and economics of codling moth disruption at high population densities.

TI  - Describing seasonal phenology of the leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) with pheromone lures controlling for lure degradation [electronic resource]
AB  - Traps baited with pheromone lures were deployed in a Florida citrus grove at various dates over the course of 1 year to describe the seasonal flight phenology of the leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton. To compensate for lure degradation, a correction factor was applied based on a regression model of relative lure efficiency, expressed as a percent of the catch of a freshly deployed lure as a function of the number of days each set of lures was deployed. The regression of percent trap catch vs. number of days deployed yielded a quadratic expression that predicts 50% loss of lure attractiveness at 50 d after lure deployment and 90% loss at 137 d. The data transformed for lure degradation revealed 4 apparent population density peaks including 2 minor peaks with highest mean trap catch in early Apr and late Oct, and 2 major peaks with highest mean trap catch on 31 May and 1 Aug. A very small number of moths were collected on control traps without a lure. However, the pattern of trap catch on unbaited sticky cards closely paralleled that of the pheromone-baited traps.

TI  - Effects of Orchard Host Plants on the Oviposition Preference of the Oriental Fruit Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - Recently, the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), has emerged as a major problem on apples (Malus spp.) grown in the mid-Atlantic and midwestern United States, despite its historically important and frequent occurrence as a peach (Prunus spp.) pest. It is possible that host-driven biological phenomena may be contributing to changes in G. molesta population dynamics resulting in outbreaks in apple. Studies were designed to examine the effects of host plants on oviposition behavior, in an effort to clarify the host association status of eastern U.S. populations and also to gain insight into how pest modeling and management efforts may be altered to take into account various host-associated effects. G. molesta adults exhibited ovipositional preference for nonbearing peach trees over nonbearing apple trees in close-range choice tests conducted in the field, regardless of the larval host origin. A significant preference for peach shoots over apple shoots was observed on six of 12 sampling dates with a wild G. molesta population at the interface of adjacent peach and apple blocks. Numbers of eggs found on apple fruit were higher after peach fruit were harvested and apple fruit began to approach maturity (during the flight period for third and fourth brood adults). Possible implications for population modeling and integrated management of G. molesta are discussed.

TI  - Sesiid Moths Reduce Germination, Seedling Growth, and Survivorship in Pentaclethra macroloba (Mimosoideae), a Locally Dominant Lowland Neotropical Tree [electronic resource]
AB  - Monodominant forests are a widespread feature of the humid and wet lowland tropics, but little is known about their origins or factors mediating their persistence. Nonetheless, escape from significant vertebrate and invertebrate seed predation plays a prominent role in most hypotheses. The seeds of Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae Mimosoideae) have long been thought to be virtually immune to predation, contributing to its local dominance in the canopy of some Mesoamerican forests. Here, we describe herbivory by the larvae of Carmenta surinamensis (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) on the seeds of P. macroloba, and report the results of studies designed to clarify how this interaction influences germination, seedling growth, and mortality. To this end, we collected P. macroloba seeds at 30-d intervals for 5 mo along a rain forest transect in Costa Rica. The seeds were monitored in a shade house for 30 d. Adult moths were reared from 43.6 percent of seeds, and significantly affected germination and mortality, and all measures of growth (number of leaves, seedling height, seed and seedling mass at 30 d, and 30-d change in seed and seedling mass). Based on these observations, we conclude that seed boring by C. surinamensis is a potentially important factor influencing population dynamics in P. macroloba, and warrants further investigation for its prospective role in regulating local abundance in this locally dominant and ecologically significant tree.

TI  - Use of Geostatistical Analysis to Characterize the Spatial Distribution of Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) Larvae in Northern Greece [electronic resource]
AB  - Gaining a better understanding of the spatial variation of pests is a key to their more effective mapping to improve our knowledge of their overall population dynamics and optimize our control strategies. Geostatistical methods were used in this study to characterize spatial variability in Lobesia botrana Denis and Schiffermller (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) larval infestation, injury, and damage patterns in six locations over 2 yr. Regression was used to detect and separate macroscale trends from the microscale variation. The presence of macroscale variation indicated a significant edge effect with insect population moving into vineyards and ovipositing mainly along the field edges. Similarities in the patterns of spatial variability occur between the second and third generations and also between infestation, injury, and damage in all fields. The microscale variation was studied using semivariograms for all fields. Semivariograms strongly indicate that the spatial structures of L. botrana larvae were aggregated with dependency down a row of vineyards differing from that across rows of the crop, leading to anisotropy. The average range across the vine rows was consistently shorter than along rows, suggesting that migration occurs more easily down rows than across them. The anisotropic analysis further indicates that sampling programs can deploy sample locations at greater distances along the rows than across them, and interpolation algorithms that use this information may produce better map estimates. These results have implications for developing sampling plans for management of L. botrana and for site-specific agriculture.

TI  - Adjusting the Phenology Model of Codling Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in Washington State Apple Orchards [electronic resource]
AB  - Studies were conducted with codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., to fit cumulative curves for the occurrence of injured fruits and male moth catches in sex pheromone-baited traps as a function of accumulated degree-days after the start of moth flight. Twelve data sets were collected from seven apple, Malus domestica Bordhausen, orchards in Washington State from 2003 to 2006. Cumulative data were grouped across years for orchards either treated with sex pheromone dispensers or untreated and fit to logistic equations for both the first and second generation. No significant differences were found for the cumulative curves of moth flight or egg hatch between pheromone-treated and untreated orchards; thus, these data were combined. These new logistic models for moth flight and egg hatch were compared with a widely used distributed-delay model originally developed in Michigan. The cumulative flight curves for the logistic and distributed-delay models were statistically different (slopes) for the first but not the second generation. Cumulative egg hatch in the logistic model was significantly different from the distributed-delay model (intercepts and slopes) for both generations. Most strikingly, the timing of 50% egg hatch during the first generation was delayed 100 DD in the logistic model. The potential impact of this change in the characterization of codling moth's phenology on the effectiveness of insecticide programs targeting eggs and newly eclosed larvae was examined. Possible explanations for this significant difference between the models are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to record and compare the occurrence of adults and immature stages of honeydew moth, Cryptoblabes gnidiella (Milliere), related with grape phenology in two Pinot Noir (Vitis vinifera) vineyards in Bento Gonc'alves (29'10'S 51'32'O), RS, during 2004-2005. Fortnightly, immature stages were monitored in the clusters and grapevine branches, while the adults, in delta traps baited with synthetic sex pheromone. There were significant differences in the number of individuals in different phenologic stages of vineyards. The highest catches of honeydew moth were registered in the period of dry clusters. The permanence of dry cluster after harvest, could serve as refuge for C. gnidiella immatures between seasons.

TI  - Factors favouring the development and maintenance of outbreaks in an invasive leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) a life table study [electronic resource]
AB  - 1 Life tables were constructed for seven generations of the invasive horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella in Switzerland, to assess the factors allowing the moth to build and maintain outbreak densities and to identify 'gaps' among their mortality factors that could be targeted by new control methods. The fecundity of females was calculated and the mortality factors affecting all developmental stages determined. 2 Females contained 106.6 eggs. In captivity, the mean number of eggs laid per female varied between 34 and 82 eggs, with a maximum of 184 eggs. Egg mortality was 18-75% and was mostly due to unknown factors. 3 The main mortality factors affecting larvae and pupae in the leaves were predation by birds and arthropods in all generation and leaf senescence in the autumn generation. Parasitoids killed less than 5% of the population. 4 Nearly 90% of overwintering pupae died in dead leaves, the majority of them being killed by earthworms and other leaf decomposers. As a result, the overwintering generations were the only ones showing a net rate of increase less than one. Non-overwintering generations had net rates of increase between four and 11, allowing populations to build up from spring to autumn. 5 The persistence of high outbreak densities in Europe is explained by a combination of at least three factors (i) high fecundity; (ii) multivoltinism; (iii) the unusually low impact of traditional natural enemies of leaf miners and particularly parasitoids. 6 Yearly variations in population densities could be at least partly explained by differences in larval mortality due to leaf senescence and intraspecific competition in the last generation in autumn.

TI  - Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera Nolidae) in New Zealand pheromone trapping for delimitation and phenology
AB  - A synthetic sex pheromone trapping survey of the leaf skeletonizer Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera Nolidae) demonstrated the unexpectedly widespread distribution of the insect across >40,000 ha of urban Auckland, New Zealand. A survey of eucalyptus trees planted in parks and other public areas showed a significant spatial correlation between trap catch and breeding populations, validating the trap survey results. Traps in trees showing damage had four-fold higher catches than traps placed in undamaged or nonhost trees, and <1% of damaged trees with traps failed to catch adult moths. Damage by larval feeding was correlated with male trap catch in the previous generation, offering good prospects for a pest management decision support system, provided that an economic threshold is developed. Catches increased by 3.4-fold in the same georeferenced trapping grid between November and December 2003 and between March and April 2004 across two generations, over the summer. A vertical transect showed that catches increased with height up to the top trap at 13 m (60% of mean tree height). Options for managing the insect will need to overcome the high rate of increase, the rate of spread, and the vertical distribution of the insect on tall eucalyptus trees.

TI  - Seasonal and Cultivar-Associated Variation in Oviposition Preference of Oriental Fruit Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) Adults and Feeding Behavior of Neonate Larvae in Apples [electronic resource]
AB  - The Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) has become a pest of tree fruits since its introduction to the United States in the early twentieth century. Oriental fruit moth has historically been a major pest problem in peach production, and outbreaks in commercial apple (Malus spp.) orchards in the eastern United States were rare until the late 1990s. Recent outbreaks in Mid-Atlantic apple orchards have lead researchers to investigate host-associated effects on oriental fruit moth biology, behavior, and population dynamics. Studies were designed to assess cultivar level effects in apples on oviposition and larval feeding behavior of oriental fruit moth. In a mixed cultivar apple orchard, total oriental fruit moth oviposition and oviposition site preferences varied between cultivars. These preferences also varied over time, when sampling was repeated at various times of the growing season. Although most adult female oriental fruit moth preferentially oviposited in the calyx and stem areas of apple fruit, noticeable numbers of eggs also were laid on the sides of fruit, contradicting some previous reports. Oriental fruit moth females exhibited a strong ovipositional preference for fruit that were previously damaged by oriental fruit moth or codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). The majority of newly hatched oriental fruit moth larvae were observed to spend <24 h on the surface of apple fruit before entry, and this behavior was observed on several apple cultivars. Neonate larvae exhibited a preference for entering fruit at either the stem or calyx ends, regardless of their initial site of placement. Our findings underscore the importance of adequate spray coverage and accurate timing of insecticide applications targeting oriental fruit moth.

TI  - Monitoring of diamondback moth (Lepidoptera Plutellidae) resistance to spinosad, indoxacarb, and emamectin benzoate
AB  - Six to nine populations of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), were collected annually from fields of crucifer vegetables in the United States and Mexico from 2001 to 2004 for baseline susceptibility tests and resistance monitoring to spinosad, indoxacarb, and emamectin benzoate. A discriminating concentration for resistance monitoring to indoxacarb and emamectin benzoate was determined based on baseline data in 2001 and was used in the diagnostic assay for each population in 2002-2004 together with a discriminating concentration for spinosad determined previously. Most populations were susceptible to all three insecticides, but a population from Hawaii in 2003 showed high levels of resistance to indoxacarb. Instances of resistance to spinosad occurred in Hawaii (2000), Georgia (2001), and California (2002) as a consequence of a few years of extensive applications in each region. The collaborative monitoring program between university and industry scientists we discuss in this article has provided useful information to both parties as well as growers who use the products. These studies provide a baseline for developing a more effective resistance management program for diamondback moth.

TI  - Wallace's line revisited has vicariance or dispersal shaped the distribution of Malesian hawkmoths (Lepidoptera Sphingidae) [electronic resource]?
AB  - Large-scale biogeographical patterns of Sphingidae in the Malesian archipelago are investigated, using Geographic Information System-supported estimates of species ranges determined from a compilation of specimen-label databases. Distribution maps for all species and checklists for 114 islands are presented at http//www.sphingidae-sea.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de. Phenetic analyses of island faunas reveal 'textbook'-like patterns of biogeographical associations in the region, with Wallace's line emerging as the main faunal discontinuity in the region. Further analyses, using partial Mantel statistics, indicate that historical features of geography (such as land bridges formed during periods of lower sea levels) are an important determinant of faunal similarity, but recent dispersal can also explain a significant portion of present day hawkmoth distributions. Faunal turnover in relation to distance between islands is steeper for Smerinthinae than for other subfamilies, indicating different dispersal abilities among higher taxonomic groups. These differences are discussed in the light of life-history differences between the subfamilies.

TI  - Assessing moth migration and population structuring in Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) at the regional scale example from the Darling Downs, Australia
AB  - Analysis of gene flow and migration of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) in a major cropping region of Australia identified substantial genetic structuring, migration events, and significant population genotype changes over the 38-mo sample period from November 1999 to January 2003. Five highly variable microsatellite markers were used to analyze 916 individuals from 77 collections across 10 localities in the Darling Downs. The molecular data indicate that in some years (e.g., April 2002-March 2003), low levels of H. armigera migration and high differentiation between populations occurred, whereas in other years (e.g., April 2001-March 2002), there were higher levels of adult moth movement resulting in little local structuring of populations. Analysis of populations in other Australian cropping regions provided insight into the quantity and direction of immigration of H. armigera adults into the Darling Downs growing region of Australia. These data provide evidence adult moth movement differs from season to season, highlighting the importance of studies in groups such as the Lepidoptera extending over consecutive years, because short-term sampling may be misleading when population dynamics and migration change so significantly. This research demonstrates the importance of maintaining a coordinated insecticide resistance management strategy, because in some years H. armigera populations may be independent within a region and thus significantly influenced by local management practices; however, periods with high migration will occur and resistance may rapidly spread.

TI  - Phenology and field biology of black cutworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in Ontario no-till corn
AB  - Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), is an occasional corn, Zea mays L., pest that is attracted to no-till fields. Understanding the phenology of black cutworm in Ontario no-till corn, particularly the time of arrival of adults in relation to the onset of crop damage and the stages of larvae that coincide with vulnerable corn seedling leaf stages, is important for their effective control. Pheromone and blacklight trap captures of moths first occurred in early April, whereas significant influxes did not occur until mid- to late April. Males and females were often captured simultaneously, in contrast to findings in Iowa and Illinois where males were captured in pheromone traps on average 3 wk ahead of females or males in blacklight traps. This may be a reflection of a more mature source population for the influxes into Ontario because first captures also were later than in the United States. Females arrived mated and corn seedling cutting occurred within 137 degree-days (DD) (base 10.4 degrees C) of first capture in Ontario corn. Cutworms were present in cornfields before planting, and the mean age of larvae increased along with corn leaf stage, suggesting that no new recruitment took place after planting. The apparent synchrony between corn and cutworm phenology in the northern areas of corn production seems more related to the availability and quality of food for young larvae relative to the development of the crop then the time of arrival of moths.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of potato tuberworm (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) infestation in field-stored potatoes
AB  - The potato tuberworm, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller), is a major pest of potatoes in fields and traditional storage. A common method of nonrefrigerated storage is to pile potatoes in straw-covered heaps in the field. Tubers may be stored up to 3-4 mo in this manner, until the next harvest. We studied the dynamics of potato tuber moth infestation associated with such field storage in a 12-wk experiment in Israel. We set up six potato heaps, and sampled them for potato tuber moth at different locations at weekly intervals. Potato tuber moth infestation was significantly higher at the perimeter of the heaps than at their center, but it did not differ between bottom, mid-height, and top of the heaps. The proportion of potato tuber moth-infested potato tubers increased from 10 to 65% over the course of the experiment, and the mean number of potato tuber moth larvae per tuber increased from 0.25 to 2.50. Potato tuberworm populations increased sharply after 3, 6, and 9 wk of study, possibly corresponding to successive generations that developed within the heaps. This interpretation is supported by calculations of potato tuberworm generation length based on temperature data. Catches in pheromone traps that were placed near the heaps were not correlated (spatially and temporally) with potato tuberworm densities within heaps, hinting that migration among heaps did not considerably affect within-heap population dynamics. Potato tuberworm levels were not correlated with ambient temperatures, perhaps because of the warm, humid, and constant microclimate within the heaps. We discuss the significance of our findings for control efforts of the potato tuberworm.

TI  - Factors affecting the differential capture of male and female codling moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in traps baited with ethyl (E,Z) -2,4-decadienoate. [electronic resource]
AB  - Studies were conducted in apple to evaluate factors that differentially affect the catch of male and female codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., in traps baited with ethyl (E, Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester). We examined the time of moth capture in the diel cycle and the recapture rates of marked moths in sex pheromone mating disruption (MD) and untreated orchards. The attractiveness of pear ester-baited traps was compared among five apple cultivars. Experiments also assessed the influence of trap height, the distance of the trap from sex pheromone dispensers, proximity of foliage surrounding the trap, trap size, and proximity of adjacent clean and codling moth-injured fruit on moth captures. The responses of male and female moths significantly differed in response to many of these factors. For example, the time of peak female capture occurred earlier than for males. A higher proportion of recaptured, marked moths were females in MD versus untreated orchard plots. Significantly more male but not female moths were caught in traps placed high versus low in the tree canopy. Traps placed on the perimeter of the canopy caught significantly more female moths than traps placed within the canopy and surrounded by foliage. Smaller trap surfaces caught significantly more males than females. Traps placed adjacent to uninjured fruit caught significantly more females than traps placed away from fruit. No differences occurred between sexes in response to other factors significantly higher counts of both sexes occurred in blocks of 'Granny Smith' versus four other apple cultivars; recapture rates of marked moths were not different at release points ranging from 10 to 50 m for either sex; and trap placement relative to MD dispensers or injured versus uninjured fruits was not a significant factor affecting moth catches or their sex ratio. Effective monitoring for either or both sexes of codling moth should consider standardizing these factors. Lure and kill strategies should include factors that optimize the captures of female moths.

TI  - Understorey versus canopy patterns of vertical stratification and diversity among Lepidoptera in a Bornean rain forest
AB  - We studied the vertical distribution of Lepidoptera from a canopy walkway within a dipterocarp rain forest at Kinabalu Park (Borneo) using three different methods (1) Bait traps to survey fruit-feeding nymphalid butterflies, (2) standardized counts for predominantly flower-visiting butterflies and their potential predators, aerial-hawking birds, and (3) attraction by blacklight for hawk- and tiger moths. There was a distinct decrease in the abundance of fruit-feeding nymphalids towards the canopy, probably due to a reduced and less predictable availability of rotting fruits in higher strata. These constraints might also be responsible for a higher abundance variation in the canopy, and a significant shift in size from larger species in the understorey to smaller ones in the canopy. Changes of microclimate and the conspicuous increase of insectivorous aerial-hawking birds from ground to canopy layer may be responsible for the prominent change in species composition of fruit-feeding nymphalids between 20 and 30 m. Nectar-feeding Lepidoptera showed a reversed abundance pattern. One main factor contributing to the much higher abundance of flower-visiting butterflies and moth taxa in the canopy, such as Sphingidae and some Arctiinae, might be the increase of nectar resources available in upper vegetation layers. A distinctly higher diversity in hawkmoths was also found in the canopy. A higher abundance of insectivorous aerial-hawking birds in the canopy might contribute to the shift in body design of fruit-feeding nymphalids from more slender bodies at lower vegetation layers to stouter ones (i.e. species which are stronger on the wing) in the canopy. Larval resources could play an additional role in specialisation on but a small part of the vertical gradient. This may explain stratification pattern of the nymphalid subfamilies Morphinae and Satyrinae. Monocotyledoneous larval food plants of both taxa, whose flight activity is largely restricted to the understorey, occur mostly in lower vegetation layers. Our observations on a wide taxonomic and ecological range of butterflies and moths indicate that tropical forest canopies hold a distinct and unique Lepidoptera fauna, whose species richness and abundance patterns differ from lower strata. However, the notion of tropical forest canopies as peaks of terrestrial diversity does not hold uniformly for all taxa or guilds.

TI  - Dose-response of codling moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) to ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate in apple orchards treated with sex pheromone dispensers. [electronic resource]
AB  - Studies were conducted in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen, orchards to evaluate the attractiveness of the kairomone, ethyl (E, Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester), loaded at various rates into gray halobutyl septa, to adult codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. All studies were conducted in orchards treated with sex pheromone mating disruption. Lure loadings from 0.01 microgram to 50.0 mg were evaluated in 12 orchard plots in 1999. Lures loaded with 1.0-50.0 and 0.1-50.0 mg caught significantly more male and female moths than the blank control, respectively. Field dose-response studies were repeated with five lure rates (0.1-40.0 mg) of pear ester during four periods during the 2000 season. Significant seasonal date and rate effects were found for the capture of males and female moths. The 0.1-mg lure caught significantly fewer males than the 1.0-, 3.0-, and 40.0-mg lures. The 40.0-mg lure caught significantly fewer female moths than the 1.0- and 3.0-mg lures. The 3.0-mg lure caught a higher proportion of virgin females than the 10.0- and 40.0-mg lures. The attractiveness of the 1.0 and 3.0 mg pear ester loadings were compared with a sex pheromone lure during a 10-wk trial in 2002. Both pear ester lures caught significantly fewer moths than the sex pheromone lure during the first 4 wk of the study and over the entire 10-wk period. However, no difference among lures occurred during week 5, and the 3.0-mg lure caught significantly more moths than the sex pheromone lure during week 6. The 3.0-mg lure caught a significantly higher proportion of female moths and a higher proportion of virgin female moths than the 1.0-mg lure. These studies suggest that the optimal loading of pear ester for capture of codling moth in mating disrupted apple orchards likely depends on the specific objectives of the monitoring program.

TI  - Seasonal distribution of fall armyworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) host strains in agricultural and turf grass habitats. [electronic resource]
AB  - Male fall armyworm moths [Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)] were captured in pheromone traps over a 16- to 24-mo period in selected sites in southern Florida. Molecular markers were used to determine whether individuals were of one of two host strains (historically designated "rice-strain" and "corn-strain"). Traps placed in agricultural areas showed a population peak in the spring (March-May) and fall (October-December), with a prolonged decline in numbers in summer (July-October) and a smaller reduction in mid-winter (January). The host strain distribution during these periods varied significantly, suggesting strain-specific and seasonal population patterns. Both strains were captured in substantial numbers during the spring peak, but surprisingly, only the rice-strain showed an increase in capture rates during the fall, despite the presence of sweet corn throughout this period. Trap captures in a sod (turfgrass) farm were composed almost entirely of the rice-strain and showed a bimodal seasonal distribution similar to that seen in the agricultural areas, with peaks in the spring and fall. These results represent the first indication that the two host strains might have substantially different population dynamics in the overwintering agricultural areas of Florida and suggest that the rice-strain is the predominant fall armyworm pest during the fall and winter growing periods. It further indicates that the two strains can display a markedly different response to seasonal environmental cues. The implications of these findings on our understanding of fall armyworm migration are discussed.

TI  - Monitoring the regional spread of the invasive leafminer Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) by damage assessment and pheromone trapping
AB  - The leafminer Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic is an invasive pest of horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanum L., trees that has spread rapidly across Europe over the past 19 yr. It was recently reported in the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the Ukraine, and this spread is expected to continue through the Scandinavian countries until the northern limit of the host tree distribution is reached. The presence of the species is generally reported first in the cities, either as consequence of human-related transportation or because of the higher number of host trees in these areas. As a consequence, detailed studies of the spread of this pest through rural areas have not yet been carried out. We have monitored the spread of the moth at the fringe of its known distribution in eastern France during the period 2001-2003. The population was estimated by observing the damage caused by the pest and by establishing a network of pheromone traps. Pheromone traps were set up to measure two generations in 2001 and 2002, whereas the spatial pattern of the spread of the species measured by damage assessment was followed for each generation between 2001 and 2003 (nine generations). Spatial and temporal patterns in the population estimates made using these two methods were compared. We found that estimates made from damage assessment correlated with log-transformed estimates from pheromone trap catches, suggesting that both techniques can be used to monitor the spread of this pest. Over the period 2001-2003, the spread rate ranged from 17.0 to 37.9 km/yr, depending on the population threshold and method used.

TI  - Area-wide analysis of hardwood defoliator effects on tree conditions in the Allegheny Plateau
AB  - The effects of defoliation caused by three foliage feeding insects, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), the cherry scallopshell moth (Hydria prunivorata), and the elm spanworm (Ennomos subsignarius), on tree mortality and crown conditions were evaluated using data collected from 1984 to 1999 in the Allegheny National Forest located in northwestern Pennsylvania. While previous studies have focused on the effects of defoliation on trees in individual stands, this study differed in that it used exhaustive maps of defoliation and an areawide network of plots to assess these effects. A geographic information system was used to map the coincidence of USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis and Forest Health Monitoring plot locations with defoliation polygons derived from aerial surveys to calculate cumulative years of defoliation for each pest. Over 85% of the Allegheny National Forest land area was defoliated at least once during the 16-year period from 1984 to 1999. Frequency of defoliation by specific defoliator species was closely associated with the dominance of their primary hosts in stands. Frequency of defoliation was often associated with crown dieback and mortality, but these relationships were not detectable in all species. These results suggest that when impacts are averaged over large areas (such as in this study) effects of defoliation are likely to be considerably less severe than when measured in selected stands (as is the approach taken in most previous impact studies).

TI  - Seasonal abundance of the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella, in figs and the effect of peripheral aerosol dispensers on sexual communication [electronic resource]
AB  - We used flight traps baited with unmated female navel orangeworm Amyelois transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) to examine, over two growing seasons, seasonal changes in the abundance of males in fig orchards and the impact of release of 48 mg per ha per day of the pheromone component (Z,Z)-11,13-hexadecadienal from peripherally-located timed-release dispensers on the ability of males to find unmated females within 16-ha treatment plots. Material was placed out and mating disruption was commenced at the beginning of April in the first year, and at the beginning of July the second year. This technique effectively prevented males from finding females in female-baited traps placed throughout the plot. Navel orangeworm abundance was high in figs during the first and third flight, but lower in June and July during the second flight. Since Calimyrna figs are not susceptible to attack by navel orangeworm until mid-to-late July, these findings suggest that materials cost can be reduced by beginning treatment later. Implications for insect pest management in figs and other California crops are discussed.

TI  - Application of probability distribution to the sampling of cotton bollworms (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in Northern Cameroon
AB  - The main pests of cotton in Cameroon are the bollworms Helicoverpa armigera, Diparopsis watersi and Earias spp. The implementation of integrated management of these pests requires sampling plans for population monitoring. For practical reasons, these sampling plans have to enable the monitoring of the three bollworm species together rather than each separately. Based on our examination of 2083 samples, 80 or 100 plants each, this study shows that the number of larvae per plant fits a negative binomial distribution (NBD), with a common k value of 5.70, although the numbers of larvae of the three species considered separately fit different NBDs with k values ranging from 1.37 to 3.64. However, we show that possible fluctuations of the distribution resulting from fluctuations in the relative abundance of the three bollworm species would have little or no effect on either the fixed size or sequential sampling plans. We propose the design of a pegboard that allows the extension of sequential sampling in a smallholder context.

TI  - Temporal and spatial patterns of allelic frequencies in cotton bollworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - Temporal variation in allozyme frequencies at 10 allozyme loci was assessed by sampling six local populations of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), near cotton fields over 3 yr (1995-1997) in Leflore County, MS. Population structure over local and regional areas and changes in population structure over generations were analyzed using F-statistic estimators. There was low population differentiation at both local and regional scales, suggesting that extensive gene flow occurred within the spatial scale under investigation. Allele frequencies, heterozygosity, and the mean number of alleles per locus were stable over time and space. Measurements of population differentiation, F(ST), ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0072 over generations. However, there was no significant population subdivision when evaluated by bootstrapping over loci. Moreover, population differentiation as a whole and differentiation between regions was also very low, indicating that extensive gene flow occurs at both local and regional scales. Egg populations were more differentiated relative to the corresponding male moth populations, suggesting that population differentiation is greatest at egg/larval stages decreasing in adult populations due to movement. Almost all observed genetic variance was accounted for among traps within generations. Little variance was observed among generations or among years. These results further indicate that allele frequencies were stable over the duration of this study.

TI  - Abundance of a native moth Homoeosoma electellum (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) and activity of indigenous parasitoids in native and agricultural sunflower habitats
AB  - Insect herbivores have been assumed to be more abundant in agricultural habitats than in native habitats; however, this hypothesis is rarely tested explicitly by comparing field populations of domesticated plants and their wild ancestors. This study examined the abundance of the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst), and its parasitism by natural enemies in agricultural and native sunflower habitats. Nutrient levels and plant population factors in the two habitat types were measured to identify factors associated with the patterns of herbivory and parasitism. Adult male and larval H. electellum were consistently more abundant in agricultural habitats. In contrast, parasitism of H. electellum was 6-10 times higher in native sunflower habitats than in agricultural habitats. Also, fewer parasitoid species were found in agricultural habitats, and parasitism by individual parasitoid species was reduced by 90%. Larval densities per flower head were higher on agricultural plants, but parasitoids failed to respond to the higher densities. The relationship between flower age and larval infestation differed between agricultural and wild flowers; larval age tracked agricultural flower age, but on wild flowers, larvae moved from older to younger flowers. Among the three nutrients sampled, only nitrogen was positively correlated with habitat differences. These results indicate that patterns of trophic interactions varied by habitat type and were related to plant phenotypic changes and environmental habitat factors such as crop domestication, nitrogen fertilization, and plant phenology.

TI  - Comparative rates of density change in declining populations of the blackheaded budworm Acleris gloverana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) among different sites on Vancouver Island
AB  - Populations of western blackheaded budworm, Acleris gloverana (Walsingham), have fluctuated widely over the length of Vancouver Island with five outbreaks having occurred since 1941. The core of the severe defoliation occurred in the southern and northern portions of a central mountain chain running the length of the Island. Four monitoring sites were established in the central core area and five in peripheral sites during the 1970-1973 outbreak. At each site, samples were taken during five different life stages per generation, beginning at the peak of defoliation and ending when larval densities declined below detectable levels. The largest losses during the population collapse occurred during the larval period when large numbers abandoned the damaged trees by spinning off on silk threads. In addition, when age-specific survival ratios for each developmental stage were compared with the generation survival ratio, the closest relationship occurred between generation survival and the adult dispersal and oviposition period. Large emigration away from the central core area of defoliation to peripheral stands was detected, particularly during the first year of collapse. We suggest that, in response to damaged foliage, larvae and adults disperse from the stands and the outbreak collapses before the trees are killed. The dispersal response of defoliating populations appears to dampen the upward population trend. The trees survive, refoliate, and thus preserve the habitat for potential population increases during the next outbreak period. Host interrelationships during population gradations of the blackheaded budworm are compared with other conifer defoliators of British Columbia, particularly the western spruce budworm and the Douglas-fir tussock moth.

TI  - Distribution, relative importance and effect of lepidopterous borers on maize yields in the forest zone and mid-altitude of Cameroon
AB  - Geographic distribution, relative importance, and effect of lepidopterous stem and ear borers on maize, Zea mays L., were studied in the humid forest and the mid-altitude zones of Cameroon from 1994 to 1997. Six villages were chosen in the forest zone and grouped into three blocks representing gradients in human population density. A single block with three villages was chosen in the mid-altitude. Farmers' maize fields were surveyed during the vegetative growth phase for Busseola fusca (Fuller) egg batches, and at harvest for number of larvae and pupae by species, plant damage, and ear weight. There was no significant block effect for any of the variables measured, and most of the overall variance (72-99%) was attributed to within-field variability. In the forest zone, the noctuid B. fusca and the pyralid Eldana saccharina (Walker) accounted for >80% of all species in almost all locations, followed by the pyralid Mussidia nigrivenella (Ragonot) and the tortricid Cryptophlebia leucotreta (Meyrick). The noctuid Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) was found in almost all locations during the first season but disappeared in most locations in the second season. B. fusca egg infestation was significantly higher during the second compared with the first season, whereas larval and pupal densities were much higher during the first season. E. saccharina was the predominant species during the second season, when densities increased fourfold. In the mid-altitude, B. fusca was the predominant species. No significant differences in pest densities, plant damage, and ear weight were found between years. Results of stepwise regression of stem and ear damage on pest densities verified the relative importance of the individual species. In the forest zone, ear and stem damage significantly reduced ear weight, whereas in the mid-altitude only stem tunneling was significant.

TI  - Impact of Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) on leaf area development and yield of mature citrus trees in the Mediterranean area
AB  - Seasonal population trends and damage to citrus trees by the leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton were studied in the Valencia area of eastern Spain from 1996 to 1999. The area-wide seasonal flushing pattern of citrus trees and leafminer population trends were determined in 10 mature citrus orchards. In the 10 orchards, the annual percentage of new shoots that developed in the spring ranged from 51 to 96% for individual orchards (mean of 80%). Phyllocnistis citrella populations damaged new leaves from July to November. During this period, approximately equal to 45% of the new leaf area was lost due to leafminer mining. In addition, at three mature citrus orchards, two 'Navelina' sweet oranges from 1996 to 1999 and one 'Clementine' mandarin (variety 'Clemenules') in 1998 and 1999, the leaf area damage, spring flushing pattern, and crop yield were determined in trees sprayed one to three times a year with abamectin (Epimeck, 0.02%) to control P. citrella and compared with nonsprayed control trees. In these three orchards, damaged leaf area in summer-fall flushes was on average 52% in nonsprayed and 8% in sprayed trees. No significant differences were found between sprayed and nonsprayed trees in the spring flushing and flowering pattern, number of fruits or fruit diameter. In Mediterranean areas, P. citrella damaged only 5-15% of the annual new leaf area of mature trees and yield was usually not affected by the pest.

TI  - Seasonal changes in adult longevity and pupal weight of the nantucket pine tip moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) with implications for interpreting pheromone trap catch
AB  - Pheromone trap catches of the Nantucket pine tip moth, Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock), are often much higher during the first generation as compared with later generations, regardless of population density or damage levels. One hypothesis proposed to explain this phenomenon is reduced adult longevity during summer due to high temperatures. In this study, adult male and female moths placed in containers in the field during each generation showed significantly shorter life spans during the summer months compared with spring. Life spans were inversely related to the average number of daily degree-days accumulated during the investigations. In the laboratory, adult male moths under varying temperatures and constant humidity showed life spans similar to those observed in the field. Adult male moths that were provided with a sugar water solution in the laboratory did not have significantly longer life spans than those without. Male and female pupal weights showed little variation between generations and sites, and no observable changes in pupal weights occurred during the overwintering period. Some differences in female pupal weight between generations were found at some sites but these differences were not correlated with differences in adult life span. Temperature appeared to be the predominant factor affecting adult moth life span between generations, although other environmental and physiological factors may be important. An understanding of the lower trap catches for R. frustrana during summer may have important implications for using pheromone traps to predict population levels.

TI  - Susceptibility of male Oriental fruit moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) populations from New Jersey apple orchards to azinphosmethyl
AB  - Toxicological responses to azinphosmethyl of male Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), from five commercial orchards in which control failures had occurred were examined for azinphosmethyl resistance and for potential resistance mechanisms by using topical pheromone trap bioassay and compared with a reference population that had no history of control failure and had received little selection pressure. The 1998 field survey indicated moderate level of resistance to azinphosmethyl (2.7-4.1-fold); slopes of regressions lines (2.47-2.76) indicate genetically heterogeneous populations. An approximate twofold decline was observed between the fourth flight of 1998 and the first flight of 1999, suggesting the presence of unstable resistance in moths collected from these study sites. The 1999 field surveys indicated lower levels of tolerance to azinphosmethyl. The resistance ratios ranged from 1.17 to 1.86 during the first flight of 1999 and 1.24-2.64 during the fourth flight of 1999. Steep slopes of the concentration-response lines during 1999 season indicated the presence of genetically homogeneous populations with some exceptions. A 1.5-2.0-fold increase was observed between the first and fourth flights of 1999, indicating that resistance can build up during the growing season. S,S,S,-tri-n-butyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), but not piperonyl butoxide, significantly enhanced the toxicity of azinphosmethyl, suggesting that enhanced metabolism by esterases in involved in the tolerance of azinphosmethyl in moths collected from these study sties.

TI  - Predicting infestation levels of the Nantucket pine tip moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) using pheromone traps
AB  - There is considerable interest in using pheromone trap catches of the Nantucket pine tip moth, Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock), to estimate or predict population density and damage. At six sites in the Georgia Piedmont, adult tip moths were monitored through one or more years using pheromone traps while population density and damage for each tip moth generation were determined. During most years, trap catch was higher during the first adult generation compared with subsequent generations regardless of population density. Within each generation, trap catch was moderately to highly correlated with associated population density or damage levels. Hyperbolic regression models best described these relationships and suggested trap saturation when populations are high. Trap catch during the first adult generation was highly predictive of population density or damage during the subsequent generation. Trap catch during the second adult generation was fair at predicting subsequent density or damage. The models presented herein should be used with caution because they are likely to be region-specific. Validation of these relationships is necessary before widespread application of these models is warranted.

TI  - Interactions between Operophtera brumata and Tortix viridana on oak new evidence from time-series analysis
AB  - 1. Yearly population estimates of the green oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), and the winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera Geometridae), were taken from the pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, from 1951 to 1966 in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, U.K. Larval mortality from parasitoids was recorded for both species over the same period. 2. Operophtera brumata population density fluctuated around a constant mean, whereas T. viridana population density exhibited a linear decline over the sampling period. Population counts were subjected to time-series analysis after the linear decline was removed from the T. viridana data by detrending. Multiple regression models were built so that variation in the per capita rate of increase of each population could be partitioned among (a) current and previous population density, (b) current and previous population density of the second moth species, and (c) rates of larval parasitism. 3. Multiple regression analysis suggested that variation in the per capita rate of increase of O. brumata could be explained by negative feedback from O. brumata density at T-2 (32%), a negative relationship with T. viridana density at T-1 (18%), and a positive relationship with parasitism suffered by T. viridana at T-1 (24%). 4. The T. viridana population time-series was dominated by a rapid feedback process such that per capita rate of increase at time T was negatively related to population density at time T-1, explaining 53% of variance in population growth rate. Per capita rate of increase was unrelated to larval parasitism or densities of O. brumata. 5. In light of previous life-table and experimental studies on O. brumata and T. viridana, the current analyses suggest that pupal predation (data not presented) and interspecific competition are significant determinants of O. brumata population growth rates in Wytham Woods. In contrast, T. viridana population growth rates appear to be dominated by rapid negative feedback consistent with intraspecific competition.

TI  - Evaluation of low temperature mortality as a range-limiting factor for the southwestern corn borer (Lepidoptera Crambidae)
AB  - Evolutionary and ecological factors were used to assess the likelihood that low winter temperatures limit the range of Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (southwestern corn borer) in the east central United States. In controlled low-temperature mortality trials, dry diapausing laboratory-reared larvae were exposed for 2 d to constant temperatures, ranging from -6.9 to -10.0 degrees C. Mortality of larvae originating from Indiana at the northern range edge was not significantly different from mortality of larvae from Mississippi, over 500 km to the south. However, larvae from these populations had significantly lower mortality than did those from Arizona, suggesting that selection for increased cold-hardiness may have occurred early in the species' northeastward invasion of the central United States. Temperatures inside intact maize root crowns, the overwintering location of D. grandiosella, were measured over three winters in fields near the species' northern range edge. Although air temperatures fell below -19 degrees C for up to five consecutive days, root crown temperatures only approached -8 degrees C for periods of a few hours, due primarily to an underappreciated mitigating effect of freezing soil water. Because larvae originating from the east central United States had >60% survival when exposed to -8.8 degrees C for 2 d in the laboratory trials, mortality at the range edge caused by low temperatures was unlikely to have been severe for dry larvae during the three winters during which temperatures were measured. These results suggest that in most years, low winter temperatures are probably not the most important limiting factor at the species' northern range edge in the east central United States.

TI  - Structure and dynamics of a parasitoid community attacking larvae of Psilocorsis quercicella (Lepidoptera Oecophoridae)
AB  - This study investigated the temporal patterns of parasitoid attack and diversity within and among years and the potential ecological factors influencing the incidence of parasitism experience be the larvae of a bivoltine moth, Psilocorsis quercicella Clemens. To do this, field-collected larvae were reared throughout both generations during 1995-1997 in eastern Missouri. Annual variation in percentage parasitism was extremely low, ranging from 16.2 to 18.1%. Low annual variation in parasitism may contribute to host population stability. In contrast, intergenerational differences in percentage parasitism were highly significant in 2 of the 3 yr of study, with higher rates in the 1st generation (G1) than in the 2nd generation (G2). Instar at collection was a significant predictor of percentage parasitism during G1 but not during G2; this difference was likely caused by variation in the frequency of attack by idiobiont parasitoids in the 2 generations. Ten species of parasitoids were positively identified from the rearings. Of these, 3 were new records and 1 was a new species. A consistent increase in parasitoid species richness from G1 to G2 was found for all 3 yr, with several generalist parasitoids emerging only from larvae collected during G2. Host-switching behaviors related to seasonal differences in the abundance of a congener, P. reflexella Clemens, are hypothesized to contribute to the increased parasitoid diversity in G2. Although parasitoids were more likely to visit high-density ties, the risk of parasitism for individual larvae was independent of density of both conspecifics and heterospecifics occupying a leaftie. A field experiment examining the effects of prior tie occupancy on parasitism found that larvae placed in previously occupied ties were almost twice as likely to be parasitized (24.4%) as larvae placed in newly created ties (13.6%).

TI  - Identification of a four-component sex pheromone blend in Bonagota cranaodes (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - Analysis of sex pheromone glands of the apple leafroller Bonagota cranaodes Meyrick by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or electroantennographic detection showed the presence of 14 structurally related acetates and alcohols of the chain length 10-18, including the main pheromone component (E,Z)-3,5-dodecadienyl acetate (E3,Z5-12Ac). Male antennae responded to the main compound, its Z,Z isomer, (E,Z)-3,5-tetradecadienyl acetate (E3,Z5-14Ac), and the monoenes (Z)-5-dodecenyl acetate (Z5-12Ac) and (Z)-9-hexadecenyl acetate (Z9-16Ac). Traps baited with a four-component blend of E3,Z5-12Ac, Z5-12Ac, E3,Z5-14Ac, and Z9-16Ac in a 10055100 ratio were significantly more attractive than the main compound alone. This improved trap lure is more suitable for monitoring population densities of B. cranaodes, and for detection of the onset of the seasonal flight period. A more complete pheromone blend is of importance also with respect to current attempts to develop mating disruption for control of this major pest of apple in Brazil.

TI  - Size- and density-dependent reproductive success of bagworms, Metisa plana
AB  - A study conducted in a Malaysian plantation of oil palm over 5 consecutive generations of bagworms, Metisa plana (Walker) (Lepidoptera Psychidae), evaluated extent and causes of variability for 3 components of reproductive success pupal mortality, mating success and fecundity. The population of M. plana in the experimental site exhibited cycles of 70-80 days with discrete generations. Females emerged before males during all generations. Relatively large proportions of M. plana did not reproduce, either because they did not survive as pupa or (for females) mate as adult. Occurrence of unmated female bagworms may be attributed to complex mating procedure, short lifespan of females, limited mating capacity of males, protogyny inducing female-biased operational sex-ration, and/or flightlessness per se constraining mating success of females. Size attained at pupation is a significant component of reproductive success, with large individuals having greatest survival during pupal stage, mating success and fecundity. Population density also influenced reproductive success of M. plana female and (to a lesser extent) male larvae on crowded palms attained small size at pupation; survival of pupae was density-dependent during 2 generations for females and density-independent during 5 generations for males; mating success of females was inverse density-dependent during 4 generations. Size- and density-dependent mating success of females may be attributed to mate choice by males, size-dependent pheromone production by and longevity of females, and/or disorientation of mate-seeking males around heavily infested palms. Long-term studies are needed to determine whether and to what extent attributes of oil palm, seasonal fluctuations of abiotic factors and inter-generational variations of reproductive success influence population dynamics of M. plana.

TI  - Overwintering and spring migration in the bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in Israel
AB  - To clarify the relationship between overwintering and spring migration in the boll-worm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) in Israel, we caged larvae under field conditions in fall and used sex pheromone traps to monitor field populations the following spring. No diapause was detected in October-exposed individuals. Overall, 67.7 and 89.2% of the individuals exposed to field conditions during November and December, respectively entered pupal diapause. Most nondiapausing individuals eclosed early in the following January. In contrast, postdiapause adults started to eclose synchronously in late April. Approximately 50% of the postdiapaused females eclosed before 6 May, 9 d before 50% of the males did. Capture of field H. armigera moths in sex pheromone traps occurred 1 mo before the eclosion of adults from caged overwintering diapause pupae. Moths trapped before the eclosion of diapausing individuals had lower wing loading, fewer wing scales, and larger relative thorax size (ratio of thorax to head widths). These morphometric data imply that the early season field moths were trapped after long distance flight. Taken together, the phenological and morphometrical data support the notion that H. armigera exhibits an early-spring migratory behavior in Israel. These results are discussed within the context of physiological and genetic data from related studies.

TI  - Citrus leafminer (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) density effect on yield of "Tahiti" lime
AB  - The relationship between damage by citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, and 'Tahiti' lime yield were investigated in a 15-yr-old and a 5-yr-old lime orchard. Citrus leafminer population densities were controlled by insecticide applications of abamectin plus FC 435 oil, abamectin plus FC435 oil plus imidacloprid, and methomyl. The control was not treated. To ensure adequate citrus leafminer densities, adult citrus leafminer were periodically released in the experimental plots during fall and winter. For the 15-yr-old trees, the least amount of leaf area damage occurred in the abamectin plus FC 435 oil plus imidacloprid (1.9%) and the abamectin plus FC435 oil (2.3%) treatments compared with the control treatment (10-21%). In the 5-yr-old orchard, the least amount of leaf area damaged occurred in the abamectin plus FC435 oil plus imidacloprid (0.4%) and the imidacloprid (0.1%) treatments compared with the control (20.85%). The percentage of leaf area damaged was linearly correlated with the average number of mines per leaf, average mine days, and cumulative mine days in both orchards. In both orchards, the percentage of leaf area damaged and cumulative mine days was linearly correlated with the number of fruit per tree and total fruit weight per tree. Calculating the economic injury levels indicated that 16-23% and 18-85% of leaf area damaged caused significant yield reductions in 15-yr-old and 5-yr-old trees, respectively.

TI  - Simulation model of the Mediterranean flour moth (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in Danish flour mills
AB  - The Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia keuhniella Zeller, is a severe pest in Danish flour mills and was controlled by the use of methyl bromide until its ban in 1998. As a basis for exploring alternative control options, we developed a distributed-delay simulation model of flour moth population dynamics in the mills. Parameters for the temperature-dependent development of egg, larvae, and pupae and the lifespan and fecundity of female moths were obtained from published data. The model was validated against 3 yr of pheromone trap catches of male moths in a Danish mill. The overall phenology of the flour moth population was well simulated and was found to be determined largely by mill temperature and the seasonality of diapausing larvae. Based on the model it was estimated that the moth realizes on 1-3% of its reproductive potential from one year to the next. Reduced fecundity and juvenile mortality are the most likely regulating mechanisms. Model simulations based on historical weather data suggest that the increased temperature inside the mill drives the regular moth outbreaks, and that if mills were cooled to outdoor temperatures, the moth would become an outbreak pest less frequently.

TI  - Variation in herbivory by Yponomeuta mahalebella on its only host plant Prunus mahaleb along an elevational gradient
AB  - 1. The effect of natural variation in abiotic conditions on the herbivory interaction between Prunus mahaleb (Rosaceae) and its monophagous folivore, larvae of Yponomeuta mahalebella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae), was analysed for 2 consecutive years along an elevational gradient in Sierra de Cazorla, south-east Spain. 2. There was a negative correlation between site elevation and mean population herbivory level measured at the end of the growing period of Y. mahalebella. Mortality during larval development was higher at higher elevation sites, and mean adult body mass was higher in lower elevation populations. 3. Variation in temperatures recorded during the larval growth period at different altitudes was the only study factor related to abundance of Y. mahalebella larvae; neither differences in parasitisation rates nor plant features covaried significantly with herbivore abundance. 4. These results support the existence of geographical variation in plant-animal interactions in relation to environmental heterogeneity.

TI  - Stochastic simulation of growth loss in thinned balsam fir stands defoliated by the spruce budworm in Newfoundland
AB  - A stochastic simulation model was developed to derive a damage function for the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), and balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., herbivore interaction at the stand level for open-grown trees. Both aggregated and uniform models of attack pattern by late-instar larvae based on k of the negative binomial were evaluated to determine the impact of larval density and attack pattern on the loss in stemwood volume increment of young, thinned balsam fir stands in Newfoundland. Percentage loss in stemwood increment was a nonlinear, negative exponential function of initial larval density. Implementation of control measures to prevent 50% defoliation that is caused by about 14 larvae/branch tip would result in saving 24% of the annual stemwood increment after 1 year of defoliation and about 32% after 2 years of cumulative defoliation. Aggregation of spruce budworm larvae among trees within a forest stand results in less growth loss compared with a uniform pattern of attack. The nonlinear damage function may suggest tolerance and possibly compensatory growth after herbivory by low population levels of the spruce budworm.

TI  - Population structure of a monophagous moth in a patchy landscape
AB  - 1. The population structure of a monophagous noctuid moth, Abrostola asclepiadis, living on a patchily distributed perennial herb, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria is described. The study took place over 5 years at a landscape scale (about 12 km2). 2. Patch occupancy rates and population densities were studied in relation to patch size, degree of patch isolation, level of sun exposure and distance from the coast. In addition, flight tests in the laboratory were performed to estimate the potential dispersal capacity of the moth. 3. Occupancy rates were high and the likelihood of extinction depended on patch size. Small patches were less likely to be occupied than were large patches (> 10 m2). Sun-exposed patches were occupied for a lower proportion of years than were shaded patches. No distance effects could be discerned at the spatial scale of study, presumably because the insect is a strong flier. 4. Population densities in occupied patches decreased with increasing patch size. Furthermore, insect densities tended to increase with distance from the coast. Density changes in patches were synchronized. 5. The studied insect population can be described as a 'patchy population' sensu Harrison (1991) with spatially correlated population dynamics. These dynamics are superimposed on a landscape gradient.

TI  - Developing mating disruption of obliquebanded leafroller (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in Washington State
AB  - Field studies were conducted from 1992 to 1996 to select the most effective sex pheromone blend for mating disruption of the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), in tree fruit orchards in Washington. Dispensers loaded with a 2-component pheromone blend, (Z)-11-tetradecen-1-yl (Z11-14OAc) and (E)-11-tetradecen-1-yl (E11-14OAc), a 3-component blend that included the addition of (Z)-11-tetradecenal (Z11-14Ald, and a 4-component blend also including (Z)-11-tetradecen-1-ol (Z11-14OH) were compared within 0.1-ha orchard plots and 100-m2 field cages. The addition of Z11-14Ald to the 2 acetate components with or without Z11-14OH did not improve mating or disruption of communication. No disruption occurred in field cages treated with E11-14OAc alone or an 8812 (%) EZ 11-14OAc blend. Management of C. rosaceana with mating disruption was evaluated for 2 yr in three 16-ha apple orchards by using a 946% ZE11-14OAc blend. Orchards were treated with 1,000 polyethylene tube dispensers per hectare emitting approximately 0.9 mg of pheromone per day. Populations were also monitored in 3 similar 8-ha orchards treated only with insecticides. Catches of male moths in traps baited with synthetic lures and virgin females were significantly lower (92-99%) in pheromone-treated than in untreated orchards. Larval population densities and fruit injury did not differ between treatments. No significant differences were found in larval population densities, trap catch, or fruit injury between the 2-ha center and the outer 14-ha areas of the pheromone-treated orchards. Significant increases in catch by lure-baited traps and fruit injury occurred in the pheromone-treated orchards from the 1st to 2nd yr of the study. The pheromone treatment saved approximately $250/ha in insecticide costs over 2 yr.

TI  - Seasonal variation of pheromone concentration in mating disruption trials against European grape vine moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) measured by EAG
AB  - Spatial and temporal distributions and relative concentrations of the pheromone of the European grape vine moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) were measured in mating disruption trials with electroantennograms. Measurements were carried out over several years during the flight season of the two generations of this pest insect. In three consecutive years significantly higher mean relative pheromone concentrations were measured in summer during the flight of the second generation of L. botrana than in spring during the flight of the first generation (P < 0.001). The relative pheromone concentrations in 1989 reached a maximum between late July and early August, when the highest mean daily temperatures were registered. In addition to the differences in mean relative pheromone concentrations, the spatial and temporal distributions of the pheromone differed significantly between spring and summer. EAG recordings taken in summer showed high, uniform pheromone concentrations in the treated plots, whereas in spring strong temporal and spatial fluctuations were recorded. In a vineyard defoliated by a hailstorm, the mean relative pheromone concentrations measured in summer were not significantly different from those measured in spring (P > 0.05), but were significantly lower than those of a nearby intact vineyard (P < 0.001). The results provided additional evidence that foliage is an important parameter determining mean pheromone concentrations and temporal and spatial distribution of pheromone in mating disruption trials.

TI  - Forecasting emergence, flight, and oviposition of Spilonota ocellana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), in British Columbia
AB  - Eyespotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis & Schiffermuller), is becoming an important pest of pome fruits in British Columbia because implementation of noninsecticidal controls for codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., have removed routine sprays that inadvertently controlled it. Knowing the phenology of S. ocellana could improve timing of controls for this pest. Seasonal flight activity of male, eyespotted bud moths was monitored using pheromone-baited traps hung in unsprayed apple (Malus pumila Mill.) orchards in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia from 1993 to 1996. Emergence of adult males and females and oviposition was monitored from 1994 to 1996 to establish relationships between their phenology and accumulated degree-days above 10 degrees C air temperature or number of days after the 1st moth was caught (biofix). Biofix occurred between 1-5 June, except in 1996, when it occurred 2-3 wk later, and flight activity continued until late August. Males and females emerged on the same day, 2.0 +/- 1.7 d (mean +/- SD, n = 3 yr) before biofix, and oviposition began 4.3 +/- 1.5 d after biofix. The nonlinear relationship between cumulative trap catch and d or number of degree-days after biofix was modeled with cumulative Weibull functions. A model based on data from Summerland using days after biofix as the predictor variable was more accurate at predicting the interval between biofix and 50% cumulative trap catch for independent data sets from Kelowna and Winfield than a model using degree-days after biofix as the predictor variable. However, the use of degree-days as a predictor variable has wider application to other regions and years. Similar models were used to describe the relationship between days or degree-days after biofix and cumulative emergence of males, emergence of females, and oviposition, respectively. These models will assist in the development of pheromone-based management programs for the eyespotted bud moth, and can be used to formulate control strategies for this pest.

TI  - Effects of moonlight and meteorological factors on light and bait trap catches of noctuid moths (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - The effects of moon-phase and meteorological factors on activity of adult noctuid moths were investigated using light and bait traps in southern Spain for 170 nights (2 sampling years). The number of individuals caught in the light trap increased with temperature and decreased with the fullness of the moon. The effect of temperature on flight activity was similar between light and bait traps. The total number of individuals recorded in the bait trap was not affected by fullness of the moon. Increased cloud cover increased catches in light traps, but not bait traps. Bait trap records were lower on windy nights. Average light trap catch varied 6- to 9-fold because of changes in temperature. Moonlight and cloud cover caused light trap captures to vary approximately 2-fold. Bait trap records were at least as strongly affected by meteorological factors. No significant differences in effects of moonlight and meteorological factors on trap catch were detected between years. The strength of environmental effects on trap catch make it difficult to obtain an accurate record of both community composition and the abundance of individual species.

TI  - Effect of forest stand and edge characteristics on the vulnerability of jack pine stands to jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus) damage
AB  - We determined how factors originating within individual jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forest stands (local effects) and factors originating in neighbouring forest stands (adjacency effects) affected and modified severity and consequences of defoliation during a jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus Freeman) (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) outbreak in northern Michigan from 1992 to 1994. Defoliation, top kill, and tree mortality were monitored in 104 stands annually and forest inventory data were collected for each stand. Defoliation was widespread in 1992 and then declined in 1993 and 1994. The oldest stands were most susceptible to defoliation, top kill, and mortality. Contrary to expectations, mortality was highest in relatively good sites. However, characteristics of adjacent stands also affected the susceptibility of a focal stand stands adjacent to younger trees sustained more defoliation than would be expected based on their age. We hypothesize that pollen cones, which contribute to survival of early instar larvae, may have been more abundant in trees exposed to full light, a situation likely to occur along the edges of stands growing next to openings, roads, or young trees. Thus, both the stand age and boundary to a younger and shorter forest stand may contribute to budworm outbreak at the local level.

TI  - Patterns of spider (Araneae) abundance during an outbreak of western spruce budworm (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - Spiders are acknowledged predators on all life stages of western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman, yet little is known about their communities in budworm infested forests. Systematic samples of arboreal spiders were taken from the mid-crowns of Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii variety glauca (Beissner) Franco, and grand fir, Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindley, for 3 consecutive years during a budworm out-break. Densities over the 3-yr period averaged 5.6 spiders and 288.0 fourth-instar budworms per square meter of branch area. Spider densities were significantly higher on Douglas-fir (7.8/m2) than on grand fir (4.6/m2); however, species composition of spiders was similar on both tree species. Overall densities of spiders did not differ significantly over the 3 yr. All sampled spiders were classified by family; but because of large numbers of juveniles only 20% could be identified to species. Nonetheless, 13 families an at least 26 species were represented in the samples. Relative abundance of both families and species followed a typical logarithmic-series distribution in which a relatively few taxa accounted for most of the individuals sampled. Total number of spiders sampled was about evenly divided between web-spinning (47.3%) and hunting (52.7%) guilds; however, there were almost twice as many web-spinning species as hunting species. Species-diversity indices also were consistently higher each year for web-spinners than for hunters. The salticid species Pelegrina aeneola (= Metaphidippus aeneolus) (Curtis), a well-known predator of defoliating insects, was clearly dominant each year and accounted for almost half of all hunting spiders. The results offer a convenient marker for comparison with the relative structure of arboreal spider communities in other forest ecosystems.

TI  - Seasonal abundance of diamondback moth (Lepidoptera Yponomeutidae) on Crambe abyssinica
AB  - Little information is available on seasonal abundance of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), in the northern Great Plains. This study was conducted in Fargo, ND, in 1993, 1994, and 1995 to examine the seasonal population changes of P. xylostella in the crop host, crambe, Crambe abyssinica Hochst. ex R. E. Fries, and the weed host, field pennycress, Thlaspi arvense L. The abundance of adults was measured using pheromone traps and by flushing them from vegetation. The 1st peak in adult density was observed in the weed host and the subsequent peaks in the crop were recorded at approximately 300 DD (base 7.5 degrees C) intervals. In 1993, these peak flights occurred in early to mid-June and July; in 1994 in early to mid-June, mid-July, and mid- to late August; and in 1995 at the end of June, mid-July, early to mid-August, and early September. The sex ratio based on larval collections was approximately 11. There was a strong relationship between the egg density and visual counts of flushed adults. From the comparison of phenology of the crop host and P. xylostella, the 1st-generation larvae may be injurious if the crop is planted early and no weeds are available to ovipositing females near the crop. The larvae present in the 2nd half of July may potentially injure the ripening crop.

TI  - Prevalence and persistence of nuclear polyhedrosis virus in fluctuating populations of forest tent caterpillars (Lepidoptera Lasiocampidae) in the area of Prince George, British Columbia
AB  - Infection by nuclear polyhedrosis virus commonly occurs in outbreak populations of forest Lepidoptera. However, nothing is known about viral infection in populations of forest caterpillars that declined to low density. We used DNA dot-blot hybridization to identify viral infection in caterpillars collected from 6 field populations of forest tent caterpillars in the vicinity of Prince George, BC. Over the 5 yr of observations, populations at 4 sites declined from high to low densities. Viral infection was generally highest among caterpillars from dense and declining populations but persisted at low levels in sparse populations. Populations at 2 sites which erupted in the last 2 yr of the study had levels of infection comparable to populations which were at high density at the beginning of the study.

TI  - Reduction of pink bollworm (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) populations in the Imperial Valley, California, following mandatory short-season cotton management systems [electronic resource]
AB  - A cotton management program in the Imperial Valley, California, was specifically designed to reduce pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), populations in the area by optimizing the host-free period. The program established 1 March as the earliest planting date, 1 September for defoliant or plant growth regulator application and 1 November for cotton stalk destruction and plowdown. In-season gossyplure-baited pink bollworm male moth activity monitoring and immature green cotton boll inspections for larval infestation were encouraged as decision making aids to determine the need for additional control action. Male pink bollworm moth catches in gossyplure-baited Lingren and delta sticky traps were substantially reduced each year from 1990 to 1994 following the initiation of the management program in 1989. Fewer larvae per cotton boll occurred in the years from 1990 to 1992. Fiber quality of commercial cotton sampled was also improved from 1989 to 1994, as compared with the 1984 to 1988 average. Male moth trap catches in gossyplure-baited traps placed around the perimeter of the Imperial Valley suggest that pink bollworm moth migration into the valley occurred from surrounding cotton growing areas during the growing season. Highest numbers of moths were caught in perimeter traps directionally placed toward cotton growing areas in the Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, and Bard-Winterhaven and Palo Verde, CA. Cotton production, in general, was reduced during 1989-1994 in these areas and may have contributed partially to reduced populations in Imperial Valley.

TI  - Plant aging and the distribution of Rhyacionia neomexicana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - A noted pattern of attack by larvae of pine tip moths, Rhyacionia spp., has been that young trees are susceptible and older trees remain unattacked. We undertook a quantitative test of this conventional wisdom and tested the following 4 hypotheses that may account for the pattern (1) the plant age hypothesis, (2) the plant vigor hypothesis, (3) the plant stress hypothesis, and (4) the induced defense hypothesis. Ponderosa pine, ponderosa Lawson, near Flagstaff. AZ, were examined for attack by southwestern pine tip moths, Rhyacionia neomexicana (Dyar), over an age range of 300 yr. No current attacks were found on trees older than 20 yr or taller than 4 m tall, providing quantitative support for conventional wisdom and the plant age hypothesis. As trees aged, there was a significant increase in shoot diameter (r2 = 0.22, P < 0.0001) which could not account for the lack of attack after age 20. Within individual trees attack was concentrated on the largest shoots, supporting the plant vigor hypothesis instead of the plant stress hypothesis. Attack in previous years did not influence attack in the current year, indicating a lack of induced plant defense. The results indicate the importance of genetically regulated ontogenetic aging as a strong negative influence on attack. Yet within the young age group of attacked trees larger shoots were attacked more frequently than smaller shoots. The results suggest that shoot borers and shoot gallers show similar relationships to their host plants and aid in the recognition of broad patterns in plant-herbivore interactions.

TI  - Bionomics of tufted apple bud moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in apple orchard ground cover
AB  - Tufted apple bud moth, Platynota idaeusalis (Walker), larval movement, host utilization, and spatial and temporal distribution were examined in ground covers of apple orchards in south-central Pennsylvania. Larvae were placed in arenas 0 or 30-50 cm from host material of dandelion, Taraxacum officinale Weber, or fallen apples in the autumn. The number and location of exuvia were recorded in the spring. Survival was greater on dandelion than on fallen apples with neither the distance nor distance by host effects being significant. Larval fitness was measured on apple root suckers; broadleaf weeds, tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreber 'Kentucky 31'; and dead organic matter (fallen leaves and apples). Survival and adult weight were low on dead organic matter. Adult weight was low for larvae caged on tall fescue. Larval density before and after orchard raking and mowing was examined. Raking moved larvae into the tree row middles, although raking and mowing did not cause significant mortality. In a 2-yr orchard survey, larval density declined 85% between autumn and spring samples. Larval distribution in ground cover zones varied by season. In the autumn, most larvae were in the herbicide strip and associated with fallen leaves and root suckers. In the spring of the larvae were located m the border between the herbicide strip and the drive row (tree row middles), and association with fallen leaves was still strong. In the summer, larval distribution was most uniform between zones and larvae were associated with root suckers and broadleaf weeds. Ground cover management tactics are discussed.

TI  - Studies on the ecology of the yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) (Pyralidae), in deepwater rice in Bangladesh
AB  - The yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker), emerged as the dominant pest of deepwater rice in an intensive 4-year ecological study in two farmers' fields in central Bangladesh. There were six annual broods. In brood 1 developing in transplanted dry season rice and brood 2 migrating to preflooded deepwater rice, the population density and level of stem damage were low. Borer populations built up in broods 3, 4 and 5 in flooded deepwater rice to reach densities of 16-52 immatures m-2, which damaged 33-80% of the stems. Borer populations declined in brood 6 at the end of the deepwater rice season, the larvae entering diapause in the field stubbles. The major factors regulating the populations were as follows the incidence of weather extremes (temperatures > 34 degrees C with relative humidity < 70%) before flooding which are lethal to eggs and first instars; the presence of succulent, elongating stems which are favourable for larval penetration and development; the occurrence of rapid water rises (6-8 cm day-1) which drown the immature stages; the activity of natural enemies, particularly the complex of egg parasitoids, and spider and orthopteran predators; and the harvesting and threshing operations which kill many diapausing larvae in the stems. An early season population outbreak in 1977 was associated with exceptionally mild, wet weather; the highest population density and level of stem damage followed a late surge of flooding in 1980 that produced a second flush in elongating stems. The ecological studies revealed two occasions during the season when control measures might be feasible.

TI  - Symbiotic nitrogen fixation and yield of soybean following defoliation by soybean looper (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) during pod or seed development
AB  - Acetylene reduction and nitrogen difference assays were used to evaluate effects of defoliation by soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker), during reproductive growth stages on symbiotic nitrogen fixation by soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill. Defoliation (74-94%) of group IV 'Clark' caused 80-100% reduction of ethylene produced per gram nodule dry weight (nodule specific activity), regardless of whether defoliation occurred during bloom and pod development or during seed development. Defoliation (50-55%) of group VI cultivar 'Lee' from full bloom into pod development stages caused up to 69% reduction of nodule specific activity, whereas lower defoliation levels (32%) during seed development did not affect this parameter. The nitrogen difference assay did not identify reductions in the amount of nitrogen acquired from symbiotically fixed sources in response to defoliation except in 1 experiment when 55% defoliation of Lee occurred during a period from full bloom into early seed development. However, this assay was useful for determining the influence of N acquired from soil and fixed sources on plant N status. Up to 68% of the N in nondefoliated nodulating isoline plants was acquired from fixed sources. Nitrogen deficiency symptoms (chlorosis) were evident by early seed development, indicating that soil N was becoming depleted by that growth stage. In general, when averaged across cultivars and years, greater amounts of N were acquired from fixed sources by the early seed development stage (54%) than by bloom and pod development stages (35%). Yield of Clark was reduced by 800-1,359 kg/ha (74-94% defoliation, full bloom through pod development) and by 750 kg/ha (94% defoliation, early seed development). Yield of Lee was reduced by 1,492 kg/ha (50% defoliation, full bloom through pod development) and by 971 kg/ha (32% defoliation, early seed development).

TI  - Ninety-seven million years of angiosperm-insect association paleobiological insights into the meaning of coevolution
AB  - From well preserved leaf damage of the mid-Cretaceous Dakota Flora (97 million years ago), three distinctive, insect-mediated feeding traces have been identified and assigned to two extant genera and one subfamily. These taxa are the leaf miners Stigmella and Ectoedemia of the Nepticulidae and Phyllocnistinae of the Gracillariidae. These fossils indicate that within 25 million years of early angiosperm radiation, the organs of woody dicots already were exploited in intricate and modern ways by insect herbivores. For Ectoedemia and its platanoid host, we document 97 million years of continuity for a plant-insect interaction. The early occurrence during the mid-Cretaceous of diverse and extensive herbivory on woody angiosperms may be associated with the innovation of deciduousness, in which a broad-leafed angiosperm provided an efficient, but disposable, photosynthetic organ that withstood the increased cost of additional insect herbivory. Moreover, the group represented in this study, the leaf-mining Lepidoptera, exhibits a wide range of subordinal taxonomic differentiation and includes the Gracillariidae, a member of the most derived lepidopteran suborder, the Ditrysia. Ditrysian presence during the mid-Cretaceous, in addition to lepidopteran body-fossil evidence from Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic deposits, suggests that the radiation of major lepidopteran lineages probably occurred during the Late Jurassic on a gymnosperm-domimated flora.

TI  - Foodplant effects on colour morphs of Eumorpha fasciata caterpillars (Lepidoptera Sphingidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - Caterpillars of the hawkmoth Eumorpha fasciata are highly polymorphic for colour, with green, pink, and pink-and-yellow forms in the second through fourth instars, and green and multicoloured forms in the fifth instar. Four years of field censuses on four foodplant species determined that all morphs were found on all plant species; morph frequencies were homogeneous on each plant species over time; and morph frequencies differed consistently among plant species. When larvae were reared from eggs on three of the hostplant species in the laboratory, differences in morph frequencies paralleled the census results. Thus foodplant quality is one factor affecting larval colour in E. fasciata. A literature survey reveals that foodplant effects on larval colouration may be widespread in the family Sphingidae, but most reports are anecdotal rather than experimental. The implications of this mechanism of colour determination are discussed.

TI  - Jack pine budworm population behaviour in northwestern Wisconsin
AB  - Long-term (17-31 year) density estimates of jack pine budworm, Choristoneura pinus pinus Free. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), populations from 31 townships in northwestern Wisconsin were analyzed to investigate variation in population behaviour. Populations had varying combinations of cyclic components with periods of 5, 6, and 10 years. Populations that fluctuated with higher frequencies (shorter periods between outbreaks) tended to be found in locations where the habitat type was indicative of nutrient-poor and extremely dry soils. Many populations in these habitat types had high mean densities, and the coefficient of variation in density was smaller than that in other populations. Just under half (14) of the populations were regulated by statistically significant second-order density-dependent processes. Nevertheless, second-order processes were present to some extent in all populations examined. These results demonstrated that detection of density dependence and population regulation of jack pine budworm depends on the local site where studies are undertaken. Population fluctuations encountered in these populations are of the phase-forgetting quasi-cyclic kind. Studies of mechanisms that account for these cycles and cause populations to fluctuate at three different characteristic frequencies promise to be rewarding.

TI  - Comparison of pheromone trap bioassays for monitoring insecticide resistance of Phyllonorycter elmaella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae)
AB  - Two pheromone trap assays were evaluated for monitoring insecticide resistance of Phyllonorycter elmaella (Doganlar & Mutuura). For both assays, male moths were collected in the field with pheromone-baited sticky traps. In the first test, we used topical application of 0.2 microliters of an insecticide-solvent mixture to the dorsal surface of each moth. In the second assay, we incorporated the pesticide into the adhesive so that moths were exposed upon capture. The assays were compared for their ability to characterize the response to insecticides of susceptible and resistant field populations of P. elmaella. Both assays adequately described the concentration-mortality response to azinphosmethyl and oxamyl of susceptible male P. elmaella moths. However, only the topical assay was a suitable method for quantifying the mortality response of moths with high azinphosmethyl resistance. Concentration-mortality response lines could not be produced with the insecticide-laced adhesive assay for azinphosmethyl-resistant moths. Moths from commercial apple and cherry orchards treated topically with azinphosmethyl were 56-71-fold more resistant than moths collected from an isolated abandoned site. Azinphosmethyl-resistant P. elmaella male moths were still susceptible to oxamyl. Male P. elmaella moths did not avoid traps with oxamyl-laced adhesive, but moths from azinphosmethyl-resistant populations were repelled by azinphosmethyl at a rate of 10 mg (AI)/g adhesive, indicating the possibility of behavioral resistance and a bias in the collection of test subjects with this bioassay method. Despite these shortcomings, the insecticide-laced adhesive assay may still be useful for diagnostic-dose surveys and for resistance detection programs.

AB  - Muscadine grape vines were excavated from vineyards in southern Mississippi and examined for damage caused by the grape root borer, Vitacea polistiformis (Harris), and for the presence of borer larvae. Generally young vines (< 12 yr old) had no visible root borer damage and no borers were present; vines 12 to 15 yr old had moderate damage and borers were present; older vines had severe damage and borers were present. Grape root borer populations were monitored over 5 yr with pheromone traps. No moths were trapped before 15 june or after 2 October. Peak moth captures occurred from 15 July through 2 September. These data indicate that vineyards in southern Mississippi should be treated with an insecticide during the 2nd or 3rd wk of July for effective grape root borer control.

TI  - Management of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on chickpea in southern India thresholds and the economics of host plant resistance and insecticide application
AB  - A study of the influence of the density of larval Helicoverpa armigera (instars 4-6) on the seed yield of chickpea plants growing in large cages indicated that one larva per plant was a critical density as far as economic injury levels are concerned. The results indicated that larval feeding activity during the first 2 weeks of flowering had no effect on yield. There was also no evidence of compensatory growth following insect attack during the flowering stage. These data were adopted to set action thresholds in a large (0.8 ha) field experiment that was designed to investigate the economics of insecticide application in the context of an on-farm chickpea enterprise. The field was managed with bullock-drawn implements and hand labour. Insecticides were applied to three varieties--Annigeri (an insect-susceptible landrace), ICCC 37 (a recently released variety) and ICC 506 (an insect-resistant landrace)--weekly, not at all (controls) and when the larval density exceeded 0.5 or 2.0 per plant. Economic parameters were assembled from village and local market records. Helicoverpa had a marked effect on the yield of the two pest-susceptible varieties, both of which would have made a loss in the context of a chickpea enterprise unless protected by insecticides. Helicoverpa-resistant ICC 506 did not achieve as high a yield as the other two varieties when treated with insecticides but did 'make a profit' when no insecticide was applied. The relationship between yield and insect days was virtually identical for Annigeri and ICCC 37. The latter needed five insecticide applications to maximize yield and the former four. The relationships between insect day summations (integrals of population curves) for eggs, and small and large larvae, suggested that eggs were undersampled and were not suitable as an indicator for insecticide applications. The density of small larvae, although probably undersampled, was a suitable indication of the damage likely to be caused by the large larvae they would develop into. A set of insect day summations indicates when insecticides in the current price range (Rs300, 400 or 850 ha-1) need to be applied. The thresholds were verified in neighbouring fields. Three insecticide applications during the following season resulted in a greater than threefold increase in yield (from 0.65 to 2.2 t ha-1).

TI  - Relationships between environmental factors and capture time of male pink bollworm (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) moths in traps baited with sex pheromone
AB  - Peak capture time of male pink bollworm moths, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), was determined from 16 pheromone traps placed at the edges of several cotton fields and monitored at 45-min intervals on each of 42 nights during the cotton growing season from April through November 1990-1992 in California's Palo Verde Valley. Peak time of capture correlated significantly with times of sunset, sunrise, and wind speeds falling below 2.68 m/s, minimum temperature of the same and previous nights, and maximum temperature. Stepwise and backwards elimination regressions were used to develop a model of predicted capture time, which showed that minimum night temperature, time when wind speed fell below 2.68 m/s, and moon age provided a good fit. By including minimum temperature in the model, time of sunset did not correlate significantly, with capture time. Predicted peak capture time occurred 30 min later for each degree increase in minimum night temperature up to 20 degrees C and was delayed by as much as 2 h by wind speeds above 2.68 m/s before 2100 hours and by 1 h during new moon compared with full moon.

TI  - Survey of azinphosmethyl resistance in codling moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in Washington and Utah
AB  - A bioassay in which azinphosmethyl was incorporated into the adhesive of a sex pheromone trap was developed to detect resistance in populations of male codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). Experiments were done to evaluate the influence of the length of the bioassay, moth body position in the adhesive, moth age, and extremes of temperature and relative humidity (RH) experienced by moths caught in traps in the field. Moth's body position and age for moths < 5 d old were not significant factors affecting moth mortality. Exposure to low humidity (45% RH) or low to high temperatures (10-25 degrees C) for up to 12 h did not significantly affect mortality. Forty-eight populations were surveyed in Washington, and three populations were surveyed in Utah during 1991-1992 with a discriminating concentration, 75 micrograms (AI)/g adhesive; moth mortality was scored after 64 h at 20 degree C and > 85% RH. Populations from crabapple plantings, certified-organic, abandoned, and conventional orchards were sampled. Twenty of 44 populations monitored in 1991 and 12 of 17 populations monitored in 1992 had significant levels of resistance compared with a susceptible laboratory strain based on nonoverlapping 95% CL. All but one of these resistant populations were from current conventional or recently abandoned conventional orchards. Results from the 10 orchards sampled in both years were not significantly different. Resistance in a population collected in 1991 reverted rapidly when removed from exposure to azinphosmethyl and reared on apple in the laboratory.

TI  - Cotton leafperforator (Lepidoptera Lyonetiidae) pheromone studies
AB  - The cotton leafperforator (CLP) Bucculatrix thurberiella Busck. is a sporadic pest of cotton in the southwest desert area. Tests were conducted in 1992 and 1993 to determine the effective life of CLP polyethylene pheromone dispensers, correlate CLP male moth catches to cotton field infestations, determine seasonal distributions of CLP, and to determine effect of trap height on moth catches. The polyethylene pheromone dispensers were effective for about 4 weeks. In 1993, the best correlation coefficients were obtained by comparing CLP moth catches/night to main stem leaf damage at the sixth node position from top of plants at field edges. CLP windows per leaf and trap catches had the highest coefficient of determination, r2 = 0.52. There was more than twice as much CLP damage to leaves at field edges when compared to leaves 10 m into the field. The first CLP moth capture occurred in early to late July each year and increased rapidly in August to 100 to 200/trap/night, but was variable in September with a high of 300 and a low of 9/trap/night. CLP-baited delta traps placed 0.3 to 0.6 m above ground caught more moths than traps placed at heights up to 1.8 m from 11 to 21 August.

TI  - Hatch of blackheaded fireworm (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) eggs and prediction with temperature-driven models
AB  - Egg hatch of blackheaded fireworm, Rhopobota naevana (Hubner), was monitored in Wisconsin and British Columbia. In Wisconsin, hatch of overwintering eggs began during the last 2 wk of April, median hatch occurred during the first week of May, and hatch ended in late May. In British Columbia, hatch began in late March to early April, median hatch occurred in April, and hatch ended (except for one egg in both years that hatched in June) in late April in 1991 but extended into late May in 1992. Summer-generation eggs began hatching 2-7 d and completed hatch 6-15 d after oviposition in both regions. A linear spline model developed in Wisconsin predicted 50% hatch of overwintering eggs in Wisconsin to within +/- 5.5 d standard deviation. The model had extreme error in predicting hatch in British Columbia. A linear model predicted 50% hatch of summer-generation eggs in both Wisconsin and British Columbia to within +/- 1 d standard deviation.

TI  - Preventive insecticide resistance strategy in Helicoverpa (Heliothis) armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in Israeli cotton
AB  - Since 1987 an insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy has been implemented in cotton fields in Israel. To assess the efficacy of the IRM strategy, a long-term monitoring program in Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) was undertaken to test the response of this pest to various insecticides. The monitoring technique was based on the exposure of pheromone trap-caught males to residues of four common compounds representing the major groups of insecticide. The diagnostic concentrations, established on LC80-90 of a susceptible H. armigera field population, were 0.57 microgram endosulfan, 0.74 microgram cypermethrin, 0.38 microgram methomyl, and 2.0 microgram methidathion per scintillation vials. Collections of H. armigera moths were done during the cotton growing seasons of 1987 through 1991. In general, the results indicate that the susceptibility of H. armigera to the test compounds was not appreciably altered from 1987 to 1991, although fluctuations during the season were observed. In most cases, the resistance levels to the test compounds fluctuated in a typical V-shaped curve during the season. The susceptibility of H. armigera to the various insecticides observed during the course of this study is consistent with the proposition that the IRM strategy can be correlated with successful management of resistance in this pest.

TI  - Impact of late-season orangestriped oakworm (Lepidotpera Saturniidae) defoliation on oak growth and vigor
AB  - The orange striped oakworm, Anisota senatoria (J.E. Smith), has caused widespread defoliation of urban oak (Quercus) species in southeastern Virginia. The hypothesis that consecutive years of late-season defoliation by A. senatoria would cause a significant reduction in Quercus growth and vigor was tested from 1987 to 1990. Late-season A. senatoria defoliation had a significant impact on Quercus growth and vigor. Pin oak, Q. palustris (Muenchhausen), and willow oak, Q. phellos L., planted in fabric containers, had significant reduction in growth with increased defoliation. Starch content and tree vigor in Q. palustris, planted in the urban landscape, was significantly reduced with increased defoliation, and some tree mortality occurred. Quercus phellos was a hardier species compared with Q. palustris and was not significantly affected by consecutive late-season defoliation. In addition, data suggested that Q. palustris was affected more by A. senatoria late-season defoliation when trees were planted in stressed urban sites. These data have important implications for A. senatoria management strategies. High populations that have the potential to cause 100% late-season defoliation during consecutive years should be controlled to prevent progressive decline in tree health.

TI  - The effects of some agrometeorological factors on fluctuations of the legume pod borer, Maruca testulalis Geyer (Lepidoptera Pyralidae), on two cowpea varieties in Nigeria
AB  - An experiment to examine the effects of four agrometeorological factors on population fluctuations in legume pod borer, Maruca testulalis (Geyer) in two cowpea varieties was carried out under field conditions in Ibadan, Nigeria. Plots, 5 X 10 m each, of cowpea varieties IT84S-2246-4 and Dan ilan were planted fortnightly between 5 May and 5 October 1988 (12 plantings in all for each variety). Three peaks of the pod borer populations were observed on the cowpeas. There were smaller peaks on crops planted between 5 May and 1 June and again between 29 June and 13 July and a larger one on those planted between 24 August and 7 September. These two peaks coincided with the peaks of the rainfall. Significant relationships were obtained between pod borer counts and (a) cumulative rainfall (R2 = 0.41; P = 0.004) (b) number of rainy days (R2 = 0.17; P = 0.04) from plant emergence to 50% flowering. These results suggest though, the distribution of rainfall over time is more crucial than the total amount in determining the fluctuations of pod borer populations. Thus, the adjustment of planting dates is suggested as an IPM tactic to avoid the development of damaging levels of pod borer infestations.

TI  - Phenology, monitoring, and control decision components of the grape berry moth (Lepidoptera Tortricdae) risk assessment program in New York
AB  - The average date and degree-day accumulation of peak egg deposition for each generation of grape berry moth, Endopiza viteana Clemens, during 1987 and 1988 are presented. Three generations were observed in 1987 but only two generations were observed in 1988. Egg deposition in 1988 was delayed on both a calendar and degree-day basis. Pheromone trap catch was an effective predictor of the temporal occurrence of grape berry moth egg deposition but was a poor indicator of the level or spatial distribution of larval damage. Action thresholds for initiating insecticide treatments of second-generation grape berry moth based on estimating population density during the 3rd wk in July were 17 and 3% damaged clusters for early- and late-harvested varieties, respectively. The operating characteristics of the currently recommended sampling procedure, consisting of two vineyard sites and 50 grape clusters inspected per site, was compared with a calculated optimal procedure. The optimal procedure required the same amount of sampling time as the currently recommended procedure and consisted of sampling five sites and 15 clusters per site. The optimal procedure performed better, but the difference between the two procedures was small. The results are discussed in the context of a risk-assessment approach for the management of the grape berry moth in New York State.

TI  - Survey methods, distribution, and seasonality of Korscheltellus gracilis (Lepidoptera Hepialidae) in the Green Mountains, Vermont
AB  - In 1983, large populations of Korscheltellus gracilis (Grote) were discovered in soil in the boreal zone of Camels Hump Mountain, Vt. A monitoring procedure was developed to evaluate population dynamics and abundance. The insect was most abundant at elevations of 1,000-1,150 m where red spruce and balsam fir grow and spruce decline is most evident. Flight occurs from late June through early August, and K. gracilis adults were trapped in 19 of 20 sites in the Green Mountain National Forest. They were significantly more abundant at high elevations and on even years.

TI  - European corn borer (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) moth captures in aerial water pan traps influenced by replacement of pheromone at different intervals
AB  - Aerial water pan pheromone traps were used to monitor flights of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), in two locations in South Dakota during 1987 and at three sites in Illinois in 1988. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of different pheromone septa replacement intervals on European corn borer moth captures in aerial water pan pheromone traps. At each location, four treatments were arranged in a randomized complete-block design. The treatments consisted of differing the length of time pheromone septa were allowed to remain in the water pan traps and were as follows (1) septa replaced weekly, (2) septa replaced biweekly (once every 2 wk), (3) septa replaced every 3 wk or monthly, and (4) traps used without septa. Results indicate that even when pheromone septa are changed very infrequently (3 wk to monthly), distinct flights of male European corn borer moths can be detected. Moth captures were generally greater in water pan traps in which septa were changed weekly; however, in many instances, no significant differences in trap catches occurred among the three pheromone replacement treatments. When European corn borer populations are very low, the length of time between pheromone septa replacement may not significantly affect the capture of male moths. Replacement of pheromone septa on a biweekly basis should work satisfactorily for a large-scale monitoring program where expense is a concern.

TI  - Mortality and height growth losses of coniferous seedlings damaged by the black army cutworm
AB  - Growth and survival of seedlings were determined for 1 to 3 years following defoliation by black army cutworm, Actebia fennica (Tausch.). Ten data sets were collected on three sites and included four species of seedlings interior Douglas-fir. Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco; lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Dougl.; western larch, Larix occidentalis Nutt.; and Engelmann spruce, Picea engelmannii Parry. Mortality following defoliation cannot be assessed until after the flush in the next growing season because completely defoliated seedlings often regenerate new foliage and survive. More than 90% of the total mortality that did occur was detected at that time. Mortality of up to 39% occurred when seedlings were defoliated more than 60%; most of this occurred when planting was carried out concurrent with defoliation. Synergistic root stress effects caused by poor planting, dry sites, or drought significantly increased mortality. Height growth was significantly reduced when defoliation was greater than 60%; the greatest effects occurred when terminal bud destruction accompanied needle loss. Growth losses were greatest the year of defoliation; recovery of height growth of lodgepole pine was complete by the 2nd year on good growing sites. On poor sites, retardation of lodgepole pine height growth was still evident after 3 years.

TI  - Mating status of tobacco budworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) males captured in pheromone traps compared with males and females collected at night by hand
AB  - Mating status of males of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), captured in pheromone traps was compared with that of males and females from nocturnal collections made by hand. The frequency of virgin males captured in traps before the mating period was similar seasonally and nightly to that of males collected by hand; thus, as far as mating status is concerned, males captured in traps appear to represent the insect population. However, pheromone traps did not capture males that had emerged or mated previously the same night. The frequency of virgin males decreased during the night but increased with season for both those collected by hand and in traps. The frequency of virgin males from trap capture cycled with peak frequencies occurring at the beginning of a population peak as determined by numbers of males trapped. Based upon the linear relationship between numbers of sperm bundles within the duplex and time, the average weekly age of virgin males also cycled over the duration of the study, ranging from 1 to 4 d. The oldest virgin males were trapped in the spring, just before the first population peak, which may indicate a spring influx of moths.

TI  - Evaluation of a pest advisory for corn earworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) infestations in soybean
AB  - Larval surveys of second-generation corn earworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie), taken in field corn in mid-July from 1976 to 1989 were used in a pest advisory program to predict potential for later infestations in Virginia soybeans. Estimates of statewide soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, acreage treated for corn earworm were used to evaluate survey predictions. Blacklight-trap and pheromone-trap moth catches from 1983 to 1989 were plotted to study trends in moth activity around soybean fields and to evaluate their use in the pest advisory. Total soybean acreage treated for corn earworm increased linearly with an increase in percent corn ears infested with corn earworm. Generally, <20% corn infestation resulted in <10% soybean acreage tested; a 20-35% infestation resulted in 28-35% acreage treated; and >35% infestation resulted in approximately 50% or more acreage treated. Corn earworm moth activity around soybean fields increased in late July to early August, peaked one time each season from 15 to 24 August, and ceased by mid- to late September. Pheromone traps provided timely detection of moths in individual fields; however, blacklight-trap catch was a better area-wide indicator of corn earworm infestation severity in soybeans.

TI  - Direct and interactive effects of planting date, irrigation, and corn earworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) damage on aflatoxin production in preharvest field corn
AB  - The influence of planting date, irrigation, and insect damage on aflatoxin production in field corn, Zea mays L., was evaluated in 1988 and 1989 at the Macon Ridge Branch of the Northeast Research Station, Winnsboro, La. Severe early season drought conditions were experienced in 1988, and four irrigations were necessary. The plots received excessive amounts of precipitation in 1989, and no irrigation was needed. The most damaging insect pest in both years was the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). A significant interaction between effects of planting date and irrigation on corn earworm damage was detected in 1988. A significant interaction between effects of planting date and insecticide treatment on corn earworm damage occurred in 1988 and 1989. Mean corn earworm damage to ears in plots that received insecticide applications was significantly lower compared with that in plots that did not receive insecticide applications in 1988 and 1989. A significant interaction between effects of irrigation and insecticide treatment on percentage of ears that displayed bright greenish-yellow fluorescence (BGYF) and aflatoxin B1 concentration occurred in 1988. The plots that received irrigation and were treated with insecticide had the lowest BGYF (1.1%) and geometric mean aflatoxin B1 concentration (0.06 parts per billion [ppb]). In the plots that did not receive irrigation and insecticide applications, a drastic increase in BGYF (43.8%) and aflatoxin B1 concentration (191.5 ppb) was observed. Geometric mean aflatoxin B1 concentrations for planting dates 1 and 2 (9.1 and 11.9 ppb, respectively) were significantly higher than the aflatoxin concentration in planting date 3 (2.4 ppb) in 1988. Only 5 of 720 ears observed exhibited BGYF in 1989, and no aflatoxin B1 was detected in any of the samples. Results of this experiment suggest that drought stress and corn earworm damage had a synergistic effect in enhancing aflatoxin levels in preharvest field corn.

TI  - A comparison of trapping techniques for mythimna convecta (walker) (lepidoptera noctuidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - Three trap types and 3 food lures were tested for their effectiveness in monitoring field populations of the common armyworm moth, Mythimna convecta (Walker). The traps comprised 1 UV light trap and 2 types of fermentation traps, namely a simple lure pail (lure pot'), into which the moths fell and drowned, and a cone trap built over a covered lure pot, the FE trap'. The food lures comprised diluted port wine and sugar, red wine and sugar, and a synthetic lure. There was no significant difference in the attractiveness of wine and port lures, while the synthetic lure did not catch any moths. A vehiclemounted net provided an independent measure of airborne density and species composition of the noctuid population at 1 study site. The light trap did not catch many M. convecta. The 2 types of fermentation trap caught similar numbers of M. convecta, although the FE trap had several advantages over the lure pot the dry moth catches were easier to recover; there was greater selectivity for M. convecta over other abundant noctuids, particularly Agrotis infusa (Boisduval); and the variation in nightly catches more accurately reflected those of the field populations of M. convecta, particularly those engaged in surface or trivial flight.

AB  - In New York state, there are three races of European corn borer moths, which are characterized principally by differences in voltinism and the sex pheromone communication system. One race is bivoltine, with females producing and males responding to a 991 E/Z isomeric ratio of delta 11-14 OAc's as the sex pheromone. Two races, one univoltine and one bivoltine, produce and respond to a 397 E/Z blend of delta 11-14 OAc's. The races are referred to as BE, UZ, and BZ to denote these differences. Analyses by gas chromatography of field-collected females indicate that there is significant hybridization between the Z and E races when in sympatry, with hybrid females producing a 6832 ratio of E/Z delta 11-14 OAc. Gene flow among the races was investigated using differences in triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) allozyme frequencies of moths from sites sampled across the state. The fixed nature of the Tpi-1 allele in the BE race and increases in the Tpi-1 allele frequencies in UZ populations in sympatry with the BE race support the hypothesis that gene flow following hybridization is unidirectional from BE populations into the Z populations. In addition, the TPI genotypes of the 10 hybrid females analyzed were consistent with hybridization occurring by E males mating with Z females.

TI  - Influence of winter cover crop suppression practices on seasonal abundance of armyworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), cover crop regrowth, and yield in no-till corn
AB  - Rye (Secale cereale L.), used as a winter cover crop, was killed by paraquat or by mowing with a bushog. In the early stages of subsequent no-till corn, abundance of armyworm, Pseudaletia unipuncta (Haworth), was lower in the mowed treatment compared with the sprayed treatment in three of five fields and did not differ in another field. Over the duration of the first armyworm generation, cumulative armyworm-days in the sprayed treatment were greater than in the mowed treatment in three of five fields and did not differ in another field. Mowing the cover crop was 40% less expensive than spraying. Competition from rye regrowth in the mowed treatment did not diminish yields. Corn silage yields were increased by mowing (P = 0.07), and the average increase in net benefit from mowing the cover crop compared with spraying was $91-113/ba. Cover crop mowing may be an economical and effective means of managing armyworm populations in no-till corn.

TI  - Insecticide resistance in spotted tentiform leafminer (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) mechanisms and management
AB  - Resistance to organophosphorous insecticides, pyrethroids, and methomyl occurred in populations of spotted tentiform leafminer, Phyllonorycter blancardella (F.), from southern Ontario. Resistance to organophosphorous insecticides occurred in all populations from commercial orchards. Resistance appeared to be due to an insensitive target acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Addition of several types of synergists to azinphosmethyl solutions did not affect toxicity. Resistance to methomyl appeared to be partially due to enhanced metabolism by aliesterases and partially to reduced inhibition of AChE. Selection for methomyl resistance was separate from resistance to organophosphorous insecticides. Increased activity of glutathione S-transferases was not implicated in resistance to either organophosphorous insecticides or methomyl. With current pest control practices, management of resistance to organophosphorous insecticides is not feasible in Ontario apple orchards. Resistant populations are regularly subjected to selection pressure by organophosphorous insecticides applied for control of other orchard pests. Pyrethroid resistance has been managed by modifications in the timing of applications to coincide with a predominance of the most sensitive life stages. Use of this strategy over three seasons has not resulted in detectably higher levels of resistance. Resistance to methomyl was relatively rare compared with organophosphorous or pyrethroid resistance. Methomyl resistance could be managed by strategies similar to those used for pyrethroids, i.e., modification of spray timing to coincide with the presence of early larval stages, or by restricted use. Where use was restricted for 3 yr after resistance was detected, resistance to methomyl declined from 9-fold to approximately 4.5-fold.

TI  - Influence of patch plant density on herbivory levels by Etiella zinckenella (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) on Glycine max and Crotalaria pallida
AB  - Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of the density and size of patches of soybeans (Glycine max (L.)) on the extent of pod damage by the lima bean pod-borer Etiella zinckenella (Treitschke). In addition, an evaluation was made of changes in rates of parasitism as a function of changes in patch characteristics. Low-density plots had a greater proportion of pod damage than did high-density plots. Plot size did not influence the proportion of pods attacked per plant. Larval parasitoids of E. zinckenella, in general, were not influenced by plant density but were influenced by host herbivore denisty. Other experiments were conducted to determine if mixtures of soybeans with a feral host, Crotalaria pallida Ait, a species in the Fabaceae, would influence damage by the pod borer or parasitism. No differences were observed between mixed species plots and pure C. pallida of pure soybean plots, in the number of E. zinckenella larvae per plant raceme nor in the level of parasitism. The abundance of pods produced by plants as a function of cultivar type, patch characteristics and time of season were also recorded.

TI  - Dispersal and survival of early instars of European corn borer (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in field corn
AB  - Cohorts of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), from eggs infested on whorl-stage corn (Zea mays L.), were intensively sampled through fourth instar in 1986 and through fifth instar in 1987. In both years, central plants in plots (4 by 2 m, 55 plants) were infested with European corn borer egg masses to simulate a first-generation infestation. In 1986, one egg mass was placed in each plot, whereas in 1987, plots received one, two, or four egg masses. In both years, >50% of the recovered larvae were on the infested plant. Mean dispersal distance increased linearly with time in both years. However, maximum dispersal distance was independent of time in both years. In 1987, egg mass density had a significant linear effect on maximum dispersal distance but no effect on mean dispersal distance. The radius encompassing 90% of the recovered larvae included the infested plant and two plants on either side within the same row. Mortality occurred mainly within the first 48 h 75.7% in 1986 and 82.9% in 1987. A logistic regression showed that egg and larval survival were independent of egg mass density. The number of tunnels produced per larva found at 8 d after infestation (considered equivalent to scouting) was 0.592. Knowledge of European corn borer dispersal and survival could be used to improve sampling plans and the calculation of economic thresholds.

TI  - Potential of Nosema spp. (Microspora, Nosematidae) and viruses in the management of Chilo spp. (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae)
AB  - Laboratory and field assays carried out so far indicate that microsporidian pathogens, especially Nosema spp., may be exploited for the management of the spotted stalk borer Chilo partellus and possibly other Chilo spp. Several formulations have been tested for the application of Nosema spores in the field for borer management. Significantly high levels of control were achieved when the pathogen was sprayed on plants infested with borer larvae, compared with unsprayed plots. Sublethal dosages of Nosema spp. reduced the biological performance of C. partellus, as indicated by reduced fecundity in infected females, high mortality in pre-imagines as well as in the filial generations, and reduced lifespan. There was also a high level of deformity in the surviving adults. Such debilitating factors would subsequently result in a reduction of population levels. In sugar-cane pests, granulosis viruses have been observed to cause high natural mortalities in C. infuscatellus and C. sacchariphagus. Field infestation has been reduced by the application of the virus. Further, the presence of polyhedrosis viruses in C. partellus, and Chilo iridiscent virus in C. suppressalis, points towards the possibility of using this group of pathogens in Chilo control.

TI  - Tobacco budworm (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) phenology of fall and summer diapausing and degree-day requirements for larval development and adult emergence
AB  - The annual diapause phenology, larval development, and adult emergence of tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), was studied under insectary conditions at Phoenix, Ariz., from August 1986 to September 1987. The percentage of pupae entering fall diapause peaked at approximately 97% on 16 November 1986 and remained high (near 80%) through February 1987. The percentage of pupae entering summer diapause reached a maximum of 51.7% on 19 July as mean daily temperatures increased to 30 degrees C. Moths emerging from nondiapausing and diapausing pupae contributed to major moth peaks in the fall (23 August to 1 December) and spring (1 April to 15 May) months. Very little moth emergence was observed from 15 December to 1 April. Larvae required an average of 10-88 d to complete development, depending on annual temperature and photophase fluctuations. Larval mortality (range, 1-93%) also was higly correlated with larval developmental time. Pupal developmental time varied greatly among cohorts nondiapause, 10-45 d; fall diapause, 40-190 d; and summer diapause, 28-105 d. Pupal mortality for fall diapause (43.5%) also was significantly higher than that of other pupae. Lower and upper temperature threshold for larval and pupal development, taken from the literature, were modified using coeficient of variation analyses of degree-day accumulations. Based on the coefficient of variation method, lower and upper thresholds for larvae, nondiapausing, fall-diapausing, and summer-diapausing pupae were 11.25-32.0, 12.8-34.0, 12.8-32.0, and 12.8-30.0 degrees C, respectively. Use of this information to develop a season-long model of H. virescens phenology is discussed.

TI  - Oviposition efficiency of the grey larch bud moth (zeiraphera diniana) on different substrates and its relevance to the population dynamics of the moth
AB  - Females of the grey larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) laid significantly more eggs on larch branches covered with naturally occurring Parmelia lichens than on branches without them. Numbers of eggs deposited and behaviour suggest that besides olfactory and mechanical stimuli from the antennae and the tarsi, thigmotactic stimuli perceived by the ovipositor play an important role for optimum oviposition. The fact that oviposition efficiency is reduced by 50% on larch branches from the lowland region of Europe where no lichens occur, is considered to be of importance for the determination of the fluctuations at low density in the lowland region.

TI  - A survey of cutworm attacks in England and Wales, and a descriptive population model for Agrotis segetum (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - Surveys of larval populations and numbers of reports of damage showed that from 1945 to 1978 Agrotis segetum was the commonest species of cutworm, causing most damage, to a wide range of crops, from July to October. Attacks varied in extent and severity between years, the most severe damage occurring in 1949 and in 1976. A model has been devised to estimate an index of larval survival to third instar, based on temperaturerate of development relationships and mortality due to daily rainfall. This survival index is highly correlated with yeartoyear changes in numbers of reported attacks by A. segetum. The model suggests that weather conditions alone were responsible for the last major cutworm outbreak in 1976.

TI  - Pink bollworm (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) field testing a new polyethylene tube dispenser for gossyplure
AB  - Gossyplure, a sex attractant for the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), was applied by hand on 5 June to 2-ha cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., fields using a polyethylene tube dispenser. Three doses were tested 64.4 g (AI)/ha in one application (=894 dispensers/ha), and totals of 66.9, or 31.2 g (AI)/ha divided into three applications of 22.3 or 10.4 g each, respectively, on a 31-day schedule. In addition, untreated and insecticide-treated blocks of cotton were included for comparison. Trap catches in gossyplure-treated fields averaged <1 moth per trap per night until 13 August, an average reduction in catch of 94-98% compared to untreated and insecticide-treated cotton. The field treated with three applications of 10.4 g each had a significantly greater number of larvae per ha in blooms than the other test fields during the 27 June-20 July observation period. Fields treated with 64.3 g, or three applications of 22.3 g each, had significantly lower boll infestations than the field treated with three applications of 10.4 g each or the untreated field in 6 and 13 August samples. Populations of pink bollworm were not detected in the insecticide-treated field until late August. Females in mating stations in gossypluretreated fields remained unmated through mid-August tests. Mating occurred in untreated and insecticide-treated fields on six of seven test dates. Tests of tube dispensers collected from fields during the test period indicated a half-life of ca. 58 days and a gossyplure emission rate of 1.03 mg/day and 0.35 mg/day for the first and last 10 days of that period.

TI  - Influence of delayed mating on egg production, egg viability, mating, and longevity of female pink bollworm (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)
AB  - Virgin female pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), were paired individually with a 2- to 3-d-old virgin male for one night at ages <1, 1, 5, 10, and 15 d from eclosion in lots of 25. Virgin females served as controls. Records were kept on numbers of eggs deposited daily, percentage hatch, and day of adult death. All dead females were dissected to determine mating status. When total females of each age group were considered, mating at the age of 5, 10, and 15 d resulted in significantly less mating, fewer eggs, less hatch, and fewer first-instar larvae than when mating occurred at the age of <1 and 1 d. Virgins lived significantly longer than females mated at <1, 1, and 5 d of age. Mating delays of 10 and 15 d resulted in longevities similar to that of virgins. Differences in mating and oviposition between treatments for mated and total females were statistically similar, and there were no significant differences in percentage hatch of eggs produced by mated females regardless of the female's age. These results suggest that one mating provided adequate sperm to fertilize available eggs. Mated females showed a marked oviposition response on the second night after mating. Generation increases established from previously reported field populations and compared with reproduction in the current study show that mating delays of 5 d or more could result in a 5-fold decrease in population density over four generations.

AB  - The rate of emergence of a field population of overwintering corn earworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie), and tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), was observed in the College Station, Tex., area. The population was manipulated into a state of diapause in the laboratory before being placed in individual artificial pupal chambers in a plot of bare soil. The temperature of the chambers was monitored hourly, and the chambers were inspected daily to determine whether emergence had occurred. A computer model was developed to simulate pupal developmental response during diapause and pupation based on hourly temperature over time. The predicted time of emergence using the model compared favorably with observed values from the field and the laboratory.

AB  - Ovarian dynamics indicate that the celery looper, Syngrapha falcifera (Kirby), does not overwinter in Iowa. Additionally, early spring population trends, ovarian dynamics, and associated weather patterns strongly imply that the celery looper is a migrant into the state. Estimated celery looper development requirements of 377 degree-days per generation with developmental thresholds of 8.3 degrees C minimum and 32.6 degrees C maximum were determined from field data by the least-variability method. Developmental requirements and ovarian dissections allowed the discrimination of four complete generations in 1984 through 1986.

TI  - Screening some Common Molecular Markers and a Desaturase Marker, Linked to Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis, in Three Z-Strain and an E-Strain Populations of the European Corn Borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, Occurring in Central Europe
AB  - The European corn borer moth, (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera Crambidae, Pyraustinae) is one of the most destructive pests of maize worldwide. ECB has two pheromone-strains, separated by specific ratios of isomers of E- and Z11-tetradecenyl acetates (E11- and Z11-14Ac), but appearing morphologically identical. Accordingly, E- and Z-ECB pheromone traps are available for the respective populations for practical monitoring of the flight, however, traps for Z-strain are unreliable for practical usage in some parts of Central-Europe. E- and Z-ECB populations occur in sympatry in some areas, while in allelopatry in other areas. Determining the strains before the flight of adults, when difference in the composition of their respective pheromones is manifested, would be of practical interest for early warning. In addition to the known fatty-acyl-reductase (FAR) marker, further markers would allow more comprehensive studies. We screened the following common markers for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA regions partial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), cytochrome B (CytB), the second spacer of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2), Elongation factor 1a (EF1a) and actin gene (Act). In addition, a marker of the 11-desaturase gene (11desat), linked to biosynthesis of female-produced sex pheromone, was also included, because we reported earlier a differential expression for this site. Three Z-ECB populations locating at distant sites within Hungary, an area where only Z-strain occurs, and an E-ECB population in Slovenia, known as the closest-occurring E-strain, were included into the study. Separate laboratory colonies were established from each population, and F1 generations were sampled to verify the identity of pheromone strains, by analysing the composition of sex pheromone by gas chromatography linked to an electroantennographic detector (GC-EAD). Molecular studies were conducted using specimens taken from the F2 generations. Results of genetic studies showed that there were no differences between the Z and E populations for the common markers. In contrast to this, several nucleic acid changes (11 nt in 4 positions) were found between the three Z-populations (Hungary) and the E-population (Slovenia) in the desaturase marker. Further study is required to reveal whether the differences found in this study are consistent across E-populations, thus making these markers suitable for diagnostic purposes.

TI  - The effect of biochar amendment to soils on Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) on rice
AB  - Biochar application to soils can alter soil nutrient dynamics and thus change the uptake of nutrients by plants. The effect of such changes on leaf-chewing caterpillars remains unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of biochar amendment at varying rates on the developmental and reproductive performances of the rice leaf-folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis on potted rice, and investigated C. medinalis population size over two years in a paddy field applied with biochar. We found that biochar amendment prolonged larval development, increased larval mortality, decreased mature larval body weight, lowered consumption of rice leaves, and reduced adult longevity of C. medinalis. We did not detect a difference in fecundity of the females that survived to adulthood among biochar treatment levels. The two-year paddy field experiment showed a reduced C. medinalis population as a consequence of biochar application in the first year, and a population similar to the control in the next year. The results from the current research suggest that biochar can impair C. medinalis development and may have a negative consequence on its populations.

TI  - Non-Randomness of Fluctuations in the European Corn Borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Hbn.) (Lepidoptera, Crambidae) Long-Term Population Dynamics in Krasnodar Territory
AB  - The paper presents the results of analysis of long-term (19942017) data on the population dynamics of the local bivoltine European corn borer population developing on maize in the east of Krasnodar Territory. The studied factors, namely the season, the generation within a season, and the development stage (eggs, newly hatched and IIIV instar larvae, pupae, adults, and egg-laying females), had highly significant effects on population dynamics. The time analysis of normalized deviations of logarithm densities of IIIV instar larvae from the mean values using wavelet decomposition revealed significant periodicity in the abundance fluctuations. Thus, our data radically differ from the commonly assumed sporadic nature of the population dynamics of Ostrinia nubilalis. Since the European corn borer has occurred on maize in Krasnodar Territory for at least 100 years, certain biocenotic control mechanisms significantly changing its population dynamics must have appeared during this time.

TI  - Species Composition and Population Dynamics of Dominant Dendrophagous Moths (Lepidoptera) in St. Petersburg and Its Environs
AB  - The paper summarizes new and literature data on the species composition, trophic relationships, and population dynamics of phyllophagous lepidopterans dominant on woody plants in St. Petersburg and its environs (Russia). Most of these species have concealed larvae (e.g., leaf miners and leaf rollers), and some of them are invasive. The data were accumulated during approximately a hundred years of observations and field collections. Concealed species form the dominant group within the studied complex of phyllophagous moths in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Province (27 species from 13 families). Changes in the composition of dominant pests of the dog rose, bird cherry, elm, poplar, and other woody plants have been recorded. Outbreaks of some species, such as Phyllonorycter salicicolella (Gracillariidae), Archips rosana (Tortricidae), Leucoma salicis, Lymantria monacha, and Orgyia antiqua (Erebidae), were recorded during the XX century but since about 1980 the population density of these species has remained at a very low level. Another group of species, which includes Phyllonorycter populifoliella (Gracillariidae), Batrachedra praeangusta (Batrachedridae), Acleris bergmanniana, and Epinotia abbreviana (Tortricidae), demonstrated a sharp increase in population density in the 19902000s, a phenomenon which had not been observed before. The possible causes of such population dynamics are discussed. The dominant species of phyllophagous micro-lepidopterans, including some recent invaders (e.g., Cameraria ohridella and Phyllonorycter issikii, Gracillariidae) and adventive species (e.g., Ph. populifoliella and Ph. acerifoliella, Gracillariidae) pose a serious threat to woody plants in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Province.

TI  - Tiger-Moths in Savannas in Eastern Amazon First Assessment of Diversity and Seasonal Aspects
AB  - Biodiversity knowledge on insects is urgently needed due to the ever growing demand for food and the consequent deforestation process and loss of natural habitats in many understudied tropical regions. In this paper, we describe the outcome of a biodiversity research on tiger moths performed for the first time in a poorly studied Amazonian landscapethe savanna. We sampled tiger moths monthly with UV automatic light traps for 12 consecutive months in two sampling points in an area of savanna in eastern Amazon, and we compared our results to previously available data for eastern Amazon. We found a total of 91 species of which 80 were identified to species level. The most species-rich subtribes were Phaegopterina and Euchromiina with 32 species each. Species richness and abundance did not differ among sampling sites, but in general the species richness was higher during the dry season while abundance was higher during the wet season. This seasonal diversity pattern differs from the most common patterns recorded for savannas in other parts of the world. The species composition also changed in wet and dry seasons and correlated significantly with temperature and relative humidity. Our results suggest that the alpha diversity of the Amazonian savannas in our sampling area is lower than that in nearby rain forests and similar to that in agriculturally disturbed areas surrounded by rain forests. However, the species composition differed considerably from natural and disturbed areas. These results highlight the need of basic biodiversity surveys of insects in Amazonian savannas.

TI  - Susceptibility and yield response to sugarcane borer (Lepidoptera Crambidae) infestation among sugarcanes and sorghums with potential for bioethanol production
AB  - The U.S. Gulf Coast has ideal conditions, including abundant rainfall and a long growing season, for production of dedicated bioenergy crops. Interest in producing bioethanol from high-biomass graminaceous crops including energycanes (Saccharum spp.) and energy sorghums (Sorghum spp. hybrids) in the region has increased. However, insect pests including the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.) (Lepidoptera Crambidae), will likely adversely affect bioenergy crops. The impact of D. saccharalis infestations on yields of conventional and bioenergy sugarcanes and sorghums was investigated in three separate field studies conducted from 2012 to 2013. These studies compared D. saccharalis injury and crop yield parameters among insecticide-protected and unprotected plots of sugarcanes, energycanes, high biomass sorghums, and sweet sorghum. In unprotected plots, D. saccharalis injury ranged from 2.9 (resistant sugarcane) to 13.6% bored internodes (susceptible sugarcane). A resistant energycane cultivar was among the least injured (3.5% bored internodes) and demonstrated the greatest potential for bioethanol production with an average of >17,000 L/ha. Linear regressions revealed negative relationships between percentage of bored internodes and ethanol yield in all cultivars. At one location, D. saccharalis injury resulted in a 13% reduction in bioethanol production across all years and cultivars. These studies indicate D. saccharalis has potential to substantially reduce yields in bioenergy crops and pest management programs will be needed to maximize ethanol production.

TI  - Changes in pattern of plant-insect interactions on the Persian ironwood (Parrotia persica, Hamamelidaceae) over the last 3 million years
AB  - The Hyrcanian forest is composed of many Arcto-Tertiary plant species that since the beginning of the Quaternary glaciations have decreased their distribution until they became endemic to the coasts of the Caspian Sea in the northern part of Iran. Today, the Hyrcanian forest is considered as the closest similar remnant of the Plio-Pleistocene European paleoforests. One of the most emblematic plant species is the Persian Ironwood (Parrotia persica C. A. Mey). This study presents the first comparison of plant-insect interaction patterns between modern samples from the current Persian Ironwood populations of the endemic species to the Hyrcanian forest and the fossil counterpart from Willershausen (Germany) and Bernasso (France). We wanted to know if the ecological relationships of P. persica with its environment were similar or changed during the last few millions of years, through the analysis of their plant-insect interaction. Fifteen sites were selected in the Hyrcanian forest along temperature and precipitation gradients. A total of 2160 leaves were collected, measured, and examined through some leaf characteristics and their plant-insect interactions. 84% of the leaves were damaged and a total of 3507 damage occurrences were found. A significant lower proportion of specialized damages were found on the leaves from P. persica in the Hyrcanian forest compared to what we observed among the samples from the two fossil outcrops, which could suggest a non-optimal environment for P. persica today in its current endemic distribution.

TI  - Can Saturniidae moths be bioindicators? Spatial and temporal distribution in the Brazilian savannah
AB  - Some moths species are considered good indicators of habitat quality because they are very responsive to human disturbance, vegetation type, and successional processes. However, Saturniidae moths have not yet been considered as indicators of environmental quality. Little is known on the distribution of moth species in different vegetation types and the moths seasonal variations in the Brazilian savannah. Therefore, this study aims to describe the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of moths belonging to the Saturniidae family in two vegetation typesCerrado sensu stricto on rocky outcrops and semi-deciduous forestin both the rainy and dry seasons. It addresses the influence of the climatic seasons and vegetation types on abundance, richness, and species composition to describe the temporal and spatial distribution patterns and the relationship between the ecological aspects and the life history of these moths. This study was conducted in the Cerrado phytogeographical domain, in Pireneus State Park, Gois, Brazil. The results revealed that most Saturniidae species sampled are present during the rainy season and typically found in forest habitats. Furthermore, a clear positive connection was found between the abundance pattern and rainfall seasonality and humid habitats; this is apparently related to the physiological tolerance of these moths, due to rudimentary mouthparts during their adulthood. Thus, rainfall and a forest habitat are important to and fundamental requirements for the persistence of the Saturniidae species in the Cerrado domain. Based on the results of this study, we suggest the use of saturniid species as indicators of changes in vegetation and climatic conditions.

TI  - Long-term stability of the hawkmoth fauna (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) in a protected area of Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest
AB  - Hawkmoths are an important component of tropical ecosystems, with significant roles as herbivores and pollinators. These moths can be used as indicators in biodiversity assessments because they can be easily sampled and identified. However, hawkmoths have seldom been surveyed over the long term for this purpose, especially in the Neotropical region. Considering that long-term datasets are of indisputable importance for understanding and monitoring temporal changes in biodiversity, this study assessed long-term changes in the hawkmoth fauna in a protected Atlantic Rain Forest area over a period of 64 years. We used historical and recent empirical datasets to ask whether faunal-diversity patterns and species composition have changed over time. We used individual- and sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves based on Hill number (diversity order of q = 0) to compare species richness, and the probability version of the abundance-based Chao-Jaccard index to assess beta diversity over time. To assess changes in faunal composition, we conducted a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis and performed an analysis of similarities to test whether the community composition has changed. Our results clearly showed long-term stability of the hawkmoth community over the 64 years, despite the growing human-induced landscape changes that occurred in the region surrounding the study area during the last 6 decades. This study emphasizes the importance of large remnants of Atlantic Forest for long-term maintenance of both functional diversity and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Factors affecting catch of the black-headed caterpillar, Opisina arenosella Walker in sex pheromone-baited traps and evidence for population suppression by mass trapping
AB  - The black-headed caterpillar, Opisina arenosella Walker (Lepidoptera Oecophoridae) is a major and most destructive pest of coconut palm. Feeding habit and spatially segregated distribution with a discrete flight period of 32.44A AA 4.45 (MeanA AA SD) days per generation make it difficult to employ insecticide sprays. In this study, we explored the utility of sex pheromone by exploiting its distribution and flight behaviour. The pheromone trap colour, its suspended height, density and design were evaluated. White cross-vane traps suspended in the middle of the palm canopy at a density of 40a120 traps haaA1 proved to be the most effective among tested. White cross-vane traps baited with synthetic pheromone, (Z,Z,Z)-3,6,9-Tricosatriene for three consecutive moth emergence periods and trapped 1,34,084, 9012 and 4126 moths in Nittur, Nelamangala and Bidadi, respectively. Further, there was a reduction in larvae per leaflet from 2.28, 1.17 and 0.83, to 0.11, 0.12 and 0.06, in the three respective sites. There was subtle to no change in the larval abundance in the control plots across the generations. Our results suggest suitable mass trapping technique may substantially suppress the O. arenosella population on coconut.

TI  - Contribution to the Microlepidoptera Fauna of the South of Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Republic of Khakassia
AB  - This paper provides a list of 125 species from 22 families of Microlepidoptera collected in the south of Krasnoyarsk Territory and in the Republic ofKhakassia, with 63 species (50%) and 2 families (Bucculatricidae and Elachistidae) recorded in the region for the first time, and 11 species from 6 families being new to Siberia Cauchas fibulella, Nemophora fasciella, N. minimella (Adelidae), Phyllonorycter sorbicola, Phyllocnistis extrematrix (Gracillariidae), Cosmiotes freyerella, Elachista subocellea (Elachistidae), Caryocolum alsinella, Scrobipalpula diffluella (Gelechiidae), Agonopterix intersecta (Depressariidae), and Ypsolopha horridella (Ypsolophidae). Three species are new to science Phyllonorycter sp. and Phyllocnistis verae (Gracillariidae) from the suburbs of Krasnoyarsk and Chrysoesthia sp. (Gelechiidae) from the Republic of Khakassia. Almost half of the faunistic findings belong to two families, Gelechiidae (34 species) and Gracillariidae (24 species). In the former family, the number of species distributed in Krasnoyarsk Territory and/or Khakassia was increased by 1.5 times based on our collection. Trophic specialization remains unknown only for 7 of the 125 species. Most (90%) of the remaining 118 species are phytophagous, the others are saprophagous; 53 species are known as leaf miners. Phytophagous species feed on plants of 36 families and 21 orders. The largest number of microlepidopteran species inhabit plants of the orders Rosales and Fagales (25 and 24 species, respectively). Twelve species are known as pests Tineidae (4 species), Gracillariidae, Gelechiidae (2 species in each), Argyresthiidae, Choreutidae, Lyonetiidae, and Plutellidae (one species in each). Four pest species have expanded beyond the Palaearctic in the last century Choreutis pariana (Choreutidae), Scrobipalpa atriplicella (Gelechiidae), Plutella xylostella (Plutellidae), and Niditinea fuscella (Tineidae).

TI  - Resistance of saccharum spp. against chilo sacchariphagus indicus (kapur) (lepidoptera crambidae) in india
AB  - Accessions of four Saccharum spp. from the world collection of sugarcane germplasm maintained at the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute Research Center, Kannur, Kerala State, India, were screened against Chilo sacchariphagus indicus (Kapur) (Lepidoptera Crambidae), commonly known as internode borer. Observations on the progression of borer attack in the most susceptible Saccharum officinarum indicated that the incidence began in the first fortnight of July, increased in the next 2 months and reached its peak in September. Thereafter, the incidence decreased in the next 2 months but reached its overall peak in December. Simple correlation coefficients between mean monthly weather parameters and borer incidence were not significant. Percent of canes attacked was significantly lower in 2011 than in 2012 for S. officinarum, Saccharum barberi and Saccharum sinense but did not differ between the years for Saccharum robustum. Amongst the four Saccharum spp., S. robustum showed the lowest borer incidence whereas S. officinarum recorded the lowest attack intensity. Whilst infestation index showed the same trend as percent canes attacked, percent deadhearts did not differ amongst the four Saccharum spp. Considering the 171 accessions evaluated, 29 (16.9%) accessions were resistant, 39 (22.8%) moderately resistant and 103 (60.2%) susceptible to internode borer. Out of the 39 accessions of S. officinarum, none occupied the resistant category whereas 17.9% were in the moderately resistant category. In S. robustum, whilst nearly half (44.5%) the accessions emerged as resistant, a considerable number occupied the moderately resistant category. In S. barberi, no accession was resistant to the borer. In S. sinense, only one accession each represented resistant and moderately resistant categories. Plant morphological characters, yield and quality parameters did not show clear-cut relationship with the three infestation parameters.

TI  - Phenological patterns of Spodoptera Guenee, 1852 (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) is more affected by ENSO than seasonal factors and host plant availability in a Brazilian Savanna
AB  - The identification of factors responsible for the population dynamics is fundamental for pest management, since losses can reach 18% of annual production. Besides regular seasonal environmental factors and crop managements, additional supra-annual meteorological phenomena can also affect population dynamics, although its relevance has been rarely investigated. Among crop pests, Spodoptera stands out due to its worldwide distribution, high degree of polyphagy, thus causing damages in several crops in the world. Aiming to distinguish the relevance of different factors shaping population dynamics of Spodoptera in an ecosystem constituted of dry and rainy seasons, the current study used circular statistics to identify phenological patterns and test if its population fluctuation is driven by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect, seasonal meteorological parameters, and/or host plant availability. Samplings were done in an intercropping system, in the Brazilian Savanna, during the new moon cycles between July/2013 and June/2016. Species were recorded all year round, but demonstrated differently non-uniform distribution, being concentrated in different seasons of the year. Population fluctuations were mostly affected by the ENSO intensity, despite the contrasting seasonal meteorological variation or host plant availability in a 400-m radius. Studies involving the observation of supra-annual phenomena, although rare, reach similar conclusions in relation to Neotropical insect fauna. Therefore, it is paramount to have long-term sampling studies to obtain a more precise response of the pest populations towards the agroecosystem conditions.

TI  - Comparison of Attraction and Trapping Capabilities of Bucket- and Delta-Style Traps With Different Pheromone Emission Rates for Gypsy Moths (Lepidoptera Erebidae) Implications for Understanding Range of Attraction and Utility in Surveillance
AB  - Delta- and bucket-style (Universal or Unitrap) traps baited with 1 standard survey lure and 1/3 and 3 lures were compared for their attractiveness and trapping efficiencies for gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera Erebidae), males. With bucket traps, the numbers of males attracted to within 2 m of traps and the proportion of these actually captured were identical among the three doses although the percentage of attracted males actually captured in bucket traps was low, less than 15%. A three-lure delta trap attracted about 70% more males than traps with the two lower doses. Capture efficiencies were above 80% for 1/3- and one-lure traps and about 60% for traps baited with three lures. The number of males captured in delta traps was equivalent for the three doses although our observations also suggest that a delta trap baited with three lures drew males from a wider range than lower dose lures and therefore would be a more sensitive trap for detecting incipient populations. We also noted that males tended to arrive in clusters, suggesting that attraction over moderate distances requires periods when the wind direction is fairly constant. This observation coupled with the great variability in the direction of male arrival to the traps also suggests that important changes in the area of influence of the plume are driven in such forested areas by slower but greater changes in wind direction compared with open habitats.

TI  - Salvage logging of mountain birch after geometrid outbreaks Ecological context determines management outcomes
AB  - Outbreaks of pest insects occasionally cause mortality of entire forest stands. Salvage logging of affected stands is the most common management response to such events. Logging may aid stand recovery by increasing the production and establishment of saplings, or stimulating the production of basal sprouts in sprouting tree species. However, the outcome of logging may depend on the ecological context in which it is implemented, with both herbivory and local growing conditions being potentially important factors. We conducted a field experiment to assess how logging affects recovery by saplings and sprouts in stands of mountain birch that have been damaged by outbreaks of geometrid moths. The study was conducted at the two locations Luftjok and Bugyfjord in subarctic Norway, where moth outbreaks have caused widespread mortality of mountain birch during the last two decades. Logging generally caused a strong increase in the production of basal sprouts, and also improved sprout growth in Luftjok, resulting in a substantial production of new stems in the logging plots at this location within the six-year period of the study. In Bugyfjord, sprout growth was retarded in logging plots compared to controls, resulting in complete failure to produce new stems during the study period. This appears to have been caused by ungulate browsing, possibly in interaction with regional, geologically determined, gradients in growing conditions. The outcome of logging also depended on local site quality, with limited sprouting occuring in rich meadow type stands, which traditionally have been assumed to have low capacity for sprout production. Birch saplings were less abundant in logging plots than in controls by the end of the study, especially in Bugyfjord, suggesting that logging did not improve sapling production. We conclude that logging may stimulate damaged mountain birch stands to recover by means of basal sprouting, but that the positive effects of logging may be reduced by browsing in some areas. Logging should also be practiced with care in rich meadow type stands, which have limited capacity for sprouting.

TI  - Annual Capture of Two Elachistidae Moth Species Using Stenoma catenifer Sex Pheromone in Criollo Avocado (Persea americana) at Chiapas, Mexico
AB  - Native varieties of avocado (Persea americana Mill) called aCriolloa grow in Mexico, but little is known of their association with the seed borer moth, Stenoma catenifer (Walsingham). S. catenifer is the best-known pest of aHassa avocado fruit. The S. catenifer sex pheromone was used to capture male S. catenifer in Criollo avocado orchards at different elevations at Chiapas, Mexico from September 2012 to August 2013. Polynomial regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between numbers of moths caught and weather factors (precipitation and temperature). We thought temperature and precipitation might affect the moths captured. Initial S. catenifer captures coincided with crop flowering and presence of avocado fruit, independently of the altitude at the site. S. catenifer was caught frequently at the low-altitude site from December to January, while captures increased from February to May at higher altitude. Moths captured and precipitation were positively correlated at the low-altitude site; moths captured were correlated with temperature but not with rainfall at the high-altitude site. As expected, S. catenifer pheromone also attracted Antaeotricha nictitans (Zeller) in the avocado crop. Interestingly, A. nictitans was captured in all seasons, even in larger numbers than S. catenifer. A new unidentified moth species in the Elachistidae family was present from late May to 10 July and was more abundant at Site 2.

TI  - Mating disruption of Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in a storage facility Spatio-temporal distribution changed after long-term application
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the application of mating disruption (MD) for stored-product Pyralidae in a large storage facility of amylaceous products in central Greece. Dispensers were placed in late 2010 until fall 2015, and the stored-product Pyralidae populations were monitored by using pheromone-baited sticky traps and Petri dishes containing semolina were used as oviposition traps. The infesting species that was found was the Mediterranean flour moth, E. kuehniella (Zeller). After the application of MD, the numbers of adult males found on the pheromone-baited traps were reduced in the MD-treated facility, as compared with the untreated (UTC), no MD, facility. Similarly, the numbers of larvae in the oviposition traps were also reduced, as compared with the UTC facility. During the successive years of MD deployment, there was a noticeable decrease in the number of Ephestia kuehniella male adults in the MD-treated facility, but the high density areas, and the infestation foci, were different among years. Hence, in 2014, the majority of the male adults were found at the areas where some years earlier, during the beginning of MD, there were no individuals, or their numbers were low. This suggests that, despite the effectiveness of the method, may be a spatial displacement to other areas. This fact could eventually alter the monitoring protocol, as new infestation foci may occur.

TI  - Influence of CO2 and Temperature on Metabolism and Development of Helicoverpa armigera (Noctuidae Lepidoptera)
AB  - Climate change will have a major bearing on survival and development of insects as a result of increase in CO2 and temperature. Therefore, we studied the direct effects of CO2 and temperature on larval development and metabolism in cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). The larvae were reared under a range of CO2 (350, 550, and 750 ppm) and temperature (15, 25, 35, and 45'C) regimes on artificial diet. Elevated CO2 negatively affected the larval survival, larval weight, larval period, pupation, and adult emergence, but showed a positive effect on pupal weight, pupal period, and fecundity. Increase in temperature exhibited a negative effect on larval survival, larval period, pupal weights, and pupal period, but a positive effect on larval growth. Pupation and adult emergence were optimum at 25'C. Elevated CO2 and temperature increased food consumption and metabolism of larvae by enhancing the activity of midgut proteases, carbohydrases (amylase and cellulase), and mitochondrial enzymes and therefore may cause more damage to crop production. Elevated CO2 and global warming will affect insect growth and development, which will change the interactions between the insect pests and their crop hosts. Therefore, there is need to gain an understanding of these interactions to develop strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change.

TI  - Wing wear and body size measurements of adult spruce budworms captured at light traps inference on seasonal patterns related to reproduction
AB  - Adult spruce budworms, Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), were captured at light traps in New Brunswick (NB) in 2012, Qubec (QC) in 2013, and Newfoundland (NL) in 2014; population densities were low in NBNL, and moderate in QC. Morphological parameters (wing score index, wing length, dry weight, residual fecundity) were estimated for thousands of adults. A very large number of budworms were captured during the night of 1516 July 2013. The heavy weight and low proportion of eggs laid by these females suggest a synchronized, pulsed emergence of local adults rather than mass immigration. Variation in sex ratio and adult morphology suggest that populations were closed at all locations (resident mothsimmigrants), as indicated by an increasing proportion of females over time (protandrous emergence) and declining weight over time (reflective of the ageing of adults). The small size of adults in QC relative to NBNL suggests that inverse-density-dependent fecundity affects population dynamics early in the transition between endemic and epidemic phases. Wing wear provides a useful proxy for the age of adults individuals with fresh wings (limited wear) were heavier than those with damaged wings, which likely reflects the metabolic costs of survival and (for females) the accruing proportion of eggs laid over time.

TI  - Fecundity of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera Notodontidae) at the southern edge of its distribution range
AB  - Analysis of annual and plot variations of egg batches number of Thaumetopoea pityocampa at the southern limit of its distribution area and in Pinus halepensis afforestations situated in the Algerian sub-Saharan region showed that its fecundity depends on the density of its population, plots, years and interaction of plots-years. It appears that the high average abundance of egg batches/trees during the outbreak period of this pest insect exceeds 24. The real fecundity is the lowest in the Mediterranean Basin and suggests that local adaptation can occur. The low fecundity is not an obstacle to caterpillar survival under different selection pressures. It is compensated by merging of colonies during the larval cycle. Moreover, in this study we noted a significant correlation between the number of eggs and the size of egg batches deposited on needles or around small pine branches. Size of egg batches is also intimately linked to the length of adult female forewings, fresh weight of females and weight of their pupae. Females with a biennial cycle have a low potential fecundity compared to those with an annual one.

TI  - Accumulation and Excretion of Cadmium in Three Successive Generations of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) and Impact on the Population Increase
AB  - Nowadays, heavy metal pollution has become more and more serious. Cadmium is one of the heavy metals that have caused serious pollution. Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), one of important agricultural pests, has broken out more frequently in recent years. In this study, accumulation at different developmental stages and excretion of Cd were detected, and effect of cadmium (Cd concentrations were 0.2, 0.8, 3.2, 12.8, and 51.2 mg/kg, respectively) on three successive generations of beet armyworm was also studied using life table in the laboratory. Results showed that Cd2+ contents were significantly different when S. exigua was reared under different Cd2+ concentrations in the same generation in a significant dosedependent manner. The concentration of Cd2+ increased with extension of stress time. Cd2 + concentration at different developmental stages was different, that is, larvae > pupa > adult. After emergence, Cd2+ concentration in both females and males decreased gradually, but that in paired adults decreased to a greater extent than that in unpaired ones. Beet armyworm could excrete heavy metals by means of faeces, prepupa exuviate, and puparium. Life table of the laboratory population was constructed, which showed that low doses of cadmium promoted the increase of population, whereas high doses inhibited the increase, meanwhile, with the extension of exposure length, the index of population trend (I) declined more rapidly. The study might provide references for the long-term and objective assessment of heavy metal pollution and its effect on the populations of important agricultural pests.

TI  - Mating disruption of pea moth (Cydia nigricana) in organic peas (Pisum sativum)
AB  - We appraised mating disruption (MD) to control pea moth, Cydia nigricana (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), by assessing male attraction to monitor traps, larval pod infestation, and larval age structure in pheromonetreated and untreated grain pea fields [Pisum sativum L. (Fabaceae)], over a 5year period. Cellulose pheromone dispensers were manually attached to the top shoots of pea plants and released 540 mg ha1 day1synthetic pheromone E8,E10dodecadien1yl acetate in a first test series (20002001) and ca. 4 200 mg pheromone ha1 day1in a second series (20042006). The dispensers had a halflife of about 30 days. Although male attraction to pheromone monitoring traps was largely suppressed at the edges and within MD fields in both test series, MD treatments did not reduce pod infestation in the open field in 2000 and 2001. In the 20042006 series, larval damage reduction was achieved in the majority of the trials but overall MD efficacy in the open field was only 61% and not significant. In contrast, in field cages placed within the experimental sites and supplied with unmated pea moths, MD control was consistently high and significant. There were no obvious differences in the larval age distribution in all MD and control treatments, suggesting that infestations started and developed further similarly. As a univoltine species, C. nigricana larvae stay in the soil of pea fields for hibernation and pupate. The following year, emerging adults disperse and fly to the closest pea crop. Combined emergence site and pea crop treatments were conducted over 2 years to include this early migration phase of C. nigricana adults. However, the emergence site treatments did not enhance MDcontrol efficacy. We conclude that mating activity was only prevented in cage tests, whereas substantial mating occurred during the transit phase outside the pheromonetreated fields either within noncrop vegetation and/or at the edges of pheromonetreated pea fields orientated upwind. Thus, resulting gravid female entry can be regarded as the major constraint to reliable MD control.

TI  - Solving the puzzle of Pringleophaga threatened, keystone detritivores in the subAntarctic [electronic resource]
AB  - In the globally significant, lowland terrestrial systems of the subAntarctic's South Indian Ocean Province Islands, caterpillars of the flightless moth genus Pringleophaga (Lepidoptera Tineidae) are typically responsible for much nutrient turnover. On Marion Island, Pringleophaga marioni is a keystone species for this reason. Rising temperatures have led to increasing populations of introduced house mice, which, in turn, feed extensively on Pringleophaga caterpillars. Because of the caterpillars keystone role, predation by mice is leading to changes in the functioning of the terrestrial system. Given the estimates of an extended life cycle duration for P. marioni (and its congeners), that is, two to more than 5 years, an ongoing puzzle is why the species has not shown greater population declines on Marion Island than have been recorded (in some habitats 4097% in 20 years), given extremely high estimates of predation (c. 1% of standing biomass per day). One reason may be inaccurate previous estimates of life cycle duration for the species. Here, we provide a new, quantitative estimate, by rearing caterpillars at different temperature regimes (5, 10, 15 and 515 'C), and combining these results with additional data from a prior study, to demonstrate that the life cycle duration for this species is approximately 1 year half the previous minimum estimate. The new quantitative data provide grounds for improved models for estimating population persistence of this species, and information for models assessing the costs and benefits of conservation interventions such as the eradication of invasive house mice.

TI  - Preparing the way for sterile insect release Determination of false codling moth distribution across a landscape mosaic
AB  - Sterile insect release (SIR) for control of insect pests focuses on release of sterile individuals within the focal crop. Its success is related to the extent to which pest individuals are concentrated in the crop or spread out across the landscape mosaic. However, little is known of the success of SIR relative to spatial densities of target insect pest populations. This is especially so for the false codling moth (FCM) Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), an indigenous moth to Africa and one of considerable phytosanitary significance. The aim here was to establish densities of the moth across a citrus production landscape in South Africa where the pest is particularly significant. Pheromone-baited delta traps were laid out in transects across a commercially important citrus-producing valley to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of wild males, prior to implementation of a commercial SIR programme. Transects included the focal citrus orchards, while also including a range of natural habitat types and elevation gradients. Male FCM were mostly confined to the citrus orchards, while those outside were close to citrus orchards or in alien alternative host plant patches, with only a few male individuals being caught up to 1.5 km from the nearest orchard. This suggests that the indigenous vegetation is supporting only a low FCM population, while, in contrast, citrus orchards are the main reservoir for FCM populations. These findings emphasize the importance of focussing SIR for FCM within the crop and on other, adjacent alien host plants, and not to dissipate releases into the surrounding and extensive natural vegetation.

TI  - Light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) colonization of California [electronic resource]
AB  - In response to the confirmed detection of the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana, in California, approximately 53,000 pheromone-baited Jackson traps were deployed and more than 246,000 males were caught (February 2007February 2010). Approximately 46,000 manually entered catch records were corrected for errors and converted into catch per trap per day. As empty trap data (zeros) were not recorded, we added zeros between first and last catch for each trap based on the stated servicing period (~30,000), before analyzing for trends. Residual data error rate was estimated as 1.5 %. San Francisco and Santa Cruz counties had relatively high trap catches immediately upon trap set, and remained the leading population centers, while most other counties showed a more general trend of a slow build-up in catch over time (12 counties). An exponential increase in trap catch was observed in four counties with sufficient data. The pattern of spread indicated natural, as well as anthropogenic-assisted spread rates, with populations appearing well ahead of the invasion front. This jump dispersal is probably due to movement of host plants, unsurprising since eggs of this polyphagous moth are readily laid on foliage. There was evidence of seasonality in spread, probably linked to the phenology of the insect. There was a positive relationship between catch and known host tree preference, suggesting that trap placement in preferred hosts could add sensitivity to future surveys. Recommendations include the improved provision of data acquisition by telecommunications, standardization of data input, more archiving, and frequent analysis of trap catches. The rapid rate of population growth demonstrated in two counties and spread across many others supports the hypothesis of the recent arrival of E. postvittana in California.

TI  - RESISTANCE AMONG CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER GERMPLASM TO THE BANDED SUNFLOWER MOTH (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) IN THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS / RESISTENCIA DE GERMOPLASMA DE GIRASOL CULTIVADO A LOS ATAQUES DE POLILLA (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) EN LAS GRANDES PLANICIES DEL NORTE / RSISTANCE DE SOUCHES DE TOURNESOL CULTIVES LA COCHYLIS RAYE (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) DANS LES GRANDES PLAINES NORDIQUES [electronic resource]
AB  - A five year field trial evaluated 71 oilseed sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., accessions, 32 breeding lines, and 25 interspecific crosses for resistance to infestation by naturally occurring populations of the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes Walsingham (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), in North Dakota. Germplasm with resistance to attack by the banded sunflower moth and subsequent larval feeding damage in the seeds was identified. PI 251902 had less than 10% feeding damage per head in all five years of testing and less than 6% in three of the five years. PI 372259 and PI 170401 exhibited 12% or less seed damage in three years of evaluation and PI 253776 had only 3% damage in two of the three years and was the least damaged in 2004. Four other accessions (PI 170385, PI 291403, PI 494859, and PI 505651) revealed resistance in three of five years. A number of the interspecific crosses which were retested based on earlier results showed reduced seed damage in 2003, but subsequently exhibited much greater damage the following year due to higher populations of banded sunflower moth. Hybrid 894 was earlier used by others as a susceptible check; however, in the current investigation, this hybrid consistently had the lowest average seed damage from C. hospes feeding among the germplasm evaluated. Results from this investigation indicate that there is potential for developing resistant genotypes with reduced feeding injury that will help sunflower producers reduce yield loss due to the banded sunflower moth. In addition, plant resistance can effectively be combined with delayed planting to decrease densities of C. hospes, thus reducing crop losses without disrupting the control of the larvae by parasitoids. Un essai en champ durant cinq ans a permis d'valuer 71 varits de tournesol huile (Helianthus annuus L.), 32 lignes de slection et 25 croisements interspcifiques pour la rsistance l'infestation naturelle par les populations de cochylis raye du tournesol, (Cochylis hospes) Walsingham (lpidoptre, Tortricidae) dans le Nord Dakota. Suite l'attaque par la cochylis raye, son dveloppement et l'alimentation des larves, des gnotypes rsistants ont t identifis. Le gnotype PI 251902 a subi moins de 10% d'attaques par plante pour chacune des cinq annes de l'essai et moins de 6% trois annes sur cinq. PI 372259 et PI 170401 ont eu 12% ou moins de dgts sur les graines en trois ans d'valuation, PI 253776 seulement 3% deux ans sur trois et tait le moins touch en 2004. Quatre autres accessions ( PI 170385, PI 291403, PI 494859 et PI 505651) ont rvl une rsistance trois annes sur cinq. Dans un certain nombre de croisements interspcifiques, retests sur la base de rsultats prcdents, les dommages sur les graines ont t limits en 2003 mais beaucoup plus importants l'anne suivante en raison d'une forte prsence de populations de cochylis raye du tournesol. L'hybride 894 avait t utilis dans des tudes antrieures comme tmoin de sensibilit ; cependant, dans la prsente exprimentation, cet hybride a t l'un des moins endommags parmi le matriel gntique valu. Les rsultats indiquent qu'il y a des possibilits pour dvelopper des gnotypes rsistants avec de faibles blessures conscutives l'alimentation du parasite, ce qui aidera les producteurs de tournesol rduire la perte de rendement due la cochylis raye. En outre, la tolrance des plantes peut efficacement tre combine avec un semis dcal afin de diminuer la densit de population de Cochylis hospes, rduisant de ce fait les pertes de rcolte sans perturber le contrle des larves par les pesticides.

TI  - Comparative performance of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on various host plants [electronic resource]
AB  - The effect of various host plants; chickpea (varieties Arman, Hashem, Azad and Binivich), bean varieties (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), common bean (Khomein), white kidney bean (Dehghan), red kidney bean (Goli), cowpea (variety Mashhad) and tomato (variety Meshkin) on the life table parameters of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) were evaluated under laboratory conditions (25 1 'C, 65 5 % RH and a 168 h lightdark photoperiod). Records for larval period, pupal period, and development time of H. armigera were longest on tomato (24.9, 15.1, and 45.4 days, respectively) and shortest on chickpea Arman (17.5, 9.1, and 31.7 days, respectively). Among various host plants fecundity (total number of eggs laid per female) was highest (2,665 eggs) on chickpea Arman and the lowest (700 eggs) on tomato. The net reproductive rate (R ) was significantly affected by various host plants being highest on chickpea Arman (1,422) and lowest on tomato (111.3 females/female/generation). The highest and lowest intrinsic rates of natural increase (r ) were observed on chickpea Arman (0.244 day) and tomato (0.123 day) varieties, respectively. Cluster analysis of the life table parameters of H. armigera on various host plants indicated that tomato, in comparison to other plants was an unsuitable host to H. armigera.

TI  - What we know and do not know about moth diversity from seven-year-monitoring in Mt. Jirisan National Park, South Korea
AB  - We sampled macromoths from 2005 to 2011 at six sites in Mt. Jirisan National Park (JNP), the oldest and largest national park in South Korea, to address the following questions (1) what is the total macromoth species richness of JNP and can the total moth species richness be estimated after 7-years? (2) What is the proportion of moth families and is this pattern of family dominance similar to that seen in other areas? (3) What are the yearly and monthly patterns of macromoth richness? In total, 24,890 individuals belonging to 948 species of 14 families of macrolepidoptera were collected. An estimated species number of 1096 was calculated using the Chao 1 estimator. A rank abundance plot showed a typical log-normal distribution. The proportions of dominant families were similar to those reported in temperate and tropical moth fauna studies Noctuidae was the most species-rich taxon, followed by Geometridae, Erebidae, Notodontidae, Drepanidae, and Sphingidae. Overall species richness and abundance were greatest in June, but the patterns of species richness and abundance varied by season and site. Within years, patterns of species richness were correlated with phenology but not the proximity of sites to one another in JNP. We provide various hypotheses to explain the high moth diversity in JNP, and future perspectives based on the results of our 7-year moth monitoring study.

TI  - The growing abundance of Helicoverpa armigera in Hungary and its areal shift estimation [electronic resource]
AB  - The invasive Cotton Bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hbner, Lepidoptera Noctuidae) has become a serious pest of several agricultural plants since its first mass occurrence in Hungary (1993). During the decades of the species presence in the Carpathian Basin, a remarkable fluctuation was detected in its abundance and flight phenology. We analysed long term light trap records and meteorological data to identify the possible factors behind these fluctuations. This study presents an overview of the areal dispersion and the rate of accumulation and flight phenology of this invasive pest, from its first Hungarian mass occurrence until the present, focusing on the influence of climatic factors on the Hungarian distribution of H. armigera. According to our estimation, this pest occupied 94% of the area of Hungary within eight years. There were significant differences in pest pressure by regions, corroborated by the average number of trapped specimens and the regression coefficients. Fluctuations of specimen numbers in the different years are clearly visible in the flight phenology diagrams, which depend on the rate of the growing abundance. The results indicate that abiotic elements may also play a significant role in the areal dispersion of this important invasive insect.

TI  - Effects of climate and density-dependent factors on population dynamics of the pine processionary moth in the Southern Alps [electronic resource]
AB  - Forest pest populations can fluctuate dramatically in relation to climate and density-dependent factors. Although the distributional range of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera Notodontidae) appears to be expanding northward and upslope with climate warming, the relative importance of climate and endogenous, density-dependent factors has not been clearly documented. We analyzed the population dynamics of the moth using long-term data from two provinces in the Southern Alps (Trento 19902009, Bolzano/Bozen 19752011) to evaluate the relative importance of climate and density-dependent factors as regional drivers. Both summer temperatures and rainfall significantly affected population growth rate, with different outcomes depending on the local conditions. Although previous studies indicated that low winter temperatures have negative effects on insect performance, our analyses did not show any negative effect on the population dynamics. A negative density dependent feedback with a 1-year lag emerged as the most important factor driving the population dynamics in both regions. Potential mechanisms explaining the observed negative density feedback include deterioration of host quality, increased mortality caused by pathogens, and increase of prolonged diapause as an adaptive mechanism to escape adverse conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of Pest Vulnerability of Benning Soybean Value Added and Insect Resistant Near Isogenic Lines
AB  - Crop enhancement with value added traits may affect vulnerability to insects, and evaluating the susceptibility levels of the various value added traits in elite germplasm would aid in developing integrated pest management strategies. During 20072008, five Benning soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) lines with different value added nutritional traits and four insect resistant quantitative trait loci (QTL) lines were evaluated in an effort to determine their pest vulnerability under artificial and natural insect pest populations. The lines showed variable susceptibility to lepidopterous insect pests classified as defoliators and stem feeders in replicated greenhouse and field tests. The study was carried out in Athens and Midville, GA. The green cloverworm (Hypena scabra (F.)) was the most common lepidopteran defoliator occurring in the fields. Other caterpillar pests found included the soybean looper (Pseudoplusia includens (Walker)), the bollworm (Helicoverpa zea (Boddie)), and the velvetbean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hubner)). Data indicated that there was no significantly increased pest susceptibility among the value added cultivais with improved nutritional qualities, with the insect resistant quantitative trait loci lines Benning M and Benning MGH consistently being less susceptible to lepidopterous (Noctuidae) leaf injury.

TI  - How cold was the Little Ice Age? A proxy-based reconstruction from Finland applying modern analogues of fossil midge assemblages [electronic resource]
AB  - Climate dynamics during the past ca. 700years in southern Finland were reconstructed using fossil midge (DipteraNematocera) assemblages aiming to estimate quantitatively the temperature change that has occurred from the Little Ice Age to the present. Midge stratigraphies of two sediment cores from eastern and southern Finland were chosen to be examined for temperature inferences utilizing the modern analogue technique. The new midge-based temperature inference model had a coefficient of determination of 0.901 and a prediction error of 0.498'C, showing improvement over the previous Finnish models. The combined curve of the inferred temperatures derived from both of the cores showed a decrease towards ca. 1700 AD, when temperatures were approximately 1'C cooler than the past 700years average and almost 2'C colder than present. The temperatures began to increase in southern Finland from 1800 AD and in eastern Finland from 1900 AD onwards. The highest temperatures were reached at the top of the core, representing the present climate warming. Although there was slight overestimation in the recent inferred values, the reconstructed trends were in close correspondence with the previous proxy-based, historical, and measured data that suggests that the reconstruction was realistic and reliable.

TI  - Efficacy of the auto-confusion system for mating disruption of Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) and Plodia interpunctella (Hubner)
AB  - The auto-confusion system for stored-product pyralid moths, based on the contamination of adult males with the sex female pheromone (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate (commercially known as TDA or ZETA), was evaluated. For this purpose, we applied Exosex SPTab dispensers that contained the EntostatTM powder, at a 5 5 m grid, in three facilities, one feed mill in Italy and two retail stores in Greece. In the feed mill, the most abundant pyralid species was Ephestia kuehniella. Monitoring through pheromone-baited traps in this facility indicated that the application of the Exosex SPTab dispensers decreased the number of captures 2 months after the initial application. In the case of the facilities in Greece, the most abundant species was Plodia interpunctella. In these facilities there was a continuous monitoring of moth populations from January 2008 until February 2011, with pheromone-baited traps and Petri dishes with semolina, which served as oviposition traps. In both facilities, the presence of P. interpunctella males in the pheromone-baited traps was reduced after the placement of the Exosex SPTab dispensers, in comparison to captures for the same interval from the previous years. At the same time, the number of emerging individuals in the oviposition traps was notably reduced after the Exosex SPTab dispensers placement, in comparison to the previous monitoring interval. Our study documents that the auto-confusion system is an effective and reliable technique that can be used with success against stored-product Pyralidae, to retail stores and feed mills.

TI  - Effects of adultderived carbohydrates and amino acids on the reproduction of Plutella xylostella [electronic resource]
AB  - The use of floral resources to improve the efficiency of natural enemies has grown in recent years, although their effect on pest populations has been overlooked. To understand how access to food resources by adults of Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera Plutellidae) affects their reproduction, the effects of amino acids and carbohydrates (i.e. fructose, glucose and sucrose) on the longevity, lifetime fecundity, egg viability and population growth of this important pest of brassicas are evaluated. Carbohydrate intake increases longevity, oviposition period and lifetime fecundity of P. xylostella. Oviposition period and fecundity are sixfold higher in females that consumed carbohydrates. By contrast, amino acid intake by adults does not affect reproductive parameters, even when mixed with carbohydrates. The estimated demographic parameters indicate that the adult diet is important for pest population growth because the net reproductive rate and the intrinsic rate of increase are higher when females have access to carbohydrates. These results are important from both physiological and ecological points of view. The increasing use of flowering plants as a microhabitat and food source for natural enemies may also result in benefits for herbivorous insects, compromising any success in pest control.

TI  - Influence of rubber trees on leaf-miner damage to coffee plants in an agroforestry system [electronic resource]
AB  - The coffee leaf-miner (CLM) (Leucoptera coffeella Gurin-Mneville; Lepidoptera Lyonetiidae), the main pest of coffee plants, occurs widely throughout the Neotropics where it has a significant, negative economic and quantitative impact on coffee production. This study was conducted in a rubber tree/coffee plant interface that was influenced by the trees to a varying degrees depending on the location of the coffee plants, i.e. from beneath the rubber trees, extending through a range of distances from the edge of the tree plantation to end in a coffee monocrop field. The most severe damage inflicted on coffee plants by the CLM (number of mined leaves) from April, which marks the start of the water deficit period, until September 2003 was in the zone close to the rubber trees, whereas the damage inflicted on plants in the monocropped field was comparable to that on coffee plants grown directly beneath the rubber trees, which received about 2540 % of the available irradiance (Iavailable irradiation at a certain position divided by the irradiation received in full sunlight, i.e. in the monocrop). From May until July damage caused by the CLM nearly doubled in each month. In midwinter (July), the damage decreased perceptibly from the tree edge toward the open field. From September onward, with the rising air temperatures CLM damage in the coffee monocrop started to increase. Based on these results, we conclude that coffee plants grown in the full sun incurred the most damage only at the end of winter, with warming air temperatures. Coffee plants grown in shadier locations (2540 % I) were less damaged by the CLM, although a higher proportion of their leaves were mined. The rubber trees probably acted as a shelter during the cold autumn and winter seasons, leading to greater CLM damage over a distance outside the rubber tree plantation that was about equal to the height of the trees. Future studies should attempt to relate leaf hydric potential to pest attack in field conditions. More rigorous measurements of shade conditions could improve our understanding of the relationship of this factor to CLM attack.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in the control failure likelihood of the tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta [electronic resource]
AB  - Insecticide resistance is frequently associated with field control failure, but such an assessment of its likelihood seldom occurs. This phenomenon is a potential cause of the control failure of the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae); therefore we surveyed insecticide resistance as the control failure likelihood for a duration of 7years in 20 field populations of this species. The insecticide label rate was used as the discriminating concentration, and the minimum efficacy threshold required for insecticides in Brazil (i.e. 80% efficacy) was the targeted efficacy. The spatial and temporal variations of the control failure likelihood were also assessed, as was the potential influence of land topography for the areawide pattern observed. Most populations of T. absoluta were susceptible to abamectin, chlorfenapyr and spinosad and not to bifenthrin, triflumuron and teflubenzuron. The indoxacarb susceptibility varied in space and time. Spatial dependence was observed for abamectin and indoxacarb. The control failure likelihood of T. absoluta was higher for bifenthrin, triflumuron and teflubenzuron. A flat topography and the wind direction may favour the spread of the control failure likelihood and should be considered in designing pest management programs for T. absoluta.

TI  - Acute toxicity and sublethal effects of methoxyfenozide and thiodicarb on survival, development and reproduction of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - The cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) is one of the most destructive pest insects in Iran and many other countries. In this study, lethal and sublethal effects of methoxyfenozide, and thiodicarb were evaluated against H. armigera larvae that fed on insecticide-treated artificial diet. The effects of methoxyfenozide and thiodicarb were assessed in 3rd instars. Methoxyfenozide and thiodicarb showed LC50 values of 4 and 639 mg a.i./ml, respectively, in H. armigera larvae. Sublethal effects on development, adult longevity, and reproduction were observed in H. armigera larvae that survived exposure to an LC30 of the insecticides. Larvae that were exposed to an LC30 concentration of methoxyfenozide exhibited lower pupal weight and increased larval and pupal developmental times compared with thiodicarb treated larvae or control larvae. Adults that were exposed as larvae to an LC30 concentration of methoxyfenozide or thiodicarb showed reduced fecundity (35% and 30%, respectively) compared to control adults. The tested insecticides significantly reduced adult longevity. The longevity of adult females that as larvae were treated with an LC30 concentration of methoxyfenozide or thiodicarb was reduced by 28% and 23%, respectively, in comparison to control females. We predict that the combination of lethal and sublethal effects of the insecticides, especially methoxyfenozide, will induce significant effects on field population dynamics of H. armigera.

TI  - Sperm Storage and Sperm Competition in the Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - The mechanism of reproductive behavior and sperm competition strategy in Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) has been an interesting topic for quite some time. In the current study, sperm motility pattern and sperm competition in H. armigera were investigated. The majority of apyrene and eupyrene sperm from spermatophore were simultaneously transferred to spermatheca 2 h after copulation. During 324 h after copulation, the amounts of apyrene and eupyrene sperm both sharply decreased and only approximately one seventh of one ejaculate remained stable. We used highly variable microsatellite loci to survey 13 families with a total of 379 offspring (mean 29.2 per family). In 8 of 13 families, all offspring were assigned to the last male, and 85.9% of offspring were sired by the last male in total. The possible mechanism of sperm competition in H. armigera encompassed the combined effects of both relatively fixed volume of sperm storage by females and the displacement of sperm from the formerly mated males. This study provides insight into the mechanism underlying sperm precedence in H. armigera, and it is important for potential control of the cotton bollworm.

TI  - Invading and resident defoliators in a changing climate cold tolerance and predictions concerning extreme winter cold as a rangelimiting factor [electronic resource]
AB  - 1. Winter temperatures in northern latitudes are predicted to increase markedly as a result of ongoing climate change, thus making the invasion of new insect defoliators possible. The establishment of new outbreak pest species may have major effects on northern ecosystems that are particularly sensitive to disturbances. 2. Effects of winter minimum temperatures under field and laboratory conditions were examined and limitations by minimum temperatures on future range expansion were investigated for invasive [Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera Geometridae)] and potentially invasive [Agriopis aurantiaria (Lepidoptera Geometridae)] birchfeeding forest pests. The results for the studied invasive and potentially invasive moths were compared with the parameters of the resident moth species Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera Geometridae). 3. The results showed tolerated critical temperatures of the invader (O. brumata) and the resident (E. autumnata) were more similar (differing only by 1 'C), whereas the potential invader (A. aurantiaria) was much less tolerant of cold temperatures. Although describing different stages of overwintering, results were consistent between laboratory and field studies except for those at one field location, at which other abiotic conditions are suggested to have significant influence on moth egg survival. 4. Based on the present results and expected changes in winter temperatures over the next 30 years, the range expansion of an established invasive species may be predicted. No limitations were found regarding the possible future invasion of a new pest species to northern Fennoscandia. The importance of studying a species' whole overwintering period is highlighted and further studies devoted to the effects of other abiotic factors in addition to the effects of temperature are suggested.

TI  - Field testing DesireA' Delta trap and GLS sex pheromone lure system for measuring outbreak and basal populations of Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera Nolidae)
AB  - In December 2009 and January 2010 an outbreak of Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera Nolidae), the gumleaf skeletonizer (GLS) that affects jarrah, Eucalyptus marginata, became apparent in south-western Western Australia in the vicinity of Yanmah (34A'9'S, 116A'1'E), Carter (34A'05'S, 116A'02'E) and Quinninup (34A'23'S, 116A'17'E) forest blocks. By the end of January 2011 the outbreak severely affected more than 250 000 ha of jarrah forest. This study is a preliminary field trial of the DesireA' GLS pheromone lure and trap system that compares trap results with larval populations determined from branch-clip samples. Thirteen of 19 sites for deployment of the trap and lure system were selected from an array of 61 sites from which GLS larval density data from November 2010 had been collected, and trap sites included six FORESTCHECK sites, for which long-term monitoring of forest condition had been undertaken. These 19 sites were across a rainfall gradient, and provided a strong contrast in outbreak severity between eastern and western sites. The GLS lure was highly specific for GLS, with a mean capture rate of 55 male moths per site. However, a trap at a site with a thick tall understorey that had supported a large larval population captured only four moths. The trap and GLS lure system are effective for monitoring both outbreak and basal populations of GLS in jarrah forest with an open understory. Moth captures from lure traps are an effective alternative to monitoring GLS larval populations, with the reservation that the trap system has impaired effectiveness in locations with thick understory that exceeds the trap height.

TI  - Lack of anisotropic effects in the spatial distribution of Cydia pomonella pheromone trap catches in Catalonia, NE Spain [electronic resource]
AB  - The codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), is the key pest of pome fruits in many parts of Europe and its adult flights are routinely monitored by means of sex pheromone traps checked every week during the season. We analyzed the current pheromone trap spatial configuration of codling moth located in a study area of 160,000ha in Catalonia during the period 20042006, optimized under the hypothesis of isotropy of insect catches after a preliminary study. The objectives were to test for spatial isotropy of male catches and to determine whether the spatial trap configuration was optimal in terms of the number of traps required to monitor the pest flight and the spatial process under analysis. To this end, we studied the possible presence of directional components (i.e. anisotropic effects) in the spatial distribution of male catches for the present trap configuration. The predominant wind direction was specifically tested as this may affect the flight of adult males. We developed a simple Monte Carlo approach to test anisotropic effects comparing distinct directional variograms with the trap catches of the three years. Our results suggest that insect spatial patterns were in general isotropic and that the predominant wind direction did not consistently affect the spatial distribution of insect trap catches; only 7 of 58 weeks had anisotropic effects. Since these anisotropic effects were likely residual, we conclude that the current trap spatial structure is optimal in terms of the number of traps used under the hypothesis of isotropy of insect catches.

TI  - Tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta Meyrick (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) current status in Montenegro [electronic resource]
AB  - Tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta was detected for the first time in Montenegro using pheromone traps in the middle of July 2010, in greenhouses in one location at the Montenegrin sea coast. In the period from the end of July to the first week of August, moths were captured in pheromone traps from other locations along the sea coast and surroundings of the city of Podgorica. According to the survey carried out by the authors from July to September 2010, T. absoluta was present in greenhouses in all tomatoproducing areas, while outdoors it was found only in the coastal area. Monitoring of T. absoluta continued in 2011. Pheromone traps were set up in five locations in the main tomatoproducing areas, both in greenhouses and outdoors, between 4 and 15 May. The first captured moths were detected after 715 days in all inspected locations, and captures continued until the end of September. According to the number of captured moths and the damage observed, it can be concluded that the population level in 2011 was lower in comparison with 2010, when up to 100% losses were detected in tomato crops in several locations. In 2011, tomato producers were already being informed about the pest and means of control, so most of them applied cultural and chemical control measures.

AB  - 1.Monitoring of the ecosystem of Lake Mvatn, Iceland, since 1975 has revealed extreme fluctuations in important food web components, such as chironomids and cladocerans, with amplitudes of several orders of magnitude and a period of 58years. This study uses sediment cores from the lake to examine if the food web fluctuations appear in the microfossil record of the sediment. 2.Dating was achieved by means of a combination of 137Cs and volcanic tephra and was finetuned by wigglematching of chironomid microfossil and monitoring data. 3.Cladocera exuviae and chironomid egg capsules in the uppermost 34cm of sediment were compared with the monitoring record that consisted of 30years of window trap catches of flying chironomids and a 16year record of chydorid Cladocera caught in activity traps. 4.The observed chironomid and cladoceran population fluctuations were reflected in the sediment record of chironomid eggs and of the exuviae of three of seven cladocerans Alonella nana, Alona rectangula and Eurycercus lamellatus, which also had the most extreme fluctuations in the monitoring data (34 orders of magnitude). Chydorus sphaericus, and to some extent Alona quadrangularis and Acroperus harpae, showed regular fluctuations in the core that the monitoring did not reveal. Density of subfossil chironomid eggs correlated positively with that of larval head capsules but not with other microfossils. 5.This study shows a reasonably good correspondence between the fossil records of chironomids and cladocerans on the one hand and biomonitoring data on the other. The results pave the way for an extension of the food web history to much earlier time intervals of the ecosystem, allowing the study of longterm variation in the food web dynamics, including the impact of climatic variation and other external forcing. The results also indicate the usefulness of chironomid egg capsules in palaeolimnological studies.

TI  - Modeling the interaction of physiological time, seasonal weather patterns, and delayed mating on population dynamics of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - The effect of delaying female mating on population growth in codling moth (Cydia pomonella (L.)) was found to act on a physiological time (degree-day) basis and was predictable using a simple quadratic equation. When combined with previous work on degree-day based mortality, we were able to evaluate how the magnitude of population reduction and survival varied between sites, years, and generations at locations in California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington states. In general, reductions in population growth associated with females mating 13days after emergence were greater in warmer areas and during warmer times of the year. In any given year and location, the temperature profiles during peak flight were crucial in determining the population reductions, but over an 11-year period, the average seasonal temperature profile was more important. During the overwintering generation, conditions were relatively mild in all locations and only minor differences were observed in population growth rates between locations. Populations experiencing 13days delay in female mating were reduced 8, 19 and 32% compared to populations experiencing no delay, respectively. During the first summer generation, population reductions doubled compared to those seen in the overwintering generation. During the second summer flight, reductions in population growth rate at the three cooler locations decreased, while they increased in the warmer California location. Overall, the results show delayed mating can help understand how population growth is related to environmental conditions experienced naturally by insect populations and will help guide studies of the mechanisms of mating disruption, a technique used for pest suppression in agricultural and forest systems.

TI  - Midge-inferred temperature reconstructions and vegetation change over the last ~15,000years from Trout Lake, northern Yukon Territory, eastern Beringia [electronic resource]
AB  - Two cores from Trout Lake, northern Yukon, yielded quantitative estimates of summer air temperatures using fossil midge larvae. Warming began around 14,400calyr BP, with inferred mean July air temperatures reaching values warmer than present by 12,800calyr BP. A 1'C cooling from 12,200 to 11,200calyr BP closely corresponds with the Younger Dryas chronozone. A broad temperature maximum occurred between 10,800 and 9,800calyr BP, with mean July air temperature about 2.2'C warmer than present. This represents an early Holocene thermal maximum and coincides with increased organic content of the sediment. Both the shallow- and deep-water cores show similar temperature trends for their overlapping periods. The inferred rise in mean July air temperature at 14,200calyr BP coincides with a shift in vegetation from an herb- to shrub-dominated landscape. In contrast, the increase in Alnus pollen at 6,400calyr BP does not coincide with a change in temperature, but may be a response to a rise in precipitation.

TI  - Asymmetric boundary shifts of tropical montane Lepidoptera over four decades of climate warming [electronic resource]
AB  - Aim To estimate whether species have shifted at equal rates at their leading edges (cool boundaries) and trailing edges (warm boundaries) in response to climate change. We provide the first such evidence for tropical insects, here examining elevation shifts for the upper and lower boundaries shifts of montane moths. Threats to species on tropical mountains are considered. Location Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. Methods We surveyed Lepidoptera (Geometridae) on Mount Kinabalu in 2007, 42 years after the previous surveys in 1965. Changes in species upper and lower boundaries, elevational extents and range areas were assessed. We randomly subsampled the data to ensure comparable datasets between years. Estimated shifts were compared for endemic versus more widespread species, and for species that reached their range limits at different elevations. Results Species that reached their upper limits at 2500-2700m (n= 28 species, 20% of those considered) retreated at both their lower and upper boundaries, and hence showed substantial average range contractions (300m in elevational extent and 45km in estimated range area). These declines may be associated with changes in cloud cover and the presence of ecological barriers (geological and vegetation transitions) which impede uphill movement. Other than this group, most species (n= 109, 80% of the species considered) expanded their upper boundaries upwards (by an average of 152m) more than they retreated at their lower boundaries (77m). Main conclusions Without constraints, leading margins shifted uphill faster than trailing margins retreated, such that many species increased their elevational extents. However, this did not result in increases in range area because the area of land available declines with increasing elevation. Species close to a major ecological/geological transition zone on the mountain flank declined in their range areas. Extinction risk may increase long before species reach the summit, even when undisturbed habitats are available.

TI  - A host-plant specialist, Helicoverpa assulta, is more tolerant to capsaicin from Capsicum annuum than other noctuid species [electronic resource]
AB  - Plant secondary compounds not only play an important role in plant defense, but have been a driving force for host adaptation by herbivores. Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), an alkaloid found in the fruit of Capsicum spp. (Solanaceae), is responsible for the pungency of hot pepper fruits and is unique to the genus. The oriental tobacco budworm, Helicoverpa assulta (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), is a specialist herbivore feeding on solanaceous plants including Capsicum annuum, and is one of a very few insect herbivores worldwide capable of feeding on hot pepper fruits. To determine whether this is due in part to an increased physiological tolerance of capsaicin, we compared H. assulta with another specialist on Solanaceae, Heliothis subflexa, and four generalist species, Spodoptera frugiperda, Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa armigera, and Helicoverpa zea, all belonging to the family Noctuidae. When larvae were fed capsaicin-spiked artificial diet for the entire larval period, larval mortality increased in H. subflexa and H. zea but decreased in H. assulta. Larval growth decreased on the capsaicin-spiked diet in four of the species, was unaffected in H. armigera and increased in H. assulta. Food consumption and utilization experiments showed that capsaicin decreased relative consumption rate (RCR), relative growth rate (RGR) and approximate digestibility (AD) in H. zea, and increased AD and the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) in H. armigera; whereas it did not significantly change any of these nutritional indices in H. assulta. The acute toxicity of capsaicin measured by injection into early fifth instar larvae was less in H. assulta than in H. armigera and H. zea. Injection of high concentrations produced abdominal paralysis and self-cannibalism. Injection of sub-lethal doses of capsaicin resulted in reduced pupal weights in H. armigera and H. zea, but not in H. assulta. The results indicate that H. assulta is more tolerant to capsaicin than the other insects tested, suggesting that this has facilitated expansion of its host range within Solanaceae to Capsicum after introduction of the latter to the Old World about 500 years ago. The increased larval survival and growth due to chronic dietary exposure to capsaicin suggests further adaptation of H. assulta to that compound, the mechanisms of which remain to be investigated.

TI  - Risk assessment of pea moth Cydia nigricana infestation in organic green peas based on spatio-temporal distribution and phenology of the host plant [electronic resource]
AB  - 1 A method for area-wide risk assessment of pea moth infestation in commercial pea-growing areas based on spatial and temporal analyses of pea moth abundance and the phenological distribution of pea fields was investigated. 2 In a commercial pea-growing region in Saxony, Germany, all pea fields were identified, mapped and characterized, recording the pea plant phenology, pea moth flight and larval infestation of each field in the years 2006-2008. 3 The relationship between pea moth flight and pea plant phenology was studied in detail in small-scale field experiments in Hesse, Germany, using different pea cultivars and sowing dates. 4 In the study area, the abundance of Cydia nigricana Fabricius (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in organic green peas increased linearly with the pea-cropping area of the previous year in the surroundings of the current fields according to the continuous abundance index. 5 Considering solely the early flowering period (= early pea sowing dates) of the organic green peas, we calculated that a minimum distance of the current pea field to the nearest pea field of the previous year of 500 m was necessary to significantly reduce pea moth flight and larval infestation. 6 In small-scale field experiments, a correlation between pea moth flight and larval investation, as well as the importance of the pea flower for the pea moth occurrence, was demonstrated. 7 The spatio-temporal findings are discussed in relation to the development of a coincidence avoidance strategy in pea-growing areas.

TI  - Origin and taxonomic status of the Palearctic population of the stem borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefbvre) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) [electronic resource]
AB  - The major pest of maize in Mediterranean Europe, the stem borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefbvre) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), has a fragmented distribution, north and south of the Sahara. The present study aimed (1) to clarify the uncertain taxonomic status of the Palearctic and sub-Saharan populations which were first considered as different species and later on as subspecies (Sesamia nonagrioides nonagrioides and Sesamia nonagrioides botanephaga) and (2) to investigate the origin of the Palearctic population which extends from Spain to Iran, outside what is considered typical for this mainly tropical genus. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of both populations using one nuclear and two mitochondrial genes. The sub-Saharan taxon was fragmented in two isolated populations (West and East) whose mitochondrial genes were distant by 2.3%. The Palearctic population was included in the East African clade and its genes were close or identical to those of a population from Central Ethiopia, where the species was discovered for the first time. Similarly, in Africa, the alleles of the nuclear gene were distributed mainly in two West and East clades, whereas some Palearctic alleles belonged to the West clade. The Palearctic population originated therefore from East and West Africa and is the progeny of the cross between these two African populations. The main species concepts were in agreement, leading to the conclusion that the three populations are still conspecific. In the surveyed regions, the species therefore does not include two subspecies but three isolated populations. The Palearctic population suffered from severe bottlenecks that resulted in the fixation of one East African mitochondrial genome and the large reduction in its genetic diversity compared to the African populations. The data suggest that natural colonization of the Palearctic region was more plausible than human introduction. The allelic distribution of the Palearctic population was similar to that of species that survived the last glaciation. It is concluded that the African populations expanded during the last interglacial, crossed the Sahara and mixed in North Africa where fixation of the East mitochondrial genome occurred. The species then colonized Europe westward through only one eastern entrance. The coalescent-based estimate of the time to the ancestor of the Palearctic population was 108 000 years, which is consistent with this scenario. 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 103, 904-922.

TI  - Spotted cutworm, Xestia c-nigrum (L.) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) responses to sex pheromone and blacklight [electronic resource]
AB  - Traps baited with the sex pheromone blend of (Z7)- and (Z5)-tetradecenyl acetate captured significant numbers of male spotted cutworm moths, Xestia c-nigrum (L.) compared to unbaited traps. Nearly no males were captured in traps baited with (Z7)-tetradecenyl acetate, the major pheromone component. Antennae of spotted cutworm males responded to (Z7)-, (E7)-, (Z5)- and (E5)-tetradecenyl acetate in the laboratory; however there was no response by moths in the field to the E isomers when presented in traps as major and minor components respectively of a binary blend or to the (E7) isomer as a single component. These findings clarify the makeup of a sex attractant that can be used for monitoring X. c-nigrum on agricultural crops in Washington. However, multi-year season-long monitoring of spotted cutworm moths in Yakima Valley apple orchards revealed differential responses to pheromone and blacklight traps. A spring flight period showed a strong moth response to the pheromone compared to blacklight, while a later summer flight period showed a weak moth response to the pheromone relative to blacklight. At this time, we do not know which trap type might best indicate spotted cutworm abundance and risk to crops.

TI  - Synchronous phenology of hawkmoths (Sphingidae) and Inga species (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) implications for the restoration of the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil [electronic resource]
AB  - Biotic and abiotic factors such as resource availability and rainfall may exert influence on the life cycle of several organisms. In this study, we investigated correlations between the phenology of hawkmoths, flowering phenology of Inga Mill. species (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae-Ingeae) and rainfall in one of the largest remnants of Atlantic forest in northeastern Brazil (Coimbra forest with ca. 3500 ha). We carried out monthly hawkmoth inventories and phenological observations of the five most abundant Inga species in Coimbra forest from October 2005 to August 2007. Altogether 39 hawkmoth individuals were collected with light trap or butterfly net, which were ascribed to nine genera and 14 species. With the present study Pachygonidia caliginosa Boisduval (Bombycoidea-Sphingidae-Dilophonotina) is registered for the second time in Brazil, since the species had been previously collected only in the Amazon. The tribe Dilophonotina was the most represented with five species. Animals with short proboscises (14.7-35.0 mm) represented over 69.7% of the sample. Most individuals were collected during the months of low rainfall, the same period of the highest flower abundance of five Inga species. The flowering of Inga vera, I. striata and I. ingoides was positively correlated with hawkmoth abundance. The synchrony of the activity period of these animals in adult phase with certain nectar sources, and the relationship between morphological parameters of hawkmoths and Inga flowers suggest a narrow pollination mutualistic relationship at the study site. Considering the hotspot status of the Atlantic forest due to high fragmentation and habitat loss, as well as the previous local extinction of hawkmoth species in smaller fragments of the studied landscape, our results are relevant for restoration plans not only for the Brazilian Atlantic forest, but for neotropical forests in general, where Inga is native.

TI  - Phylogenetic island disequilibrium evidence for ongoing long-term population dynamics in two Mediterranean butterflies [electronic resource]
AB  - Aim Our aims were to verify the existence of phylogenetic disequilibrium between butterfly lineages at the subcontinental scale for islands and the nearest mainland and to test the capacity of islands for hosting ancestral populations of butterflies and the significance of such relict populations. Location The western Mediterranean continental area of Europe and North Africa together with several large and small islands (Balearics, Tuscan Archipelago, Aeolian Archipelago, Capri, Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica). Methods Using geometric morphometrics, the shape of male genitalia was analysed in two common butterflies (Pyronia cecilia and Pyronia tithonus), whose spatial heterogeneity in the Mediterranean region has recently been described. Observed patterns in genital shapes were compared with shapes predicted for islands and fossil islands to assess the contribution of historical and current events in accounting for the transition from a refugial model to an equilibrium model. Measurements were taken for 473 specimens in 90 insular and mainland sites. Results The shape of the genitalia of populations of most islands differed substantially from that predicted by the equilibrium hypothesis while closely fitting the refugial hypothesis. The comparison between different models strongly suggests that islands maintain ancestral lineages similar to those living in Spain (P. cecilia) and France (P. tithonus). A high correlation between observed and predicted patterns on islands and fossil islands occurs during the first steps of modelled introgressive hybridization while the following steps exposed a successively lower fit, suggesting that the process from a refugial to an equilibrium situation is highly skewed towards an earlier non-equilibrium. Main conclusions The observed non-equilibrium pattern supports the refugial hypothesis, suggesting that an ancestral lineage was originally distributed from Spain to Italy, and also occupied offshore islands. This lineage, replaced in Italy, has persisted on the islands owing to their isolation. A comparison of the distribution patterns for genetic and morphometric markers in several species indicates that the situation highlighted for Pyronia may represent a common biogeographic feature for many Mediterranean butterflies.

TI  - Stem injection of a systemic insecticide to control Uraba lugens on urban Lophostemon confertus trees [electronic resource]
AB  - BACKGROUND Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera Nolidae) has the potential to become a serious pest of susceptible forestry and urban trees in New Zealand. Stem injection of insecticides provides a method for the control of U. lugens in public locations where foliar applications are not suitable. Field and laboratory studies were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to determine a dose response profile of U. lugens larvae to acephate injected at 0.0, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 g cm1 tree diameter measured at breast height (dbh). The concentration of the injected solution varied across years. RESULTS The highest mortality (85100%) of U. lugens larvae occurred at 1.00 g acephate injected cm1 dbh. The lower rates (0.25 and 0.50 g acephate cm1) were more effective in 2010 than in 2009, a factor attributed to the change in volume of injected solution. CONCLUSION Systemic injections of acephate at rates above 0.50 g cm1 dbh provide a tool for the management of U. lugens in public places. It is recommended that stem injection operations for control of U. lugens larvae be timed to coincide with the emergence of first instars so that larvae are exposed to lethal insecticide doses.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Interactions Between Maize Lepidopteran Stemborer Communities and Possible Implications From the Recent Invasion of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Sub-Saharan Africa
AB  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of multi-species pest communities and the interactions between them influence the structure of pest complex that attack crops. In East and Southern Africa, cereal crops, especially maize, is attacked by a complex of lepidopteran stemborer species made up of Busseola fusca (Fuller) and Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). There is inadequate information on the extent of single-and multi-species infestations by this pest complex, their current spatio-temporal variations, and the primary abiotic factors that influence these. Furthermore, the recent invasion of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda J.E. Smith, in sub-Saharan Africa will likely influence this stemborer community structure. Sampling was conducted in maize fields to record stemborer species and larval numbers from infested plants, in 28 localities found in six agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Kenya and parts of Tanzania, as well as in one locality in the mid-altitudes where the three stemborer species occurred together. Both single- and multi-species stemborer communities characterized infestation of maize at field and plant levels, but varied in proportions between the AEZs. Infestation patterns and larval densities varied between seasons at mid-locality stemborer communities followed a clustered distribution pattern. Temperature was the most significant abiotic factor influencing the composition of stemborer communities at all spatial scales. Rainfall was significant only at the local scale. Results are discussed in relation to current stemborer community structures in maize fields and what the likely potential implications are, in the light of climate change and the recent establishment of the fall armyworm in Africa.

However, recent research has uncovered many examples of closely related herbivores using the same host plant(s), suggesting that partitioning of host plants is not the only mechanism generating diversity. Herbivores sharing hosts may utilize different parts of the same plant, but such resource partitioning is often not apparent; hence, the factors that allow closely related herbivores to coexist are still largely undetermined. We examined whether partitioning of phenology or natural enemies may explain the coexistence of leaf cone moths (Caloptilia; Gracillariidae) associated with maples (Acer; Sapindaceae). Larval activity of 10 sympatric Caloptilia species found on nine maple species was monitored every 2-3 weeks for a total of 13 sampling events, and an exhaustive search for internal parasitoid wasps was conducted using high-throughput sequencing. Blocking primers were used to facilitate the detection of wasp larvae inside moth tissue. We found considerable phenological overlap among Caloptilia species, with two clear peaks in July and September-October. Coexisting Caloptilia species also had largely overlapping parasitoid communities; a total of 13 chalcid and ichneumon wasp species attacked Caloptilia in a nonspecific fashion at an overall parasitism rate of 46.4%. Although coexistence may be facilitated by factors not accounted for in this study, it appears that niche partitioning is not necessary for closely related herbivores to stably coexist on shared hosts. Co-occurrence without resource partitioning may provide an additional axis along which herbivorous insects attain increased species richness.

TI  - Maximizing Information Yield From Pheromone-Baited Monitoring Traps: Estimating Plume Reach, Trapping Radius, and Absolute Density of Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Michigan Apple
AB  - Novel methods of data analysis were used to interpret codling moth (Cydia pomonella) catch data from central-trap, multiple-release experiments using a standard codlemone-baited monitoring trap in commercial apple orchards not under mating disruption. The main objectives were to determine consistency and reliability for measures of: 1) the trapping radius, composed of the trap's behaviorally effective plume reach and the maximum dispersive distance of a responder population; and 2) the proportion of the population present in the trapping area that is caught. Two moth release designs were used: 1) moth releases at regular intervals in the four cardinal directions, and 2) evenly distributed moth releases across entire approximately 18-ha orchard blocks using both high and low codling moth populations. For both release designs, at high populations, the mean proportion catch was 0.01, and for the even release of low populations, that value was approximately 0.02. Mean maximum dispersive distance for released codling moth males was approximately 260 m. Behaviorally effective plume reach for the standard codling moth trap was < 5 m, and total trapping area for a single trap was approximately 21 ha. These estimates were consistent across three growing seasons and are supported by extraordinarily high replication for this type of field experiment. Knowing the trapping area and mean proportion caught, catch number per single monitoring trap can be translated into absolute pest density using the equation: males per trapping area = catch per trapping area/proportion caught. Thus, catches of 1, 3, 10, and 30 codling moth males per trap translate to approximately 5, 14, 48, and 143 males/ha, respectively, and reflect equal densities of females, because the codling moth sex ratio is 1:1. Combined with life-table data on codling moth fecundity and mortality, along with data on crop yield per trapping area, this fundamental knowledge of how to interpret catch numbers will enable pest managers to make considerably more precise projections of damage and therefore more precise and reliable decisions on whether insecticide applications are justified. The principles and methods established here for estimating absolute codling moth density may be broadly applicable to pests generally and thereby could set a new standard for integrated pest management decisions based on trapping.

TI  - Ovarian development and synthetic sex pheromone lure trapping of adults of the rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Lepidoptera Pyralidae)
AB  - [Aim] The physiological status of migratory insects is complex, and this influences the stability and accuracy of synthetic sex pheromone lure trapping. This study aims to study the efficacy of sex pheromone lure trapping on monitoring the population dynamics of the rice leaf roller, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis during different migration periods, and the relationship between sex pheromone lure trapping and ovarian development of female adults of this moth. [Methods] Synthetic sex pheromone lures and sweeping net were used to monitor the population dynamics of C. medinalis in four localities, i. e., Ningbo city and Wenzhou city of Zhejiang province, Binyang county of Guangxi autonomous region and Ningdu county of Jiangxi province, from September 2015. The female ovaries were dissected and the features of female ovaries for gradation were photographed. Bivariate correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between sex pheromone lure trapping and ovarian development of female adults. [Results] From late June to mid July, the rice leaf roller in Binyang county was the mixed population of the emigrant and local breeding generations. Various stages of ovaries were found in Binyang county but the proportions of stages I and II ovaries were higher than those of other stages. In early July, the rice leaf roller in Ningdu county was the immigrant generation, and most ovaries (>70%) were in stage IV and the proportion of mated adults was 91. 3%. Adults were moving out from Beilun district of Ningbo city in late September, and the number of adults reduced gradually till they all disappeared. The ovaries of female adults in Beilun were immature and no mating was found. The adults collected in Ouhai district of Wenzhou city in early October might be the transit generation from Ningbo city, and the number of adults reduced gradually till they all disappeared, too. Stages II and III were the main ovarian stages of C. medinalis in this region. Mating was found in some female adults in Wenzhou, but oviposition was not found. For the immigrant generation, the transit generation and the local breeding generation, the population dynamics monitored with sex pheromone lure trapping was similar to that monitored with sweeping net. Sex pheromone lure did not trap emigrant male adults, because they were sexually immature. However, emigrant adults could be collected by sweeping net. Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the number of male adults trapped by sex pheromone lure and the number of adults collected by sweeping net (P <0. 05), and there was also an extremely significant correlation between the number of male adults trapped by sex pheromone lure and the number of sexually mature female adults (P < 0. 001). [Conclusion] Sex pheromone lure can be used for accurate monitoring of the population dynamics of C. medinalis. Due to the extremely significant correlation between the population dynamics monitored with sex pheromone lure and the ovarian developmental stages of female adults, sex pheromone lure trapping might be better than the disturbing and counting method for predicting the population levels and control time of C. medinalis.

TI  - OCCUPANCY OF THE TERRITORY BY LYMANTRIA DISPAR (L.) (LEPIDOPTERA EREBIDAE) EGG MASSES AS A PREDICTIVE INDEX OF DAMAGE
AB  - In Sardinia (Italy) the population abundance of the defoliator gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera Erebidae) has been regularly sampled for over thirty years by counts of egg masses. This monitoring activity allows annual identification of the areas with the highest abundance of infestation in order to define the areas to be subjected to phytosanitary treatments and thus to confine the damage caused by gypsy moth defoliation. However, the identification of areas to be treated have been defined exclusively according to the experience gained over the years by the operators. To overcome the limitation of this empirical approach we have developed an objective method supporting decision making based on the relationship between the percentage of infested sites and the intensity of defoliation. For this purpose the radius of annual gypsy moth expansion was estimated in a cork oak district: the estimated value was ca. 6 km per year. This value was used to calculate the percentage of sites occupied by at least 1 egg mass within that radius. A generalized linear model was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the relationship between percentage of occupied sites and presence of damage. According to what we know from literature a monitoring site was considered damaged when defoliation level of foliage was greater than 50%. We then used the historical series of data to calculate the probability that a defoliation event would occur according to the estimated model. The logit model confirmed the validity of the predictor with respect to the presence of damage, with a general accuracy greater than 90%. The results suggest a revision of the sampling protocol used thus far, which requires a particularly costly and prolonged sampling effort. The method described herein should allow easier identification of forest areas exposed to damage and timelier planning of control interventions.

TI  - Characterization of Ostrinia furnacalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) Occurrence Against Maize and Sorghum Varieties in a Paddy-upland Rotation Field
AB  - Occurrence of oriental corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, and yield in a paddy-upland rotation field for 8 maize (Eolrukchal 1, Heugjeom 2, Miheukchal, Ilmichal, Heukjinjuchal, Chalok 4, Mibaek 2, Daehakchal) and 7 sorghum (Hwanggeumchal, Anzunbaengisusu, Moktaksusu, Sodamchal, DS-202, Nampungchal, Donganme) varieties has been surveyed. In a monitoring study using a pheromone trap carried out from 15 May to 10 September, the density of O. furnacalis adults increased rapidly from about 2 weeks after maize planting and reached the highest density at mid June. After that, their density was fluctuated a little at earlier September. The number of the damaged maize and invasive pores on the stem of 2 maizes and sorghum varieties was examined. The mean number of the damaged maize per 20 plants was 19 and 18 plants, and the number of invasive pores was 1.8 and 1.4 per maize stem in Daehakchal and Mibaek 2, respectively. In a survey carried out at harvest period using 8 maize varieties, the damaged ratio was 94%, 92%, 71%, 64%, 54%, 52%, and 45% in Daehakchal, Mibaek 2, Ilmichal, Eolrukchal 1, Chalok 4, Miheukchal, and Heugjeom 2, respectively. The number of invasive pore per Ilmichal stem was 1.4 and that of the others was less than 1.0 per stem. In addition, the damaged ratio of maize ears was 50% in Ilmichal, 40% in Heukjinjuchal, 37% in Daehakchal, etc. The damage pattern of 2 sorghum varieties, Nampungchal and Donganme, by O. furnacalis larvae was steeply increased from planting to 2 months and the trend was continued up to earlier August. At this time, the mean number of damaged sorghum was 13 and 9.2 plants for Nampungchal and Donganme, and the number of invasive stem pores was 1.06 and 0.46, respectively. In another survey carried out at harvest period for 7 sorghum varieties, their damaged ratio was 95% in DS-202, 76% in Moktaksusu, 75% in Sodamchal, 67% in Nampungchal, 57% in Anzunbaengisusu, 46% in Donganme, and 34% in Hwanggeumchal. The damage of sorghum varieties was much higher and severer than that of maizes by O. furnacalis larvae. The number of invasive pores on a sorghum stem was 1.7 in DS-202, 1.4 in Moktaksusu, 1.3 in Sodamchal, 1.1 in Nampungchal, 1.0 in Anzunbaengisusu, 0.5 in Donganme, and 0.4 in Hwanggeumchal. Meanwhile, there was no distinct connection between damaging results and yields of maizes and sorghums by O. furnacalis larvae in a paddy-upland rotation field. These results from this study can be applicable for the establishment of a management strategy to control Oriental corn borer in paddy-upland rotation fields for maize and sorghum.

TI  - Chemical Composition of the Low-Polar Fraction of the Copitarsia uncilata Burgos & Leiva (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Eversible Pheromone Gland
AB  - In Colombia, Copitarsia uncilata Burgos & Leiva has been reported as a pest of ornamental flowers. The leafworm causes serious economic losses to farmers because the shipments are intercepted at the detection sites. The identification and subsequent synthesis of the sex pheromone compounds can lead to the use of semiochemicals as an important strategy to complement the pest management. This paper identifies and characterizes the chemical components of the female sexual gland of C. uncilata at three different age stages in order to relate the effect of age on the gland extract composition. Eggs and larvae were collected from commercial crops. The specimens were reared and sexed. Pheromone glands of intact females were excised at (a) 1-2, (b) 3-4, and (c) 5-6 days old. The extracts were analyzed using GC-MS after two extraction time points: 20 min and 8 days. The extracts from the third age stage showed an increase in concentration for 35% of the compounds after 8 days of storage. The relative abundance as a function of the female age showed two trends: an upward trend, where the relative abundances of the compounds increased through the age stages, while some compounds shown a downward trend. Within the first trend, mostly of the compounds were found to be related with infochemicals type structures, where tetradec-9-en-1-yl acetate (within several C-14 long-chain alcohols) is the main one. The 9-14:Ac quadrupled concentration through the ages is possibly related to the increased length of calling period as female moth age.

TI  - Seasonal Occurrence Patterns of Synanthedon tenuis and S. bicingulata (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) in Sweet Persimmon Orchards in the Southern Part of Korea
AB  - Seasonal occurrence patterns of Synanthedon tenuis and S. bicingulata (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) were monitored in sweet (non-astringent) persimmon orchards in the southern part of Korea from 2013 to 2105, using sex pheromone traps of the respective species. The two species occurred twice a year. Peak occurrences of the 1st and 2nd generations of S. tenuis were observed in late May nd mid to late September, respectively, while those of S. bicingulata were in early May to early June and mid to late September, respectively. Pooled catches of S. tenuis during the three years from the three locations showed that the 1 st generation was 1.9 times larger than the 2 nd generation. In contrast, pooled catches of S. bicingulata showed that the 2 nd generation was 1.3 fold larger than as the 1 st generation. However, it remains unclear whether S. bicingulata damages persimmon tree or not.

TI  - Species From the Heliothinae Complex (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Tucuman, Argentina, an Update of Geographical Distribution of Helicoverpa armigera
AB  - The Heliothinae complex in Argentina encompasses Helicoverpa gelotopoeon (Dyar), Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), and Chloridea virescens (Fabricius). In Tucuman, the native species H. gelotopoeon is one of the most voracious soybean pests and also affects cotton and chickpea, even more in soybean-chickpea succession cropping systems. Differentiation of the Heliothinae complex in the egg, larva, and pupa stages is difficult. Therefore, the observation of the adult wing pattern design and male genitalia is useful to differentiate species. The objective of this study was to identify the species of the Heliothinae complex, determine population fluctuations of the Heliothinae complex in soybean and chickpea crops using male moths collected in pheromone traps in Tucuman province, and update the geographical distribution of H. armigera in Argentina. The species found were H. gelotopoeon, H. armigera, H. zea, and C. virescens. Regardless of province, county, crop, and year, the predominant species was H. gelotopoeon. Considering the population dynamics of H. gelotopoeon and H. armigera in chickpea and soybean crops, H. gelotopoeon was the most abundant species in both crops, in all years sampled, and the differences registered were significant. On the other hand, according to the Sistema Nacional Argentino de Vigilancia y Monitoreo de Plagas (SINAVIMO) database and our collections, H. armigera was recorded in eight provinces and 20 counties of Argentina, and its larvae were found on soybean, chickpea, sunflower crops and spiny plumeless thistle (Carduus acanthoides). This is the first report of H. armigera in sunflower and spiny plumeless thistle in Argentina.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in a Cotton Production Area
AB  - Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) are major pests of cotton in Greece and elsewhere. Analysing male captures in pheromone traps over two seasons, in two cotton producing sites in central Greece, the spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics were examined. In 2007, captures of male H. armigera increased in late July and maintained at high levels for 1 month and declined at the end of August. For P. gossypiella, male captures remained at low levels during summer, increased late in August, peaked at mid of September and declined toward the end of the season. In 2008, trap captures of both species increased sharply by the end of June and remained at relatively high levels until August and September for P. gossypiella and H. armigera, respectively. Spatial analysis produced a spatial trend map over space, a temporal stability map over time and a spatial and temporal trend map for both species, which could lead in separating the field into management zones, and direct control to areas that exhibit high densities of the pest population and are stable over time.

TI  - Cloning and spatiotemporal and temperature-induced expression profiling of diapause bioclock protein TIME-EA4 gene in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)
AB  - [Aim] Time interval measuring enzyme (TIME-EA4) is a diapause bioclock protein in insects. This study aims to clone TIME-EA4 cDNA and analyze its spatiotemporal expression patterns in various developmental stages and different tissues of Chilo suppressalis, including the populations collected in the fields, and diapause and non-diapause populations induced at various temperatures. [Methods] Full-length cDNA sequence of TIME-EA4 gene of C. suppressalis was cloned by using RACE technique. The relative expression levels of TIME-EA4 in different developmental stages, different tissues of the 6th instar larvae, larvae of field populations collected in different seasons and the 6th instar larvae from different populations of the moth treated for one hour at different temperatures were assayed by real-time PCR. [Results] The full-length cDNA of C. suppressalis TIME-EA4 is 821 bp, with an open reading frame of 516 bp encoding 172 aa. TIME-EA4 was ubiquitously expressed, but with higher expression levels in early pupae and adults, and in the head, fat body and midgut of the 6th instar larvae. And the expression level of TIME-EA4 in the tissues of diapause larvae was much higher than that in the non-diapause larvae. Interestingly, the expression level of TIME-EA4 was significantly increased 3-fold in diapause groups compared with that in the non-diapause individuals. The abundance of TIME-EA4 gene was elevated at <= 10 degrees C in the non-diapause population, and reached the peak at 10 degrees C. However, TIME-EA4 expression was not significantly altered by temperature change in the diapause population. [Conclusion] These results suggest that the enhanced expression of TIME-EA4 correlates with the low temperature stress or low temperature-induced diapause in C. suppressalis. This study forms a basis for further investigation of TIME-EA4 in the diapause of agricultural pests.

TI  - Revealing hidden species distribution with pheromones: the case of Synanthedon vespiformis (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) in Sweden
AB  - Synanthedon vespiformis L. (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) is considered a rare insect in Sweden, discovered in 1860, with only a few observations recorded until a sex pheromone attractant became available recently. This study details a national survey conducted using pheromones as a sampling method for this species. Through pheromone trapping we captured 439 specimens in Southern Sweden at 77 sites, almost tripling the number of previously reported records for this species. The results suggest that S. vespiformis is truly a rare species with a genuinely scattered distribution, but can be locally abundant. Habitat analyses were conducted in order to test the relationship between habitat quality and the number of individuals caught. In Sweden, S. vespiformis is thought to be associated with oak hosts, but our attempts to predict its occurrence by the abundance of oaks yielded no significant relationships. We therefore suggest that sampling bias and limited knowledge on distribution may have led to the assumption that this species is primarily reliant on oaks in the northern part of its range, whereas it may in fact be polyphagous, similar to S. vespiformis found as an agricultural pest in Central and Southern Europe. We conclude that pheromones can massively enhance sampling potential for this and other rare lepidopteran species. Large-scale pheromone-based surveys provide a snapshot of true presences and absences across a considerable part of a species national distribution range, and thus for the first time provide a viable means of systematically assessing changes in distribution over time with high spatiotemporal resolution.

TI  - Estimating sampling efficiency of diurnal Lepidoptera in farmland
AB  - Setting up effective survey strategies for biodiversity monitoring in agro-ecosystems is a major task in order to detect adverse effects on biodiversity before negative changes will manifest. Here, we studied the relative costs required for the monitoring of butterflies and selected diurnal moths (Papilionoidea et Hesperioidea; Zygaenoidea: Zygaenidae) in farmland. Analysing data from a well-established Lepidoptera monitoring system in Switzerland, we assessed the influence of inspection periods, inspection frequency and transect length on counts of diurnal Lepidoptera. Furthermore, we estimated the number of transects in relation to sampling effort necessary to detect changes of a given effect size for recorded species number (and abundance). Reducing the counting frequency from seven to four inspections per season still yielded 80-90 % of the species, as long as peak abundances in summer months were included. The variation in observed species number was mostly independent of inspection frequency, but strongly increased when transect length was reduced to less than 1 km. Sedentary Lepidoptera species are especially valuable indicators as their occurrences are directly linked to local effects on biodiversity, and the proportion of recorded sedentary species was not substantially affected by reduced inspection frequency. Transects of 1-1.5 km length were generally the most cost-efficient to detect an effect on total species number of diurnal Lepidoptera in arable landscapes, given that travelling distances between transects were short. Studying effects on rare species or selected species groups would involve higher sampling intensity and costs. Surveying schemes with reduced inspection frequency and transect lengths can detect changes in species richness and total abundance of diurnal Lepidoptera cost-effectively. Facing expected changes in agricultural policy and management, the results and recommendations presented here will help to implement and improve cost-efficient Lepidoptera schemes to monitor changes in arable landscapes.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA COI characterization of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) from Paraguay and Uruguay
AB  - Since its detection in Brazil in 2013, the Old World cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera has been reported in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Here we present evidence extending the South American range of H. armigera to Uruguay, using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of the partial mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I region. Molecular characterization of this gene region from individuals from Paraguay also supports previous morphological identification of H. armigera in Paraguay. Shared mtDNA haplotypes in H. armigera from Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay were identified. Additional surveying of populations in this region will be imperative to better monitor and understand factors that are underpinning its presence and successful adaptation in these South American regions. We discuss our findings with respect to the development of resistance pest management strategies of this invasive insect pest in a predominantly monoculture soybean crop landscape in the Southern Cone region.

TI  - Assessment of Yield Loss Caused by the African White Rice Stem Borer (Maliarpha separatella Rag (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) at Mwea Irrigation Scheme, Kirinyaga County, Kenya
AB  - Information on losses caused by the African white rice stem borer, MalMrpha separatella rag, which is an important rice pest in Kenya is scanty. The development and implementation of effective pest management strategies relies on accurately defined Economic Injury Levels (EIL) for that pest. Investigations were, therefore, conducted to determine yield losses caused by /14. separatellaand economic injury level of the pest. The experiment was conducted in an insect proof screen house at Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization, Mwea station. The experiment was arranged as a (2 x 6) factorial design and each treatment replicated three times. First factor was time of infestation at two levels, early and late which was 3 and 6 weeks after transplant date, respectively. Second factor was infestation rate at six levels (0, 1, 2 4, 6 and 8 egg masses). Results indicated that infestation levels of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 114. separatella egg masses at early infestation resulted in grain yield losses of 59.8, 83.2, 84.8 90.2 and 90.9%, while losses of same infestation levels at late infestation was 34.3, 52.1, 63.4, 81.8 and 80.8%. There was a strong positive relationship between yield loss and 114. separatella population levels (y =-214.29x+ 1693.4, r(2)= 0.8416). On the basis of cost benefit ratio, the economic injury level was 6 and 8 egg masses per square meter in the early and late infestation, respectively. The action threshold for early infestation was 4 egg masses and 6 egg masses for late infestation.

TI  - Baseline Susceptibility of Helicoverpa punctigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to Indoxacarb, Emamectin Benzoate, and Chlorantraniliprole
AB  - Susceptibility in Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) to emamectin benzoate, chlorantraniliprole, and indoxacarb was established from feeding assays on insecticide-incorporated artificial diet in the laboratory. The variation in dose responses was examined in H. punctigera field populations collected in eastern Australia between September 2013 and January 2016 and compared with a laboratory strain. Chlorantraniliprole was the most toxic insecticide with an average LC50 of 3.7 g of insecticide per liter of diet (n = 12 field strains). The average LC50 for emamectin benzoate was 5.6 g of insecticide per liter of diet (n = 11 field strains), whereas indoxacarb had the lowest toxicity with an average LC50 of 172 g of insecticide per liter of diet (n = 14 field strains). Variation in susceptibility between field strains was low at 1.9-, 2.4-, and 2-fold for chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, and indoxacarb, respectively. Narrow ranges of intra-specific tolerance, high slopes, and goodness-of-fit to a probit binomial model suggested feeding bioassays using insecticide-incorporated diet were a more effective laboratory method for measuring dose responses of these insecticides in H. punctigera than traditional topical bioassays. We propose discriminating concentrations of 0.032, 0.026, and 4 g of insecticide/ml of diet for chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, and indoxacarb, respectively, to monitor insecticide resistance in H. punctigera. Although the potential for H. punctigera to develop insecticide resistance is considered low based on historical records, recent changes in population dynamics of this species in eastern Australia may have increased the risk of resistance development.

TI  - Owlet moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidea) associated with Bt and non-Bt soybean in the brazilian savanna
AB  - The use of GMO expressing Bt toxin in soybean production has increased significantly in the last years in Brazil in order to manage the damage caused by lepidopteran pests. In this study, we compared the richness and abundance of owlet moths (Noctuoidea) associated with Bt and non-Bt soybean. We determined the temporal variations as a function of phenology, and correlated the population variations of the most common species with meteorological variables. The research was conducted at the experimental area of Embrapa Cerrados. The collection method used was differentiated being suppressive and absolute. A total of 13 species were collected, of which eight occurred on Bt soybeans. The most representative taxa were Chrysodeixis includens (72.87%), Anticarsia gemmatalis (18.17%) and Spodoptera spp (5.22%). The number of larvae belonging to species targeted by the Bt technology was 10 times lower on Bt than on non-Bt soybeans. Utetheisa ornatrix and Elaphria deltoides were recorded on soybean for the first time, observing larvae of both species in non-Bt soybean and those of U. ornatrix also in Bt soybean. Only A. gemmatalis larvae correlated (p<0.05) negatively with precipitation. This tudy provided field information on the abundance and species richness of owlet moths on non-Bt soybeans, associated with the effects of Bt soybean. When considering the different levels of infestation between cultivars as a criterion, larvae monitoring is of substantial importance in order to develop the lost control program.

TI  - Early sponges and toxic protists: possible sources of cryostane, an age diagnostic biomarker antedating Sturtian Snowball Earth
AB  - The period 800-717million years (Ma) ago, in the lead-up to the Sturtian Snowball glaciation, saw an increase in the diversity of eukaryotic microfossils. To afford an independent and complementary view of this evolutionary period, this study presents the distribution of eukaryotic biomarkers from three pre-Sturtian successions across the supercontinent Rodinia: the ca. 780Ma Kanpa Formation of the Western Australian Officer Basin, the ca. 800-740Ma Visingso Group of Sweden, and the 740Ma Chuar Group in Arizona, USA. The distribution of eukaryotic steranes is remarkably similar in the three successions but distinct from all other known younger and older sterane assemblages. Cholestane was the only conventional structure, while indigenous steranes alkylated in position C-24, such as ergostane, stigmastane, dinosterane and isopropylcholestane, and n-propylcholestane, were not observed. This sterane distribution appears to be age diagnostic for the pre-Sturtian Neoproterozoic. It attests to the distinct evolutionary state of pre-Snowball eukaryotes, pointing to a taxonomic disparity that was still lower than in the Ediacaran (635-541Ma). All three basins also show the presence of a new C-28 sterane that was tentatively identified as 26-methylcholestane, here named cryostane. The only known extant organisms that can methylate sterols in the 26-position are demosponges. This assignment is plausible as molecular clocks place the appearance of the earliest animals into the pre-Sturtian Neoproterozoic. The unusual 26-methylsterol may have protected sponges, but also other eukaryotes, against their own membranolytic toxins. Some protists release lytic toxins to deter predators and kill eukaryotic prey. As conventional membrane sterols can be the site of attack for these toxins, sterols with unusual side-chain modification protect the cell. This interpretation of cryostane supports fossil evidence of predation in the Chuar Group and promotes hypotheses about the proliferation of eukaryophagy in the lead-up to the Cryogenian.

TI  - Rhigognostis senilella (Zetterstedt, 1839) and R-marmorosella (Wocke, 1849): two valid species distinguishable in genitalia (Lepidoptera, Plutellidae)
AB  - Rhigognostis senilella was described from Greenland over 150 years ago by Zetterstedt. Its historical range of distribution included also mountains in most of Europe. It was classified in Europe as a boreal-alpine zoogeographic element. Analysis of the structure of the male and female genitalia over its historical range shows that two distinct species are present. The range of R. senilella (Zetterstedt, 1839) is limited to Greenland and Iceland, whereas the mountains of Europe are inhabited by R. marmorosella (Wocke, 1849). The paper includes keys to distinguish these two species, one based on external characters, another on male or female genitalia.

TI  - Geostatistics and Geographic Information Systems to Study the Spatial Distribution of Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Peach Fields
AB  - The oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), is the most serious pest in peach, and several insecticide applications are required to reduce crop damage to acceptable levels. Geostatistics and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are employed to measure the range of spatial correlation of G. molesta in order to define the optimum sampling distance for performing spatial analysis and to determine the current distribution of the pest in peach orchards of southern Uruguay. From 2007 to 2010, 135 pheromone traps per season were installed and georeferenced in peach orchards distributed over 50,000 ha. Male adult captures were recorded weekly from September to April. Structural analysis of the captures was performed, yielding 14 semivariograms for the accumulated captures analyzed by generation and growing season. Two sets of maps were constructed to describe the pest distribution. Nine significant models were obtained in the 14 evaluated periods. The range estimated for the correlation was from 908 to 6884 m. Three hot spots of high population level and some areas with comparatively low populations were constant over the 3-year period, while there is a greater variation in the size of the population in different generations and years in other areas.

TI  - Sex pheromone of the cloaked pug moth, Eupithecia abietaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), a pest of spruce cones
AB  - The sex pheromone of the cloaked pug moth, Eupithecia abietaria Gotze, an important cone-feeding pest in spruce seed orchards in Europe, was investigated. Chemical and electrophysiological analyses of pheromone gland extracts of female moths and analogous analyses of synthetic hydrocarbons and epoxides of chain length C-19 and C-21 revealed (3Z,6Z,9Z)-3,6,9-nonadecatriene (3Z,6Z,9Z-19:H) and 3Z,6Z-cis-9,10-epoxynonadecadiene (3Z,6Z-cis-9,10-epoxy-19:H) as candidate pheromone components, which were found in a gland extract in a ratio of 95:5. In field trapping experiments, conspecific males were only attracted to a combination of 3Z,6Z,9Z-19:H and the (9S,10R)-enantiomer of 3Z,6Z-cis-9,10-epoxy-19:H. The (9R,10S)-enantiomer was not attractive, which is in agreement with studies on other Eupithecia species, for which males have only been attracted by the (9S,10R)-enantiomer of epoxides. Subsequent experiments showed that E.abietaria males were attracted to a wide range of ratios of the two active compounds and that trap catches increased with increasing dose of the binary blend. A two-component bait containing 300g 3Z,6Z,9Z-19:H and 33g of the (9S,10R)-enantiomer of 3Z,6Z-cis-9,10-epoxy-19:H was efficient for monitoring E.abietaria in spruce seed orchards in southern Sweden, where this species has probably been overlooked as an important pest in the past. With sex pheromones recently identified for two other moths that are major pests on spruce cones, the spruce seed moth, Cydia strobilella L., and the spruce coneworm, Dioryctria abietella Denis & Schiffermuller, pheromone-based monitoring can now be achieved for the whole guild of cone-feeding moths in European spruce seed orchards.

TI  - Area-wide monitoring of potato tuberworm (Phthorimaea operculella) by pheromone trapping in Northern Italy: phenology, spatial distribution and relationships between catches and tuber damage
AB  - The potato tuberworm (PTW) Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is key pest of potato in tropical and subtropical regions. From 2002 onward, PTW has emerged as a problem in the Bologna province, the main potato production area in Northern Italy. Field investigations were performed to study the temporal and spatial dynamics of PTW. Adult moths were monitored using pheromone-baited traps over 3years (2009-2011). Traps were georeferenced and catches were analyzed by geostatistical maps. Each year, the percentage of damaged tubers at harvest was assessed. Pheromone trapping, integrated with temperature-dependent developmental times, showed that PTW completed two generations throughout the potato-growing season; the remaining generations developed in the noncrop season. Maps showed a clumped distribution of PTW at the landscape scale. The hot spots of infestation corresponded to the areas most intensively cropped with potato. Trap catches from hilling to harvesting were linearly and positively correlated with the percentage of damage in 2 out of 3years and in the pooled data set. The present study demonstrated the widening of PTW areal to Northern Italy. In this area, georeferenced pheromone traps were validated as a useful monitoring technique for describing the phenology and distribution of PTW, thus providing crucial knowledge for the rational management of this pest.

TI  - Seasonal responses of the soil meso- and microfauna to litter decomposition in alpine meadow of western Sichuan
AB  - Soil meso- and microfauna are an important part of the soil ecosystem. In order to understand the seasonal dynamics of soil fauna in litters in the alpine meadow of western Sichuan on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, a field experiment using litterbags was conducted to investigate soil meso- and microfauna in 6 kinds of herbaceous plants at the end of snowing season and the growing season. A total of 871 individuals of soil meso- and microfauna were collected, belonging to 1 phylum, 5 classes, 10 orders and 19 families. Among them 562 individuals of soil meso- and microfauna were collected at the end of snowing season, belonging to 1 phylum, 4 classes, 7 orders and 14 families, with Pygmephoridae and Ameroseiidae as dominant groups. At the end of growing season, 309 individuals of soil meso- and microfauna were collected, belonging to 1 phylum, 4 classes, 9 orders and 19 families, Liacaridae and Notodontidae being the dominant groups. The result showed significant seasonal variation of the taxonomic composition and diversity of soil meso- and microfauna communities in litter decomposition of the western Sichuan alpine meadow ecosystem (P < 0.05), with obvious changes in common groups and rare groups. Soil meso- and microfauna community diversity of grasses and broad-leaved weeds showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). Sorensen similarity coefficients of soil animal community in two seasons were below 0.5 in the herbaceous plant litter. Herbaceous species composition did not show significant influence on soil meso- and microfauna community diversity (F> 0.05). The results showed that the environmental factors caused by seasonal changes, especially the average daily temperature and the water content of litters, are the main influencing factors for soil meso- and microfauna community structure in the alpine meadow ecosystem of western Sichuan.

TI  - Stay Out (Almost) All Night: Contrasting Responses in Flight Activity Among Tropical Moth Assemblages
AB  - Variations in diel activity among hyperdiverse tropical communities of moths, despite representing a key component of niche partitioning between species, have barely been studied so far. Using light trapping from dawn to sunset over a 1-year period in French Guiana, we investigated these variations within and between two families of moths (Sphingidae and Saturniidae). Our results revealed contrasting patterns in flight activity at night between Sphingidae and Saturniidae. Sphingidae reached their peak in species richness and abundance between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m., followed by a decrease around 11:00 p.m. to midnight, whereas Saturniidae were continuously present throughout the night, with a peak around midnight. In addition, we found changes in diel activity among some of the most common genera in each family, highlighting distinct behavioral, physiological, and functional traits among taxa. Given differences in flight activity at different taxonomic levels, it is strongly recommended to monitor by light trapping throughout the night to effectively sample saturniid and sphingid assemblages, even though the activity of Sphingidae sharply declines after midnight. These results improve the general natural history information of tropical moths and reinforce the need of further research on the ecological and taxonomic consequences of differences in diel activity.

TI  - Multilocus phylogenetic and geospatial analyses illuminate diversification patterns and the biogeographic history of Malagasy endemic plated lizards (Gerrhosauridae: Zonosaurinae)
AB  - Although numerous studies have attempted to find single unifying mechanisms for generating Madagascar's unique flora and fauna, little consensus has been reached regarding the relative importance of climatic, geologic and ecological processes as catalysts of diversification of the region's unique biota. Rather, recent work has shown that both biological and physical drivers of diversification are best analysed in a case-by-case setting with attention focused on the ecological and life-history requirements of the specific phylogenetic lineage under investigation. Here, we utilize a comprehensive analytical approach to examine evolutionary drivers and elucidate the biogeographic history of Malagasy plated lizards (Zonosaurinae). Data from three genes are combined with fossil information to construct time-calibrated species trees for zonosaurines and their African relatives, which are used to test alternative diversification hypotheses. Methods are utilized for explicitly incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty into downstream analyses. Species distribution models are created for 14 of 19 currently recognized species, which are then used to estimate spatial patterns of species richness and endemicity. Spatially explicit analyses are employed to correlate patterns of diversity with both topographic heterogeneity and climatic stability through geologic time. We then use inferred geographic ranges to estimate the biogeographic history of zonosaurines within each of Madagascar's major biomes. Results suggest constant Neogene and Quaternary speciation with divergence from the African most recent common ancestor similar to 30million years ago when oceanic currents and African rivers facilitated dispersal. Spatial patterns of diversity appear concentrated along coastal regions of northern and southern Madagascar. We find no relationship between either topographic heterogeneity or climatic stability and patterns of diversity. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest that western dry forests were important centres of origin with recent invasion into spiny and rain forest. These data highlight the power of combining multilocus phylogenetic and spatially explicit analyses for testing alternative diversification hypotheses within Madagascar's unique biota and more generally, particularly as applied to phylogenetically and biologically constrained systems.

TI  - Spatial and temporal fluctuations of the abundance of Neotropical cave-dwelling moth Hypena sp (Noctuidae, Lepidoptera) influenced by temperature and humidity
AB  - The present study evaluated the seasonal variation of a population of Hypena sp. in the Gruta Taboa (Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil), in relation to changes in temperature and humidity during the dry (July 1999 and July 2000) and rainy (January 2000 and January 2001) seasons. The Hypena sp. population responded to external seasonality, being distributed closer to the cave entrance during the rainy season, in which temperature and humidity fluctuated around 21 degrees C and 85%, respectively. During the dry season abundance was higher in sections farther from the entrance (deeper sections) (19.2 degrees C temperature and 80% humidity). The results showed that this species is influenced by external environmental factors, even in a tropical region where the external climate fluctuations are lower compared to temperate regions.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Aroga Moth (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) Populations and Damage to Sagebrush in Shrub Steppe Across Varying Elevation
AB  - Spatial and temporal variation in the density of the Aroga moth, Aroga websteri Clarke (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), and in its damage to its host plant, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nuttall), were examined at 38 sites across a shrub steppe landscape in mountain foothills of northern Utah. Sites were sampled from 2008 to 2012 during and after an outbreak of the moth, to assess whether and how local variation in moth abundance, survivorship, and damage to the host plant was accounted for by sagebrush cover, elevation, slope, aspect, or incident solar radiation. As moth numbers declined from a peak in 2009, individual sites had a consistent tendency in subsequent years to support more or fewer defoliator larvae. Local moth abundance was not correlated with sagebrush cover, which declined with elevation, and moth survivorship was highest at intermediate elevations (1,800-2,000 m). North-facing stands of sagebrush, characterized by lower values of incident solar radiation, were found to be especially suitable local habitats for the Aroga moth, as reflected in measures of both abundance and feeding damage. This high habitat suitability may result from favorable microclimate, both in its direct effects on the Aroga moth and in indirect effects through associated vegetative responses. North-facing sites also supported taller and more voluminous sagebrush plants in comparison to south-facing sites. Thus, the moth is reasonably predictable in the sites at which it is likely to occur in greatest numbers, and such sites may be those that in fact have most potential to recover from feeding damage.

TI  - Effects of trap height, location, and spacing on pheromone-baited trap catch efficacy for oriental fruit moths (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in a peach orchard
AB  - The establishment of standardised methods for monitoring the oriental fruit moth Grapholitha molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) requires the identification of factors that significantly affect trap catch efficacy. We examined the effects of trap height, trap location, and inter-trap spacing on trap catches in a conventional peach orchard. Traps were placed at heights of up to 3.0 m above the ground and sets of nine traps were positioned in grids with inter-trap distances of 10-50 m to determine the optimum trap height, location, and spacing. Traps were checked daily over 10 days for males during four periods corresponding to peak moth flight. Moth catches were higher when traps were placed toward the tops (2.5 m) and outside the canopy (3.0 m). Moth catches in traps located upwind and outside tended to be higher than in the central trap for all inter-trap distances. When inter-trap distances were shorter than 30 m, interference between traps occurred. Our results provide an efficient trap distribution for monitoring G. molesta in peach orchards.

The two years of monitoring revealed that Adoxophyes honmai and Homona magnanima occurred four times a year, and Neocalyptis angustilineata did three times. Peak occurrence of A. honmai was recorded in mid-May, from early to mid-July, from late July to early August, and from mid-to late September for the generation, respectively. H. magnanima population peaked during mid-to late May, mid-July, from late August to early September, and from late September to mid-October for the generation, respectively. N. angustilineata showed three clear peaks from late May to early June, in late July, and from early to mid-September for the first, second, and third generation, respectively.

TI  - Confuser (R) MM can be used as an attractant to enable monitoring of the peach leafminer moth, Lyonetia clerkella (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), in peach orchards treated with a mating disrupter
AB  - Sex-pheromone traps baited with a rubber-septum containing 14-methyl-1-octadecene are used to monitor the emergence of adult peach leafminer moths, Lyonetia clerkella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), in peach orchards. This compound is also used as a mating disrupter; large amounts of synthetic 14-methyl-1-octadecene can successfully interfere with the mate-finding behavior of the male moths. In peach orchards treated with mating disrupters, however, conventional rubber-septum lures are ineffective, because mating disrupters interfere with male orientation. In this work we demonstrated that a commercially-available mating disrupter, Confuser(A (R)) MM, can be used as an attractant in orchards treated with mating disrupters. In an indoor flight tunnel experiment, 33-42 % of males pre-exposed to a mating disrupter responded to one to ten Confuser(A (R)) MM dispensers whereas only 8 % responded to a conventional lure made from a rubber-septum impregnated with a relatively small amount of the sex pheromone. The number of male moths captured by traps baited with five dispensers of Confuser(A (R)) MM in orchards treated with mating disrupters was positively correlated with the number of males trapped by use of a conventional rubber-septum lure in untreated orchards. This suggests that Confuser(A (R)) MM can be used as an attractant for monitoring emergence time and relative abundance in an orchard being treated with a mating disrupter.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Grape Root Borer (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) Infestations in Virginia Vineyards and Implications for Sampling
AB  - Grape root borer, Vitacea polistiformis (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) is a potentially destructive pest of grape vines, Vitis spp. in the eastern United States. After feeding on grape roots for approximate to 2 yr in Virginia, larvae pupate beneath the soil surface around the vine base. Adults emerge during July and August, leaving empty pupal exuviae on or protruding from the soil. Weekly collections of pupal exuviae from an approximate to 1-m-diameter weed-free zone around the base of a grid of sample vines in Virginia vineyards were conducted in July and August, 2008-2012, and their distribution was characterized using both nonspatial (dispersion) and spatial techniques. TaylorOs power law showed a significant aggregation of pupal exuviae, based on data from 19 vineyard blocks. Combined use of geostatistical and Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs methods indicated evidence of an aggregated pupal exuviae distribution pattern in seven of the nine blocks used for those analyses. Grape root borer pupal exuviae exhibited spatial dependency within a mean distance of 8.8 m, based on the range values of best-fitted variograms. Interpolated and clustering index-based infestation distribution maps were developed to show the spatial pattern of the insect within the vineyard blocks. The temporal distribution of pupal exuviae showed that the majority of moths emerged during the 3-wk period spanning the third week of July and the first week of August. The spatial distribution of grape root borer pupal exuviae was used in combination with temporal moth emergence patterns to develop a quantitative and efficient sampling scheme to assess infestations.

TI  - Does the prediction of the time of egg hatch of Thaumetopoea processionea (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae) using a frost day/temperature sum model provide evidence of an increasing temporal mismatch between the time of egg hatch and that of budburst of Quercus robur due to recent global warming?
AB  - Thaumetopoea processionea is a serious defoliator of oak and of medical concern whose abundance has consistently increased throughout Europe during the past two decades. This study validates a previously published frost day/temperature sum model for predicting time of egg hatch of this species using five years of recent field data from South-West Germany. This model proved satisfactory for predicting the time of egg hatch of T. processionea. Hence, the model was used to retrospectively predict the time of egg hatch of T. processionea in the Karlsruhe area, which indicates that the time of egg hatch has fluctuated over the past 130 years. In the last two decades, however, predicted time of egg hatch is much earlier than the long-term average due to the increase in winter and early spring temperatures. Comparison of predicted time of egg hatch of T. processionea and long-term records of the time of foliation of its common host Quercus robur revealed that in the study area the temporal advance in the timing of both events was similar. This is not in accordance with recently published research on spring-feeding folivores, which report a diverging trend in the timing of egg hatch and budburst of their host plants as a consequence of human-induced climate change.

TI  - Comparative performance of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on various host plants
AB  - The effect of various host plants; chickpea (varieties Arman, Hashem, Azad and Binivich), bean varieties (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), common bean (Khomein), white kidney bean (Dehghan), red kidney bean (Goli), cowpea (variety Mashhad) and tomato (variety Meshkin) on the life table parameters of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) were evaluated under laboratory conditions (25 +/- A 1 A degrees C, 65 +/- A 5 % RH and a 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod). Records for larval period, pupal period, and development time of H. armigera were longest on tomato (24.9, 15.1, and 45.4 days, respectively) and shortest on chickpea Arman (17.5, 9.1, and 31.7 days, respectively). Among various host plants fecundity (total number of eggs laid per female) was highest (2,665 eggs) on chickpea Arman and the lowest (700 eggs) on tomato. The net reproductive rate (R (0)) was significantly affected by various host plants being highest on chickpea Arman (1,422) and lowest on tomato (111.3 females/female/generation). The highest and lowest intrinsic rates of natural increase (r (m)) were observed on chickpea Arman (0.244 day(-1)) and tomato (0.123 day(-1)) varieties, respectively. Cluster analysis of the life table parameters of H. armigera on various host plants indicated that tomato, in comparison to other plants was an unsuitable host to H. armigera.

TI  - Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae) at the Natural National Park Gorgona, Colombian Pacific
AB  - Gorgona is a continental island at the Pacific coast of Colombia. For 26 years it was a prison but in 1986 it was declared a National Park, and the land was left aside for natural succession. This study presents a list of its Lepidoptera, compares it to a former study and discusses some ecological factors that could promote in situ biodiversity. Butterflies and moths were collected during three trips from October 2010 to May 2011. Butterfly observations were carried out along the main island paths. Baited traps using decomposed fruit, fish and chicken, were installed for three days at each zone (two kinds of bait per site) and sweep net catches were also made between 09:00h and 18:00h. For moths, black and white light traps were located in open areas. Town lights were also checked daily. Percent canopy cover was measured at each collection point. A total of 52 species belonging to seven families were found, of which 30 butterfly and 11 moth species are new records for the island. Cerro Trinidad and Sendero Chonta (22 and 20 species, respectively) were the richest places. Species richness did not decrease with canopy cover. Heliconious sara and Aeria eurimedia were the dominant species, but their distribution did not overlap. Three species were the most widely distributed in the island: H. sara (11 sites, 166 individuals), Calycopis cerata (10 sites, 71 individuals) and Ae. eurimedia (nine sites, 72 individuals). Catoblepia xanthicles occidentalis was found 87 years after the last report. Most species accumulation curves were not asymptotic suggesting that the diversity of the island is higher than expected. This study found twice as much the number of butterflies species reported for Gorgona and is the first record of moths for the island.

TI  - Impact of some insecticides and their mixtures on the population of tomato borers, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in tomato crop at Upper Egypt
AB  - Impact of some insecticides and their mixtures (Emamectin benzoate, Imidaclopride, Chlorfenapyr, Indoxacarb, Profenofos, Pyridalyl, Methomyl and Teflubenzuron) were evaluated against the tomato borers, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) and Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) population in tomato crop at Upper Egypt. Results of LC50 values indicated that Emamectin benzoate was the most toxic compound (LC50 0.461%) against T. absoluta, larvae. The carbamate insecticide, Methomyl, followed this descending order, showing almost similar toxicity, while Teflubenzuron and Chlorfenapyr were less effective (LC50 1.054 and 3.165%, respectively). Pyridalyl was found to be the most effective insecticide against larval stage of H. armigera. (LC50 0.513%). The corresponding toxicities of the other tested insecticides, arranged according to their LC50 values in descending order were as follow: Methomyl, Emamectin benzoate, Profenofos, Imidaclopride, Teflubenzuron, Indoxacarb and Chlorfenapyr. Their LC50 values were ranged between (0.513 and 0.872%). While, their toxicity indexes were ranged between (92.432 and 58.830%, respectively). On the other hand, there were no differences occurred among the treatments. Mean of percent infestation was decreased six weeks after six sprayings, and the per cent reduction in infestation was 79.73, 80.22, 78.41, 80.88, 80.50, 78.30, 79.64 and 78.25% using Emamectin benzoate, Methomyl, Imidaclopride, Pyridalyl, Profenofos, Indoxacarb, Teflubenzuron and Chlorfenapyr, respectively. The efficiency of the tested insecticides was increased with increasing the number of sprays from two to six causing reduction in insect borer infestation ranged between 68.02 and 80.88%, respectively. Generally, the tested insecticides and their mixtures achieved a considerable reduction in T. absoluta and H. armigera population.

TI  - Evaluation of synthetic sex pheromone for monitoring and management of raspberry crown borer Pennisetia marginata (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)
AB  - 1 (E,Z)-3,13-Octadecadienal (E3,Z13-18:Ald) was recently identified as a sex pheromone component of the raspberry crown borer Pennisetia marginata (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae). Although unstable, this pheromone may have utility for monitoring the seasonal abundance and flight phenology of adult P. marginata, as well as for developing control tactics, such as disorienting mate-seeking males. Experiments conducted in raspberry and blackberry crops tested the effect of lure and trap attributes on captures of male P. marginata.2 Increasing lure loads (10, 100 or 1000 mu g) of E3,Z13-18:Ald significantly increased trap captures.3 Freshly prepared lures were significantly more attractive than lures aged for 2-10 days at room temperature.4 White wing traps and white delta traps were more effective than green delta or green bucket traps.5 Trap height in the crop canopy had no effect on the capture of males.6 When sex pheromone components of three other sesiid moth species were added to E3,Z13-18:Ald, the attraction of male P. marginata was reduced and, thus, these components were identified as pheromone antagonists.7 Pheromone-based mass trapping with 25 wing traps per hectare reduced captures of males in traps baited with a low-dose (10 mu g) pheromone lure by 67-87% in 2011.

TI  - Impact of the leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) and bleeding canker disease on horse-chestnut: direct effects and interaction
AB  - 1 The leaf miner Cameraria ohridella and bleeding canker disease (BCD) are invasive organisms causing severe damage to horse-chestnut trees in Europe.2 Their impact and potential interaction were investigated by monitoring infestation and disease symptoms on 193 European horse-chestnuts Aesculus hippocastanum L. and 46 red horse-chestnuts Aesculus carnea J. Zeyh. over a 10-year period from 2002 to 2012.3 Cameraria ohridella damaged up to 75% of the total leaf area of A. hippocastanum, but it had no influence on stem radial growth or general tree condition. Aesculus carnea was rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested A. hippocastanum.4 BCD, in contrast, was responsible for the death or removal of 11% of A. hippocastanum and 27% of A. carnea, and surviving trees showed a decrease in growth rate and decline in crown density.5 Cameraria ohridella was more abundant on larger A. hippocastanum, whereas BCD was more prevalent amongst young, fast-growing A. hippocastanum, which resulted in a partial separation of the moth and disease between trees and habitats, as well as in the wider environment.6 Trees with higher rates of leaf miner damage generally had a lower incidence of BCD and there was no evidence that C. ohridella either facilitated the spread of the disease or accentuated its impact.

TI  - The growing abundance of Helicoverpa armigera in Hungary and its areal shift estimation
AB  - The invasive Cotton Bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hubner, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) has become a serious pest of several agricultural plants since its first mass occurrence in Hungary (1993). During the decades of the species' presence in the Carpathian Basin, a remarkable fluctuation was detected in its abundance and flight phenology. We analysed long term light trap records and meteorological data to identify the possible factors behind these fluctuations. This study presents an overview of the areal dispersion and the rate of accumulation and flight phenology of this invasive pest, from its first Hungarian mass occurrence until the present, focusing on the influence of climatic factors on the Hungarian distribution of H. armigera. According to our estimation, this pest occupied 94% of the area of Hungary within eight years. There were significant differences in pest pressure by regions, corroborated by the average number of trapped specimens and the regression coefficients. Fluctuations of specimen numbers in the different years are clearly visible in the flight phenology diagrams, which depend on the rate of the growing abundance. The results indicate that abiotic elements may also play a significant role in the areal dispersion of this important invasive insect.

TI  - More than an empty case: a non invasive technique for monitoring the Australian critically endangered golden sun moth, Synemon plana (Lepidoptera: Castniidae)
AB  - Monitoring programs for butterflies and moths are focused on the adult stage, rarely considering other life stages. Transect-based counts of adults and searches for empty pupal cases have been suggested as standard monitoring protocols for the critically endangered golden sun moth Synemon plana in Australia. To date, surveys and monitoring have focused only on counts of adults. However, undertaking such counts is constrained by the short adult life of the species (1-2 days), and the fact that prevailing weather conditions can seriously influence detectability. We tested whether empty pupal cases of S. plana can be used to supplement the monitoring of adults and whether this technique can be undertaken by citizen scientists. Volunteers from Canberra (Australia) collected 650 pupal cases from 11 grassland areas. The cases were found in native grasslands and in grassland comprised entirely of the exotic Chilean needle grass (Nassella neesiana). Pupal cases of S. plana were found to be durable, with most persisting in the field for greater than 3 weeks after first sighting, and exhibited a male biased sex ratio. This study demonstrates that detection of empty pupal cases provides a potential additional tool to monitor S. plana that is not dependent on the restrictions of prevailing weather conditions and time of day, and can be undertaken by citizen scientists.

TI  - Mitochondrial lineage sorting in action - historical biogeography of the Hyles euphorbiae complex (Sphingidae, Lepidoptera) in Italy
AB  - Background: Mitochondrial genes are among the most commonly used markers in studies of species' phylogeography and to draw conclusions about taxonomy. The Hyles euphorbiae complex (HEC) comprises six distinct mitochondrial lineages in the Mediterranean region, of which one exhibits a cryptic disjunct distribution. The predominant mitochondrial lineage in most of Europe, euphorbiae, is also present on Malta; however, it is nowadays strangely absent from Southern Italy and Sicily, where it is replaced by 'italica'. A separate biological entity in Italy is further corroborated by larval colour patterns with a congruent, confined suture zone along the Northern Apennines. By means of historic DNA extracted from museum specimens, we aimed to investigate the evolution of the mitochondrial demographic structure of the HEC in Italy and Malta throughout the Twentieth Century.Results: At the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the European mainland lineages were also present at a moderate frequency in Southern Italy and Sicily. The proportion of 'italica' then steadily increased in this area from below 60 percent to near fixation in about 120 years. Thus, geographical sorting of mitochondrial lineages in the HEC was not as complete then as the current demography suggests. The pattern of an integral 'italica' core region and a disjunct euphorbiae distribution evolved very recently. To explain these strong demographic changes, we propose genetic drift due to anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation in combination with an impact from recent climate warming that favoured the spreading of the potentially better adapted 'italica' populations.Conclusions: The pattern of geographically separated mitochondrial lineages is commonly interpreted as representing long term separated entities. However, our results indicate that such a pattern can emerge surprisingly quickly, even in a widespread and rather common taxon. We thus caution against drawing hasty taxonomic conclusions from biogeographical patterns of mitochondrial markers derived from modern sampling alone.

TI  - Species composition and temporal activity of Arctiinae (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) in two cerrado vegetation types
AB  - Arctiinae moths include nearly 11,000 species worldwide, of which approximately 700 species occur in the Brazilian Cerrado. The aim of this study was to describe the species composition of Arctiinae, as well as the variation in annual and nightly moth activity, in two Cerrado vegetation types. We sampled moths one night per month from September 2008 to June 2009, in the gallery forest and in the cerrado sensu strict in the Jardim Botanico de Brasilia. We collected 395 tiger moths belonging to 65 morphospecies; 74% of the species belonged to the tribe Arctiini and 26% to Lithosiini. Thirty-one species (47.7%) occurred only in the gallery forest, 13 (20%) occurred only in the cerrado sensu stricto, and 21(32.3%) occurred in both vegetation types. Additionally, we found the greatest species richness between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., and these hours were associated with 21 and 22 species, respectively. Most species (51.8%) were active for up to three hours during the night. In general, the species composition differed between the dry and rainy seasons, and the similarity of the fauna also varied hourly. Based on our results, we suggest that rapid inventories of Arctiinae be performed in both rainy and dry seasons, and sampling should be carried out the entire night.

TI  - Silkworm moths inventory in their natural tapia forest habitat (Madagascar): diversity, population dynamics and host plants
AB  - Endemic silk moths (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) in Madagascar have been collected and exploited for centuries by local populations either for food or as a source of silk cocoons from which textiles are made. Moth natural forest habitat has also been degraded, leading to a drastic decrease in silk moth populations. However, very few scientific reports highlighted these observations well known by the local people. We have inventoried silk moths species in tapia (Uapaca bojeri Baill.) forests located in the central highlands of Madagascar. Inventories have been conducted during one year from August 2009 to July 2010 by sampling transects in Imamo forests. Three species of Lasiocampidae belonging to two genera were found: Borocera cajani Vinson, Borocera marginepunctata Guerin-Meneville and Europtera punctillata Guenee. These three silk moth species are endemic to Madagascar but only one (B. cajani) is commercially exploited in the silk industry. The habitat, host plants, abundance, life cycle and feeding behaviour of these species in their natural habitat are described.

TI  - Arctiinae (Lepidoptera, Arctiidae) occurring in a pasture area in eastern Amazon in Altamira, Para, Brazil
AB  - This study evaluated the Arctiinae fauna of a pasture area in Altamira, Para, eastern Amazon, using light traps. The moths were captured at every new moon phase, two nights per phase, from December 2008 to November 2010. We evaluated the following parameters: richness, abundance, dominance, constancy, diversity indexes and evenness (Shannon H' and E'; Brillouin H and E), and Berger-Parker dominance (BP). Richness estimates were made by nonparametric procedures: Bootstrap, Chaol, Chao2, Jackknife 1, Jackknife2 and Michaelis-Mentem. We captured a total of 910 specimens belonging to 85 species of Arctiinae. Values of parameters for the total period were: H' = 2.58, E' = 0.581, H = 2.45, E = 0.576 and BP = 0.433. Both richness and abundance were higher in 2009-2010, while diversity and Shannon and Brillouin evenness were higher for the year 2008-2009. Estimators predicted an increase between 18.8% to 85.9% in species richness.

TI  - How cold was the Little Ice Age? A proxy-based reconstruction from Finland applying modern analogues of fossil midge assemblages
AB  - Climate dynamics during the past ca. 700 years in southern Finland were reconstructed using fossil midge (Diptera:Nematocera) assemblages aiming to estimate quantitatively the temperature change that has occurred from the Little Ice Age to the present. Midge stratigraphies of two sediment cores from eastern and southern Finland were chosen to be examined for temperature inferences utilizing the modern analogue technique. The new midge-based temperature inference model had a coefficient of determination of 0.901 and a prediction error of 0.498 A degrees C, showing improvement over the previous Finnish models. The combined curve of the inferred temperatures derived from both of the cores showed a decrease towards ca. 1700 AD, when temperatures were approximately 1 A degrees C cooler than the past 700 years average and almost 2 A degrees C colder than present. The temperatures began to increase in southern Finland from 1800 AD and in eastern Finland from 1900 AD onwards. The highest temperatures were reached at the top of the core, representing the present climate warming. Although there was slight overestimation in the recent inferred values, the reconstructed trends were in close correspondence with the previous proxy-based, historical, and measured data that suggests that the reconstruction was realistic and reliable.

TI  - Molecular Cloning, Characterization, and mRNA Expression of Two Cryptochrome Genes in Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
AB  - Light is a major environmental signal for insect circadian. In this study, we isolated two cryptochrome (cry) genes from Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RACE-PCR strategies, designated as Ha-cry1 (GenBank accession GQ896502) and Ha-cry2 (GenBank accession GQ896503). Ha-CRY1 encoded a fly-like protein of 548 amino acids, while Ha-CRY2 encoded a mammal-like protein of 657 amino acids. Both of these proteins had two conserved domains: a DNA photolyase domain and a flavin adenine dinucleotide(FAD) binding seven domain, and alignment of the amino acid sequence indicated that there was a high degree of homology between the CRYs of H. armigera and other insects. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that: 1) Ha-cry1 and Ha-cry2 mRNA expressions were neither organ-specific nor developmental-stage-specific. 2) Under the light D dark cycle (16: 8 L: D), Ha-cry1 abundance tended to increase during the day, then decrease in the night, whereas the expression pattern of Ha-cry2 was opposite. 3) The cyclings of Ha-cry1 and Ha-cry2 expression were disturbed by constant light and darkness. Our study has significant importance for the further study of the functions of the Ha-cry genes and potential control of the cotton bollworm.

TI  - Sedimentary chydorid (Cladocera) ephippia in relation to lake ecological quality in the Austrian Alps
AB  - Research on chydorid (Crustacea: Cladocera: Chydoridae) reproduction is scarce and very little is known about the dynamics of parthenogenetic (asexual) and gamogenetic (sexual) reproduction modes in these cyclical parthenogens. The paleolimnological approach has a lot to offer to this research since chydorid carapaces (indicative of asexual reproduction) and ephippia (indicative of sexual reproduction) are identifiable in lake sediments. In the current study, we examined historical changes in chydorid reproduction patterns in an Austrian Alpine lake with the objective to explore reproductive shifts under limnological variability and with the hypothesis that sexual reproduction intensifies under unfavourable environmental conditions. For this, we utilised subfossil remains from a sediment sequence covering the past similar to 300 years in a high Alpine lake, lake Oberer Landschitzsee. The results suggested that in-lake processes likely changed as a response to post-Little Ice Age (LIA) climate warming. Indeed, the benthic quality - indicated by the chironomid-based benthic quality index (BQI) - deteriorated, and the productivity - indicated by organic matter in the sediment - increased. The chydorid community exhibited dramatic shifts in the post-LIA section of the core, around 1850-1950 AD, when the two dominant species Alona (A.) affinis and A. quadrangularis were outcompeted by Acroperus harpae, Alonella excisa, and Chydorus (C.) sphaericus-type and their reproduction gradually shifted towards the dominance of sexual reproduction. The community shift and prevalence of sexual reproduction coincided with the period of unfavourable limnological conditions, evidenced by low BQI values and higher organic content. Therefore, we suggest that the intensified sexual reproduction was a local response to deteriorated benthic conditions and a vigorous adaptive mechanism to ensure successful diapause and genetic variability under environmental change. The results give reason to suggest that fossil chydorid assemblages and ephippia indicate the ecological quality of lake ecosystems and, thus, they can be used as additional proxies in future assessments of the lake ecological status.

TI  - Host Status of Commercial Mango Cultivars to Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in South Africa
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the host status of commercially cultivated mango fruit, Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae) to Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in South Africa. T. leucotreta was monitored with parapheromone traps in mango orchards in Limpopo and Mpumalanga from 2007 to 2010. Fruit were inspected for the presence of T. leucotreta eggs in mango orchards. Mango fruit of the cultivars 'Tommy Atkins', 'Kent', 'Keitt', and 'Sensation' were artificially infested with T. leucotreta eggs on the tree to determine if the larvae were able to develop in fruit. Mature fruit of these cultivars were harvested and were then exposed to T. leucotreta eggs and the larval development monitored. Before harvest, fruit were inspected for natural infestations and a packhouse survey was conducted during the 2009-2010 season to determine if any infested fruit were present. T. leucotreta was present in all mango orchards where monitoring was done with traps but no eggs were found on the fruit, which suggests the presence of antixenosis. Development occurred in mature harvested fruit of all cultivars that had been exposed to T. leucotreta eggs. Depending on the cultivar, between 0 and 5.05% of immature fruit on the tree supported development and demonstrate antibiosis. No naturally infested fruit were found in the orchards or during the packhouse survey. Mango in South Africa is not a natural host for T. leucotreta. Mature mango fruit is an acceptable host for T. leucotreta larval development under artificial conditions. The latex plays an important role in the resistance mechanism of mango fruit to T. leucotreta.

TI  - Evaluation of Canola Cultivars for Resistance to Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Using Demographic Parameters
AB  - The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is one of the most important pests on a wide range of crops worldwide. The antibiotic resistance of 10 canola cultivars ('Sarigol', 'Hayula(420'), 'Opera', 'Okapi', 'Modena', 'RGS(003'), 'Zarfam', 'Licord', 'Talaye', and 'SLM046') to H. arimgera was evaluated using demographic parameters including life table, reproduction, development, and adult longevity. Larval period ranged from 18.8 to 16.1 d on Hayula(420) and RGS(003), respectively. The longest development time of immature stages was on Sarigol and Hayula(420) (36.8 d) and the shortest one was on Zarfam (34.8 d). The highest daily and total fecundity (1,082.4 and 254.8 eggs, respectively) was on RGS(003) and the lowest was on Talaye (517.0 and 41.4 eggs, respectively). The r(m) values varied from 0.153 on Sarigol to 0.179 on Opera. The net reproductive rate (R-0) was calculated to be lowest on Talaye (157.4) and highest on RGS(003) (331.5). The comparison of demographic parameters of H. armigera on different cultivars of canola and the cluster analysis revealed that Hayula(420), Talaye, Sarigol, and SLM046 were the most resistant cultivars to this insect. Such results could be useful to develop an integrated pest management strategy of H. armigera on canola cultivars.

TI  - Ecological responses of aquatic invertebrates to climate change over the past similar to 400 years in a climatically ultra-sensitive lake in the Niedere Tauern Alps (Austria)
AB  - A sediment core covering the past similar to 400 years from Lake Moaralmsee (central Austrian Alps), which has previously been judged to be ultra-sensitive to climate change due to its unusually cold water, was examined for its fossil invertebrates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the faunal assemblages had experienced changes in their composition during periods of the Little Ice Age and recent climate warming. Although there was some general lag between the community changes of these animal groups, the faunal dynamics showed significant correlation between the principal component axes. A mutual break point in the assemblages occurred in the beginning of the 20th century corresponding to increased global and Alpine air temperatures. A gradual decrease in diversity was detected for chironomids, but the only major change in the diversity of Cladocera occurred between similar to 1900 and 1950AD when it was markedly lower. The results indicate that Lake Moaralmsee has gone through clear changes in its invertebrate fauna during the past centuries that were most likely related to climate warming, with the most dramatic changes occurring almost a century ago.

TI  - Factors Responsible for Changes in Leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Species Composition on Orchards and Vineyards 1974-2015, in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand
AB  - Leafrollers are polyphagous pests whose larvae damage fruit and cause market access problems for fruit crops exported from New Zealand. Leafroller larvae and pupae were collected mainly from four fruit crops, but also from hedges, ornamental trees, and understory weeds in orchards and vineyards of Hawke's Bay, a major fruit production region. Samples were collected from 1974 to 1977 and 1993 to 2015. This timespan was divided into periods that broadly coincided with broad-spectrum insecticide management, the transition to selective insecticides, and the full implementation of integrated fruit production (IFP) programs in apples, grapes, and stone fruit. Eight tortricid species were identified, but the accidentally introduced Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and two native species, Ctenopseustis obliquana (Walker) and Planotortrix octo Dugdale, comprised 95% of the samples. The proportions of these three species varied according to interactions between four factors: pest management regime, collection period, property location, and host plant. In the 1970s under broad-spectrum insecticide programs, the native species dominated on all hosts. By the mid-late 1990s when IFP was introduced, all the main leafroller species were in decline. However, E. postvittana declined to a lesser extent than the two native species, and consequently, it became relatively more prominent. This change in species composition was delayed in two districts where localized cases of organophosphate insecticide resistance occurred in C. obliquana and P. octo. From 2000 onwards, E. postvittana was the dominant species in all districts and on all hosts, albeit with a much-reduced pest status, except on hedges and ornamental trees where C. obliquana prevailed.

TI  - Radial Growth and Wood Density Reflect the Impacts and Susceptibility to Defoliation by Gypsy Moth and Climate in Radiata Pine
AB  - Drought stress causes a reduction in tree growth and forest productivity, which could be aggravated by climate warming and defoliation due to moth outbreaks. We investigate how European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar L., Lepidoptera: Erebidae) outbreak and related climate conditions affected growth and wood features in host and non-host tree species in north-western Spain. There, radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) plantations and chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) stands were defoliated by the moth larvae, whereas Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) was not defoliated. The gypsy moth outbreak peaked in 2012 and 2013, and it was preceded by very warm spring conditions in 2011 and a dry-warm 2011-2012 winter. Using dendrochronology we compared growth responses to climate and defoliation of host species (radiata pine, chestnut) with the non-host species (Maritime pine). We also analyzed wood density derived from X-ray densitometry in defoliated and non-defoliated trees of radiata pine. We aimed to: (i) disentangle the relative effects of defoliation and climate stress on radial growth, and (ii) characterize defoliated trees of radiata pine according to their wood features (ring-width, maximum and minimum density). Radial growth during the outbreak (2012-2013) decreased on average 74% in defoliated (>50% of leaf area removed) trees of radiata pine, 43% in defoliated trees of chestnut, and 4% in non-defoliated trees of Maritime pine. After applying a BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) type analysis, we concluded that the difference in the pattern of radial growth before and during the defoliation event was more likely due to the differences in climate between these two periods. Radiata pines produced abundant latewood intra-annual density fluctuations in 2006 and 2009 in response to wet summer conditions, suggesting a high climatic responsiveness. Minimum wood density was lower in defoliated than in non-defoliated trees of radiata pine prior to the outbreak, but increased during the outbreak. The pre-outbreak difference in minimum wood density suggests that the trees most affected by the outbreak produced tracheids with wider lumen and were more susceptible to drought stress. Results of this study illustrate (i) that the pattern of radial growth alone may be not a good indicator for reconstructing past defoliation events and (ii) that wood variables are reliable indicators for assessing the susceptibility of radiata pine to defoliation by the gypsy moth.

TI  - Small sample, substantial contribution: additions to the Honduran hawkmoth (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) fauna based on collections from a mountainous protected area (Cusuco National Park)
AB  - With the largest part of diversity in the world absorbed by invertebrates, ignoring invertebrates in biodiversity surveys and monitoring of areas under conservation would give a strongly incomplete image. The poor knowledge of most invertebrate taxa and their enormous diversity limits most surveys to the better-studied groups. Hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) are one of the more charismatic and well-known groups among the Lepidoptera and hence a valuable group commonly used in biodiversity research. In this small-scale study, 42 museum specimens of sphingids from Cusuco National Park (Cort,s, Honduras) were identified and compared to recent published accounts. This yielded three new country records and, in addition, four new regional records for the park. Some of the additions to the Honduran fauna probably result from recent taxonomic changes. However, the several contributions using a small collection of this well-studied group in an area which has attracted previous research interest, demonstrate the incomplete data availability and the necessity for more rigorous surveying. Several new records concern high altitude species, indicating the data gap in mountains. As elevation is an important determinant of sphingid community structure, sampling across an altitudinal range is recommended. This study also underpins the usefulness of a reference collection-based approach in particular, as many hawkmoth species are identified using subtle diagnostic characters.

TI  - Modeling the interaction of physiological time, seasonal weather patterns, and delayed mating on population dynamics of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
AB  - The effect of delaying female mating on population growth in codling moth (Cydia pomonella (L.)) was found to act on a physiological time (degree-day) basis and was predictable using a simple quadratic equation. When combined with previous work on degree-day based mortality, we were able to evaluate how the magnitude of population reduction and survival varied between sites, years, and generations at locations in California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington states. In general, reductions in population growth associated with females mating 1-3 days after emergence were greater in warmer areas and during warmer times of the year. In any given year and location, the temperature profiles during peak flight were crucial in determining the population reductions, but over an 11-year period, the average seasonal temperature profile was more important. During the overwintering generation, conditions were relatively mild in all locations and only minor differences were observed in population growth rates between locations. Populations experiencing 1-3 days delay in female mating were reduced 8, 19 and 32 % compared to populations experiencing no delay, respectively. During the first summer generation, population reductions doubled compared to those seen in the overwintering generation. During the second summer flight, reductions in population growth rate at the three cooler locations decreased, while they increased in the warmer California location. Overall, the results show delayed mating can help understand how population growth is related to environmental conditions experienced naturally by insect populations and will help guide studies of the mechanisms of mating disruption, a technique used for pest suppression in agricultural and forest systems.

TI  - Phylogeny and evolutionary history of the silkworm
AB  - The silkworm, Bombyx mori, played an important role in the old Silk Road that connected ancient Asia and Europe. However, to date, there have been few studies of the origins and domestication of this species using molecular methods. In this study, DNA sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear loci were used to infer the phylogeny and evolutionary history of the domesticated silkworm and its relatives. All of the phylogenetic analyses indicated a close relationship between the domesticated silkworm and the Chinese wild silkworm. Domestication was estimated to have occurred about 4100 years ago (ya), and the radiation of the different geographic strains of B. mori about 2000 ya. The Chinese wild silkworm and the Japanese wild silkworm split about 23600 ya. These estimates are in good agreement with the fossil evidence and historical records. In addition, we show that the domesticated silkworm experienced a population expansion around 1000 ya. The divergence times and the population dynamics of silkworms presented in this study will be useful for studies of lepidopteran phylogenetics, in the genetic analysis of domestic animals, and for understanding the spread of human civilizations.

TI  - Genetic variability and demographic history of Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) populations from Brazil inferred by mtDNA sequences
AB  - Intra-and inter-population genetic variability and the demographic history of Heliothis virescens (F.) populations were evaluated by using mtDNA markers (coxI, coxII and nad6) with samples from the major cotton-and soybean-producing regions in Brazil in the growing seasons 2007/08, 2008/09 and 2009/10. AMOVA indicated low and non-significant genetic structure, regardless of geographical scale, growing season or crop, with most of genetic variation occurring within populations. Clustering analyzes also indicated low genetic differentiation. The haplotype network obtained with combined datasets resulted in 35 haplotypes, with 28 exclusive occurrences, four of them sampled only from soybean fields. The minimum spanning network showed star-shaped structures typical of populations that underwent a recent demographic expansion. The recent expansion was supported by other demographic analyzes, such as the Bayesian skyline plot, the unimodal distribution of paired differences among mitochondrial sequences, and negative and significant values of neutrality tests for the Tajima's D and Fu's F-S parameters. In addition, high values of haplotype diversity ((H) over cap) and low values of nucleotide diversity (pi), combined with a high number of low frequency haplotypes and values of theta(pi)<theta(W), suggested a recent demographic expansion of H. virescens populations in Brazil. This demographic event could be responsible for the low genetic structure currently found; however, haplotypes present uniquely at the same geographic regions and from one specific host plant suggest an initial differentiation among H. virescens populations within Brazil.

TI  - Historical distribution of the oak processionary moth Thaumetopoea processionea in Europe suggests recolonization instead of expansion
AB  - 1 The oak processionary moth Thaumetopoea processionea (Notodontidae) is presently distributed in almost all European countries and in part of the Middle East. In the North, its range limit passes through the Netherlands and Germany, and the southern part of Poland and Ukraine. In the South, the species is present in all the countries located on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, in Anatolia, and in the mountains surrounding the Dead Sea Transform. 2 Using information from museum and personal collections, the available literature and other relevant datasets, we show that the species was already largely distributed throughout Europe before 1920. The available data do not provide any evidence of any long-term latitudinal shift of the species betwen 1750 and 2010. 3 In the northernmost part of its range, the population dynamics of the species is characterized by important fluctuations. We studied their pattern in Belgium, the Netherlands and part of Germany, after the apparent regional disappearance of the species during the first half of the 20th Century. The data suggest a continuous extent of the apparent distribution of the insect between 1970 and 2009, at a rate of approximately 7.5 km per year. 4 To explain the present distribution of the species, we discuss possible improvements of environmental conditions that could have triggered local population increases and favoured dispersal to adjacent areas. In addition, human activity, including the commercial movements of infested nursery trees, was recently suspected to be another source of spread over geographical barriers.

TI  - Introduction, Establishment, and Potential Geographic Range of Carmenta sp nr ithacae (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), a Biological Control Agent for Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae) in Australia
AB  - Parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.), a major weed causing economic, environmental, and human and animal health problems in Australia and several countries in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific, has been a target for biological control in Australia since the mid-1970s. Nine species of insects and two rust fungi have been introduced as biological control agents into Australia. These include Carmenta sp. nr ithacae, a root feeding agent from Mexico. The larvae of C. sp. nr ithacae bore through the stem-base into the root where they feed on the cortical tissue of the taproot. During 1998-2002, 2,816 larval-infested plants and 387 adults were released at 31 sites across Queensland, Australia. Evidence of field establishment was first observed in two of the release sites in central Queensland in 2004. Annual surveys at these sites and nonrelease sites during 2006-2011 showed wide variations in the incidence and abundance of C. sp. nr ithacae between years and sites. Surveys at three of the nine release sites in northern Queensland and 16 of the 22 release sites in central Queensland confirmed the field establishment of C. sp. nr ithacae in four release sites and four nonrelease sites, all in central Queensland. No field establishment was evident in the inland region or in northern Queensland. A CLIMEX model based on the native range distribution of C. sp. nr ithacae predicts that areas east of the dividing range along the coast are more suitable for field establishment than inland areas. Future efforts to redistribute this agent should be restricted to areas identified as climatically favorable by the CLIMEX model.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Helicoverpa zea and Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Moths in Pheromone Traps across Agricultural Landscapes in Arkansas
AB  - Pheromone trap captures of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Heliothis virescens (F.) from 2002 - 2005 were used to examine the distribution of these species across a multiple crop environment in southeast Arkansas. The greatest number of H. virescens moths was collected during 2003, but densities were low compared with H. zea throughout the study. Overall, fewer H. virescens moths were captured next to Bt corn and Bt cotton than next to nonBt cotton and early-maturing soybean. A significant relationship was not detected between pheromone trap captures of H. virescens and the percentage of these moths that fed on cotton as larvae. More H. zea moths were captured in traps located next to Bt corn and nonBt corn during the month of June than in traps located next to cotton, sorghum, or soybean, whereas traps located adjacent to early- and late-maturing varieties of soybean, Bt cotton, nonBt cotton, and grain sorghum captured greater numbers of moths than those traps located next to corn during July. Therefore, the distribution of H. zea appeared to be influenced by corn acreage during the month of June. Later in the season, this species was widely distributed across the agricultural landscape. Compared with 2 other regions of AR, fewer H. zea moths were captured during the month of June and more H. virescens moths were captured during August in Mississippi Co., an area of intense cotton production.

TI  - Origin and taxonomic status of the Palearctic population of the stem borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
AB  - The major pest of maize in Mediterranean Europe, the stem borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has a fragmented distribution, north and south of the Sahara. The present study aimed: (1) to clarify the uncertain taxonomic status of the Palearctic and sub-Saharan populations which were first considered as different species and later on as subspecies (Sesamia nonagrioides nonagrioides and Sesamia nonagrioides botanephaga) and (2) to investigate the origin of the Palearctic population which extends from Spain to Iran, outside what is considered typical for this mainly tropical genus. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of both populations using one nuclear and two mitochondrial genes. The sub-Saharan taxon was fragmented in two isolated populations (West and East) whose mitochondrial genes were distant by 2.3%. The Palearctic population was included in the East African clade and its genes were close or identical to those of a population from Central Ethiopia, where the species was discovered for the first time. Similarly, in Africa, the alleles of the nuclear gene were distributed mainly in two West and East clades, whereas some Palearctic alleles belonged to the West clade. The Palearctic population originated therefore from East and West Africa and is the progeny of the cross between these two African populations. The main species concepts were in agreement, leading to the conclusion that the three populations are still conspecific. In the surveyed regions, the species therefore does not include two subspecies but three isolated populations. The Palearctic population suffered from severe bottlenecks that resulted in the fixation of one East African mitochondrial genome and the large reduction in its genetic diversity compared to the African populations. The data suggest that natural colonization of the Palearctic region was more plausible than human introduction. The allelic distribution of the Palearctic population was similar to that of species that survived the last glaciation. It is concluded that the African populations expanded during the last interglacial, crossed the Sahara and mixed in North Africa where fixation of the East mitochondrial genome occurred. The species then colonized Europe westward through only one eastern entrance. The coalescent-based estimate of the time to the ancestor of the Palearctic population was 108 000 years, which is consistent with this scenario.

TI  - Forest Fragments' Contribution to the Natural Biological Control of Spodoptera frugiperda Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Maize
AB  - The present work evaluated the influence of forest distance on predatory solitary wasps' abundance and richness and its relation to the natural biological control of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda Smith - Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in maize. The study consisted of two parallel lines of six experimental maize plots located at an increasing distance from a forest edge. Four trap-nests were placed in the vertices of each plot of the first line to evaluate the abundance and species richness of predatory solitary wasps. The larvae of the fall armyworm were sampled weekly by inspecting ten randomly chosen plants per plot. Predatory solitary wasp abundance (but not species richness) decreased whilst the fall armyworm abundance increased with the distance from the forest. Moreover, population densities of predatory solitary wasps and the fall armyworm were negatively correlated. Results suggested that the crop plantations located near forest fragments might benefit from the reduced pest problems as a result of increased natural biological control.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Temporal and Spatial Patterns of Dogwood Borer (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) Infestations in Newly Planted Apple Orchards
AB  - The temporal and small-scale spatial patterns of infestation by larval dogwood borer, Synanthedon scitula (Harris) were studied from 2002 to 2004 in two newly planted apple orchards in West Virginia and Virginia. Rootstock, tree variety, and cultural management practice were significantly associated with the presence and extent of dogwood borer infestation. In West Virginia, infestation was significantly greater on trees planted on M. 26 rootstock compared with M. 7 rootstock, and on trees fitted with tree guards compared with other trunk treatments. In Virginia, the proportion of infested trees was significantly greater for 'Idared' tree varieties compared with 'Buckeye Gala', and on trees fitted with tree guards compared with other trunk treatments. Median polishing technique was used to separate variability in the infestation data into large-scale variation (trend) induced mainly by treatments and small-scale variation. Variography was used to study the median-polished residuals of infestation that represent the small-scale variation. The results of variogram analysis of the median-polished residuals indicated that there were moderate to high degrees of aggregation in dogwood borer infestations on neighboring apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh.) with ranges of spatial autocorrelation from 2.8 to 17.0 m. The spatial patterns of the aggregation of infestation in the West Virginia and Virginia orchards were best described by the spherical and exponential semiovariogram models, respectively. Interpolated surface maps of the median-polished residuals revealed local hot spots, which were generally more prevalent within tree guard treatments, and were typically found where dogwood borer infestations originated. Results are discussed in relation to the sampling and management of dogwood borer larvae.

TI  - Effects of Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) Damage on Sugarcane Yield
AB  - Feeding by lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), larvae on sugarcane (a complex hybrid of Saccharum spp.) causes leaf damage, dead hearts, and dead plants that can result in stand and yield loss. A 2-yr greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine sugarcane variety and plant age-specific feeding responses to E. lignosellus. Plants growing from single-eye setts of three varieties were exposed to a single generation of E. lignosellus larvae beginning at the three-, five-, and seven-leaf stages. Results indicated that the physical damage and resulting yield loss of plants attacked by E. lignosellus larvae were dependent on the variety and leaf stage at which they were infested. Significantly more plant damage was observed in all three varieties when infested at the three-than at the seven-leaf stage. Larvae caused significantly more plant damage and reduced yield in CP 89-2143 than in CP 78-1628. Tiller production increased in CP78D1628 and CP 88-1762 when infested at the three-leaf stage, whereas tiller production, biomass and sugar yield decreased in CP 89-2143 when infested at all leaf stages, compared with the untreated control. There was no reduction in yield when CP 78-1628 was infested at the three-or five-leaf stages. Biomass was reduced in CP 88-1762 when plants were infested at any of the leaf stages, but sugar yield was reduced only when infested at the seven-leaf stage. These results indicate that compensation in response to E. lignosellus damage was variety dependent and declined with the delay in infestation time.

TI  - Does landscape composition alter the spatiotemporal distribution of the pine processionary moth in a pine plantation forest?
AB  - Landscape composition and physiognomy affect community structure and species distribution across space and time. The pine processionary moth (PPM) (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Den. & Schiff., Lepidoptera, Notodontidae) is a common pine defoliator throughout southern Europe and Mediterranean countries. We surveyed the spatiotemporal distribution of the PPM in a pine plantation forest in southwestern France and used the density of the winter nests as a proxy for population density. The study spanned 4 years (2005-2008) and showed a high temporal variability in nest density. We found a strong edge effect with nest densities at stand edges more than twice as large as within-stand densities. At the landscape scale, the spatial distribution of the moth exhibited a significant spatial autocorrelation in 3 out of 4 years of our study. The spatial scales of the autocorrelation ranged from ca. 2 km to more than 22 km. We found a positive correlation between spatial distributions corresponding to certain sampling years, but the relationship was not systematic. Landscape configuration appeared to be an important driver of the PPM spatial pattern. Bivariate Moran's I correlograms showed that patch richness density as well as the percentage of local landscape covered by various land uses were correlated with population density. The study showed that accounting for landscape characteristics may be important in order to understand forest insect pest distribution, even in cases where the host species is abundant and homogeneously distributed throughout the study area, e.g., pure plantation forests.

TI  - Phenology and behaviour of the clearwing moth, Monopetalotaxis candescens (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), associated with cultivated rooibos, Aspalathus linearis (Fabaceae), in South Africa
AB  - Production of 'rooibos' or red bush tea from Aspalathus linearis (Burman f) Dahlgren (Fabaceae) is unique within the greater Cederberg region, Western Cape Province, South Africa. One of the principal insect pests associated with A. linearis production is the root-boring clearwing moth, Monopetalotaxis candescens Felder & Felder (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae). Annual moth flights peak during November/December, resulting in young plantations being targeted during the hot, dry summer conditions prevailing at this time. Average infestation levels progressively increased from 28 +/- 2 % in year 1, to 53 +/- 2% and 72 +/- 1 % in years 2 and 3, respectively. A second, 4-6 years old plantation during the three-year survey period was found to be severely infested (average 92 +/- 1 %) with virtually no additional infestation over time. Estimated losses to borer infestation were calculated at 4,24,27 and 36 % in plantations that were 1-4 years old, respectively. Significantly more eggs were laid on leaves (66 +/- 4 %) compared to woody tissue, stems and twigs. Most eggs hatched between 02:00 and 04:00, with neonates migrating down to the stem base and entering the root just below the soil surface. A control strategy, exploiting aspects of neonate migratory and feeding behaviour, should result in both yield increases and prolonged survival of plantations beyond the typical 4-5-year cycle.

TI  - Susceptibility of Oriental Fruit Moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Larvae to Selected Reduced-Risk Insecticides
AB  - To determine their baseline susceptibility to chlorantraniliprole, spinetoram, spinosad, and acetamiprid, oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), neonates were placed on diet cubes containing a range of concentrations of each insecticide. Mortality was assessed after 96 h. Two populations-a long-term laboratory colony from Rutgers University and a colony established in 2007 from a southwestern Illinois (Calhoun County) field population-were tested. We used probit and logit analyses to compare the responses of Calhoun colony neonates from parents reared on 'Gala' apples (Mains spp.) with those of Calhoun colony neonates from parents reared on lima bean, Phaseolus lunatus L., diet. We also compared the responses of Calhoun colony neonates with those of Rutgers colony neonates (all from parents reared on apples). LC(50)s (ppm in diet) for Calhoun colony progeny of adults reared on apples were 0.08, 0.06, 0.41, and 0.30, respectively, for chlorantraniliprole, spinetoram, acetamiprid, and spinosad. Parental food source (apples versus lima bean diet) did not consistently influence the concentration-mortality relationships for neonates. Based on LC(50)s and toxicity ratio tests, Calhoun colony neonates were slightly but significantly less susceptible to spinetoram and acetamiprid than were Rutgers colony neonates. Similarly, LC(90)s and toxicity ratio tests indicated that Calhoun colony neonates were slightly but significantly less susceptible to chlorantraniliprole as well. However, toxicity ratios (Calhoun/Rutgers) were low in all instances, and the highest ratio was 1.73 at LC90 for chlorantraniliprole. Overall, the two colonies responded similarly to these insecticides. Results reported here provide baseline data for future monitoring of resistance development.

TI  - Impacts of weather, shade cover and elevation on coffee leafminer Leucoptera coffeella (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) population dynamics and natural enemies
AB  - We assessed the influences of ambient temperature, rainfall, shade cover and elevation on seasonal abundance of coffee leafminer Leucoptera coffeella (Guerin-Meneville) and its natural enemies in coffee farms in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico. Mined coffee leaves were most abundant during the rainy season (i.e. historical average rainfall >200 mm/mo, April-November) compared to the dry season (<100 mm/mo, December-March), and at low (<600 m asl) relative to high (>900 m asl) elevations. The abundance of mined leaves increased with rainfall, and decreased with maximum daily temperatures. Coffee leafminer survivorship was highest during the dry season (>40%), when predation was lowest (<10%). Predation was the main source of coffee leafminer mortality, and was greatest during the rainy season (>25%) when coffee leafminer incidence was highest (>30% mined leaves per plant). None of the weather variables that were evaluated (viz, maximum and minimum temperatures, and rainfall) significantly impacted parasitism ratios. Shade cover moderated on-farm temperatures, by reducing maximum daily temperatures and any potential, direct impacts of rainfall on coffee leafminer, by providing partial shelter from rainfall, but did not significantly affect coffee leafminer incidence. In 48 h laboratory trials, coffee leafminer oviposition was highest at 28 degrees C (similar to 15 eggs/female), minimal at 25 degrees C (similar to 3 eggs) and nil at 20 degrees C, and higher during night-time hours (>8 eggs/female/day) compared to daytime hours (<1 egg). Historical average temperatures were higher at low elevation (yearly average ca. 25 degrees C; range = 18.0-32.0 degrees C) than at high elevation (ca. 21 degrees C; 13.5-28.5 degrees C), and we predicted that physical environmental conditions (i.e. night-time hours with temperatures >20 degrees C) were permissive of coffee leafminer oviposition during twice as many hours each year at low elevation (4060 h) compared to high elevation (2081 h). Overall, our results suggested that evident differences in the abundance of coffee leafminer between elevations may be due in considerable part to differences in ambient temperatures, particularly night-time temperatures, rather than rainfall, shade cover, or elevation per se.

TI  - DIVERSITY OF MOTHS (LEPIDOPTERA: HETEROCERA) IN THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE BEDNJA RIVER, VARAZDIN COUNTY, NORTHERN CROATIA
AB  - The first survey of the moth fauna on the Natura 2000 site Livade uz Bednju I to IV and its near surroundings was conducted in 2016. Four locations were selected and visited three times in different seasons. A total of 381 moth species were recorded, with the most numerous families being Geometridae (102 species), Noctuidae (94 species), Erebidae (44 species) and Crambidae (35 species). In order to put the results in perspective, a preliminary checklist of moths in the Varazdin county was created based on the literature overview and this survey, containing 603 species. 189 species recorded during this survey represent new county records. The greatest increase in the number of species was for the Noctuidae (40 species) and Geometridae (19 species) families. Some species like Diachrysia zosimi were previously recorded only a few times in Croatia. The surveyed sites can now be regarded as some of the best studied areas in Croatia in respect to their moth fauna.

TI  - Plant-insect interactions patterns in three European paleoforests of the late-Neogene-early-Quaternary
AB  - Plants and insects are constantly interacting in complex ways through forest communities since hundreds of millions of years. Those interactions are often related to variations in the climate. Climate change, due to human activities, may have disturbed these relationships in modern ecosystems. Fossil leaf assemblages are thus good opportunities to survey responses of plant-insect interactions to climate variations over the time. The goal of this study is to discuss the possible causes of the differences of plant-insect interactions' patterns in European paleoforests from the Neogene-Quaternary transition. This was accomplished through three fossil leaf assemblages: Willershausen, Berga (both from the late Neogene of Germany) and Bernasso (from the early Quaternary of France). In Willershausen it has been measured that half of the leaves presented insect interactions, 35% of the fossil leaves were impacted by insects in Bernasso and only 25% in Berga. The largest proportion of these interactions in Bernasso were categorized as specialist (mainly due to galling) while in Willershausen and Berga those ones were significantly more generalist. Contrary to previous studies, this study did not support the hypothesis that the mean annual precipitation and temperature were the main factors that impacted the different plant-insect interactions' patterns. However, for the first time, our results tend to support that the hydric seasonality and the mean temperature of the coolest months could be potential factors influencing fossil plant-insect interactions.

TI  - Targeting Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) adults with low-volume applications of insecticides alone and in combination with sex pheromone
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies surveyed the toxicity of several insecticides against adult codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), and examined the field effectiveness of applying low-volume (12 L ha(-1)) sprays alone or in combination with a microencapsulated (MEC) sex pheromone formulation.RESULTS: Neonicotinyls, organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids significantly reduced fecundity at concentrations nearly 100-fold lower than their maximum labeled field rate. Field studies in 2005 demonstrated that six applications of esfenvalerate resulted in >90% reduction in fruit injury versus the untreated check. The addition of the MEC pheromone formulation did not further improve control. Five sprays of esfenvalerate, phosmet and acetamiprid all significantly reduced levels of fruit injury compared with the untreated control in 2006. Esfenvalerate and acetamiprid mixed with the MEC pheromone significantly reduced fruit injury compared with the MEC-only treatment. Significant increases in pest and decreases in predator mite densities occurred in plots treated with esfenvalerate in both years. Low-volume sprays of phosmet and acetamiprid did not disrupt mites.CONCLUSION: Low-volume insecticide sprays can effectively manage codling moth and are less disruptive of integrated mite management. Developing an effective 'attract and kill' technology with this approach will require optimization of the attractant(s) to maximize moth exposure to insecticide residues.

TI  - Impacts of invasive parasitoids on declining endemic Hawaiian leafroller moths (Omiodes: Crambidae) vary among sites and species
AB  - P>1. Invasive parasitoids and predators, both accidentally and purposefully introduced, have variously altered native insect communities worldwide, sometimes causing major declines and extinctions. Most species of endemic Hawaiian leafroller moth in the genus Omiodes (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) have suffered range reductions and local extirpations and some species appear to be extinct. Non-native parasitoids, particularly those introduced for biological control, have been implicated in declines of non-target Omiodes and other Hawaiian Lepidoptera.2. We assessed parasitism rates on Omiodes through controlled exposure trials using Omiodes continuatalis, a species once thought to be extinct due to non-native parasitoids. A total of 2514 O. continuatalis larvae were used in exposure trials on the islands of Maui and Oahu in 2006 and 2007. We also conducted extensive surveys for wild larvae of two target and three non-target Omiodes species, the latter also of conservation concern. Over 4 years, we collected 500 wild larvae across four islands to assess parasitoid impacts and compare results between wild larval collections and controlled exposure.3. Exposure trials estimated parasitism rates of O. continuatalis from 15 center dot 6% to 65 center dot 3% and field surveys indicated observed parasitism of 8 center dot 1-100%, depending upon the species and locality. Accidentally introduced or cryptogenic (of unknown origin) parasitoids were responsible for 85 center dot 7% of parasitism in deployed Omiodes larvae and 56 center dot 6% of observed parasitism in wild Omiodes larvae surveyed in 2007.4. The variation in these data appears to be associated with habitat level characteristics, which, in combination with species-specific features, may mediate the impacts of non-native parasitoids on Omiodes species.5. Synthesis and applications. Biological control agents may not be a primary cause of decline or extinction for some native moths. Successful conservation planning for threatened and declining insects will benefit from consideration of the synergistic effects of parasitoids and habitat on a species by species basis.

TI  - Diversity and composition of Amazonian moths in primary, secondary and plantation forests
AB  - The response of tropical fauna to landscape-level habitat change is poorly understood. Increased conversion of native primary forest to alternative land-uses, including secondary forest and exotic tree plantations, highlights the importance of assessing diversity patterns within these forest types. We sampled 1848 moths from 3 35 species of Arctiidae, Saturniidae and Sphingidae, over a total of 30 trap-nights. Sampling was conducted during the wet season 2005, using three light-traps at 15 sites within areas of primary forest, secondary forest and Eucalyptus urograndis plantations in northern Brazilian Amazonia. The Jari study region provides one of the best opportunities to investigate the ecological consequences of land-use change, and this study is one of the first to example patterns of diversity for it neotropical moth assemblage in a human-dominated landscape in lowland Amazonia. We found that the three moth families responded consistently to disturbance in terms of abundance and community structure but variably in terms of species richness, in a manner apparently supporting a life-history hypothesis. Our results suggest that secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations call support it substantial level of moth diversity but also show that these forest types hold assemblages with significantly community structures and composition from primary forest. In addition, the ability of these converted land-uses to support primary forest species may be enhanced by proximity to surrounding primary forest, an issue which requires consideration when assessing the diversity and composition of mobile taxa in human-dominated landscapes.

TI  - Plant Host Effect on the Development of Heliothis virescens F. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
AB  - Heliothis viresceas F. is an important polyphagous pest that can develop on > 100 plant species, including 20 economic crops. Populations of this insect are believed to be locally maintained on a few crops and weed hosts in Washington County, MS. To find the intrinsic value of these plants for the development of H. virescens populations, we fed different laboratory and wild colonies with fresh and lyophilized plant tissue under a constant temperature. Development time of this insect under laboratory conditions varied up to 10 d between plant hosts and was dependent on the type of plant tissue provided: fresh or lyophilized. Life table parameters such as net reproductive rate, finite rate of increase, and generation time indicated that Trifolium repens, a wild host growing around agricultural fields year round, could be one of the most suitable local plant hosts for the development of H. virescens. Two species of Geranium, previously reported as the source of the first H. virescens generation in the region, had lower intrinsic value as a food source than did T. repens. Gossyipium hirsutum, perhaps the most important crop source of H. virescens in the region, produced low net reproductive rate and finite rate of increase parameters. Sampling conducted in agricultural fields during 2006 and 2007 found no larvae on the above mentioned wild hosts as it was previously reported. Results indicated that H. virescens populations in this region were not supported by the wild plant species growing around agricultural fields during the time when the survey took place.

TI  - Evidence for field evolved resistance to newer insecticides in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) from Pakistan
AB  - The toxicity of representative newer insecticides, which are being used widely in Pakistan, were investigated against various populations of Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) collected from three different districts for 3 consecutive years. For spinosad, resistance ratio compared with Lab-PK were in the range of 7-122-fold, 3-95-fold for indoxacarb, 4-186-fold for abamectin, 2-77-fold for emamectin and 13-224-fold for fipronil. The resistance ratio for insect growth regulator (IGR) tested was in the range of 2-66-fold for leufenuron, 8-56-fold for diflubenuron and 2-153-fold for methoxyfenozide. Paired wise comparisons of the log LC(50)s of insecticides tested for all the populations showed correlations among several insecticides, suggesting a cross-resistance mechanism. The most probable reason for low toxicity of these insecticides could also be the development of multiple resistance mechanisms; however, further studies are required to establish these mechanisms. When these same products were tested against a susceptible laboratory population (Lab-PK), emamectin and indoxacarb were significantly more toxic than other compounds tested. The results are discussed in relation to integrated pest management (IPM) for the S. litura with respect to unstable resistance in the field. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Elements of population dynamics of bagworm (Lepidoptera : Psychidae) on hedge rows of white pine
AB  - Spatiotemporal elements related to the population dynamics of bagworms. Tyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Haworth) (Lepidoptera: Psychidae), on white pine, Pinus strobus (L). were investigated by sampling populations of bagworms repeatedly at 12 sites within a 50-km radius ill central Indiana. The number of live bagworms declined over time by upto 95% in some sites, and the rate of population decline increased with the initial density of larvae. A comparison Of population density of bagworms ill past generations with that of the current-year generation revealed that sites heavily infested with bagworms from previous years carried a high number of live larvae early but not late ill the season. The positive relationship between densities of bagworms in past and current generations Observed at five of 122 sites suggests that larvae commonly do not disperse, when they emerge on a suitable host. However. there was considerable variation relative to this pattern, suggesting that dispersal is common as well. Pupation and emergence of adults occurred in late summer and early fall, with some level of phenological asynchrony observed at different sites. Dates corresponding to 50% pupation or adult emergence varied by upto 12 d at different sites. Males suffered higher mortality than females during the pupal stage. The positive correlation between the mortality level of female pupae and previous years population density may be related to a buildup of populations of natural enemies in sites that were previously heavily infested with bagworms.

TI  - Field evaluations of concentrated spray applications of microencapsulated sex pheromone for codling moth (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae)
AB  - The application of a microencapsulated (MEC) sex pheromone formulation (Checkmate CM-F) for codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), in low Volume, concentrated sprays was evaluated in a series of small plot and grower trials in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen, and pear, Pyrus communis L. Preliminary tests found that MEC sprays applied at 172-207 kilopascals in 12-23 liters/ha deposited the highest density of microcapsules per leaf. The addition of a latex sicker did not increase the deposition of microcapsules. Small plot tests in 2004 compared the effectiveness of two low-volume sprayers against a standard high-volume spray (926 liters/ha) applied at 1,379 kilopascals. Moth catches and fruit injury were significantly lower in plots treated with the low-volume sprays compared with plots treated with the standard sprayer. These results suggest that concentrating the MEC formulation increases the deposition of microcapsules and improves its effectiveness. Larger trials were conducted with a low-volume sprayer in 4-ha plots within commercial apple (2005-2006) and pear orchards (2005) paired with similar plots treated with hand-applied pheromone dispensers. Levels of fruit injury were not significantly different between pheromone treatments in ally of the three tests. Moth catches, however, were significantly higher in the MEC-versus the dispenser-treated apple plots in 2005. No difference was found in the fruit injury levels in MEC-treated apple orchards in 2005 caused by irrigation method, but moth catches were significantly higher in overhead Versus undertree orchards. The advantages and current limitations of using MEC sex pheromone sprays to supplement current grower's management strategies for codling moth is discussed.

TI  - Inventory of the Nolidae, Erebidae, and Noctuidae (Insecta: Lepidoptera) of Plummers Island, Maryland
AB  - From 1902-2005 six species of Nolidae, 88 species of Erebidae, and 118 species of Noctuidae have been recorded from Plummers Island, Montgomery County, Maryland. Extensive collecting conducted from 19982005 resulted in five species of Nolidae, 70 species of Erebidae, and 88 species of Noctuidae. Only the Nolidae had sufficient specimens collected from 1902-1930 to compare with collections taken from 1998-2005. Five species were present from 1902-1930, and five from 1998-2005 with no change in species richness. A 20% species turnover was noted, with one extinction and one colonization. Owing to probable under-sampling from 1902-1930, the Erebidae and Noctuidae show a 37% and a 32% increase, respectively. This is contrary to other studies at Plummers Island, which showed a decrease in species richness. Species accumulation curves were based only on material collected from 1998-2005. Both abundance and incidence-based estimators were used to predict six species of Nolidae, 79-102 species of Erebidae, and 101-135 species of Noctuidae. Of the total of 212 species for all three families, 75.9% of the species were represented by 10 or fewer specimens. A checklist of the Nolidae, Erebidae, and Noctuidae, and their monthly abundances from 1902-2005 is provided.

TI  - Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton population fluctuation in Citrus deliciosa and Murcott hybrid Citrus sinensis x Citrus reticulata
AB  - To evaluate the population dynamics of Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), the citrus leafminer, in tangerine Citrus deliciosa Tenore var. Montenegrina and tangor 'Murcott' Citrus sinensis L Osbeck X Citrus reticulata Blanco in organically managed orchards, in Montenegro (29 degrees 68'S e 51 degrees 46'W), RS, fortnightly samples were carried out from July 2001 to June 2003. Sampled shoots were examined in the lab and the number (if leaves, presence or absence of mines and the number of mines, eggs, larvae and pupae were recorded. In both orchards there were no records of P. citrella mines in the first leaf flush, from August to October. In the first year, the highest mine densities were recorded in the middle of November, beginning of January and in April for both orchards. In the following year, the highest mine and larval densities were in January and April for C. deliciosa var Montenegrina and from December to March for 'Murcott'. Although the number of shoots has always been greater in C. deliciosa, the citrus leafminer colonization and establishment followed the same pattern for both orchards. Minimum and medium temperature and relative humidity were the abiotic factors showing the strongest influence in the numbers of P. citrella mines and larvae.

TI  - The effects of local selection versus dispersal on insecticide resistance patterns: longitudinal evidence from diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera : Plutellidae)) in Australia evolving resistance to pyrethroids
AB  - When strong directional selection acts on a trait, the spatial distribution of phenotypes may reflect effects of selection, as well as the spread of favoured genotypes by gene flow. Here we investigate the relative impact of these factors by assessing resistance to synthetic pyrethroids in a 12-year study of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, from southern Australia. We estimated resistance levels in populations from brassicaceous weeds, canola, forage crops and vegetables. Differences in resistance among local Populations sampled repeatedly were stable over several years. Levels were lowest in samples from weeds and highest in vegetables. Resistance in canola samples increased over time as insecticide use increased. There was no evidence that selection in one area influenced resistance in adjacent areas. Microsatellite variation from 13 Populations showed a low level of genetic variation among Populations, with an AMOVA indicating that population only accounted for 0.25% of the molecular variation. This compared to an estimate of 13.8% of variation accounted for by the resistance trait. Results suggest that local selection rather than gene flow of resistance alleles dictated variation in resistance across populations. Therefore, regional resistance management strategies may not limit resistance evolution.

TI  - Phenological patterns of Spodoptera Guen,e, 1852 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is more affected by ENSO than seasonal factors and host plant availability in a Brazilian Savanna
AB  - The identification of factors responsible for the population dynamics is fundamental for pest management, since losses can reach 18% of annual production. Besides regular seasonal environmental factors and crop managements, additional supra-annual meteorological phenomena can also affect population dynamics, although its relevance has been rarely investigated. Among crop pests, Spodoptera stands out due to its worldwide distribution, high degree of polyphagy, thus causing damages in several crops in the world. Aiming to distinguish the relevance of different factors shaping population dynamics of Spodoptera in an ecosystem constituted of dry and rainy seasons, the current study used circular statistics to identify phenological patterns and test if its population fluctuation is driven by El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect, seasonal meteorological parameters, and/or host plant availability. Samplings were done in an intercropping system, in the Brazilian Savanna, during the new moon cycles between July/2013 and June/2016. Species were recorded all year round, but demonstrated differently non-uniform distribution, being concentrated in different seasons of the year. Population fluctuations were mostly affected by the ENSO intensity, despite the contrasting seasonal meteorological variation or host plant availability in a 400-m radius. Studies involving the observation of supra-annual phenomena, although rare, reach similar conclusions in relation to Neotropical insect fauna. Therefore, it is paramount to have long-term sampling studies to obtain a more precise response of the pest populations towards the agroecosystem conditions.

TI  - Interaction of a newly established immigrant, soybean looper Thysanoplusia orichalcea and the indigenous green looper Chrysodeixis eriosoma (Plusiinae : Noctuidae) in New Zealand
AB  - Soybean looper Thysanoplusia orichalcea (Plusiinae: Noctuidae) moths were first intercepted in New Zealand in 1984 by light trapping that was being used as a surveillance tool for new lepidopteran pests; in particular, noctuid species from Australia. This prompted studies on larval infestations to separate the impact of T. orichalcea caterpillars from that of the closely related indigenous green looper, Chrysodeixis eriosoma. Subsequent studies described here show that the establishment phase took place over c. 3 years and that, rather than replacing the resident green looper, soybean looper added to the population density of plusiine caterpillars in several field crops, especially lucerne, parsley, soybeans, brassicas, and lettuce. The increases in larval populations caused by T. orichalcea in soybeans were documented from 1980 to 1989, with total plusiine populations reaching c. 46/m of row compared with c. 10/m of row for C. eriosoma. Light trap catches of moths confirmed the increasing abundance of T. orichalcea. By 1990 it represented 87% of the plusiine moths trapped at Pukekohe. This case history supports the use of light traps as a surveillance tool to provide biosecurity warnings and to initiate establishment and impact surveys for incursions of new noctuid pests.

TI  - Ecology of diamondback moth in Australian canola: landscape perspectives and the implications for management
AB  - The ecology of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylsotella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), and records of its frequent, but sporadic, population outbreaks in the canola agroecosystems of southern and western Australia are reviewed. The migratory capacity of DBM, possible maintenance of pest populations on brassicaceous weeds and forage crops, resistance to commonly used pyrethroid insecticides, a lack of effective natural enemies ( due to disruption by insecticides and difficulties associated with colonising the vast areas of canola crops) and suitable climatic conditions during critical phases of the crop cycle are all likely to contribute to the observed pest outbreaks. A greater understanding of the ecology of DBM in the canola landscape is fundamental to improving its management in the crop but relevant long-term DBM abundance data are currently lacking. Five critical research issues are identified: (i) improved understanding of the factors which determine regional movement patterns of diamondback in canola-growing areas; (ii) the development and implementation of flexible insecticide resistance management strategies; (iii) better understanding of canola crop colonisation by natural enemies of DBM and their population dynamics under current and alternative insecticide application strategies; (iv) greater appreciation of the interactions between DBM and its crop and weedy host plants; and (v) the development of validated simulation models to aid in the forecasting of possible DBM outbreaks. Each issue represents a significant challenge but all must be addressed if the development of a sustainable integrated strategy for the management of DBM in Australian canola is to become a reality.

TI  - Temperature-related fitness costs of resistance to spinosad in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera : Plutelidae)
AB  - Fitness costs associated with resistance genes expressed in the absence of insecticides affect the evolution of insecticide resistance and the outcome of resistance management programmes. However, measurements of fitness costs may not be straightforward as they vary with environmental conditions. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), has developed resistance to spinosad, the first insecticide of the Naturalyte class, after only a few years of field application of this product. In this study, we compared the performance of two homogenous strains of P. xylostella, one susceptible (SS) and the other resistant (RR) to spinosad at an unfavourable, low natural temperature regime, a favourable median-fluctuating temperature regime and an unfavourable high-fluctuating temperature regime. The RR strain showed only marginal fitness cost at the median temperature regime. At the low temperature regime, the RR strain failed to produce any viable offspring, while the SS strain achieved positive population growth. At the high temperature regime, the RR strain showed a 33% decrease in intrinsic rate of increase compared to the SS strain. The results demonstrate that fitness costs of resistance to spinosad are temperature-dependent, increasing in scale at unfavourably low and high temperatures; costs were particularly high at low temperatures. Suggestions for designing effective management programmes are made to delay or avoid development of resistance to spinosad by P. xylostella under different temperature conditions.

TI  - Densities of Heliothis virescens and Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) in three plant hosts
AB  - Large numbers of field-collected tobacco budworms Heliothis virescens L., and/or bollworms Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (heliothines) might be difficult to obtain depending upon host plants available to the insects. Of the >95 cultivated and wild plants that have been identified as their hosts, some are highly attractive to these insects, some are also widely available and of those, some could be used to collect large numbers of both insect species. However, the reliability of these plants in space and time in providing abundant samples of larvae and/or moths is not well understood. We studied naturally-occurring heliothine populations over a 3-year period in 2 different geographic locations in plots of garbanzo bean (Cicer arietinum L.), upland cotton (Gossipium hirsutum L.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medikus) finding that garbanzo bean produced significantly higher numbers of tobacco budworm and bollworm larvae and adults as compared to the other 2 plant species. Tobacco budworm larvae were found in at least 1 host plant (primarily garbanzo) all the years in both locations while bollworm larvae were not. Field moth emergence represented <= 10% of its larval densities and abiotic factors made a difference on moth emergence between years. When large numbers of both insects are needed for field or laboratory studies, garbanzo bean offers a clear advantage over cotton or velvetleaf to obtain collections of heliothines.

TI  - Adult feeding increases fecundity in female Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae)
AB  - The availability and quality of nectar for adults are thought to affect fecundity of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of adult feeding on the fecundity, and oviposition pattern of moths, and larval performance (egg hatch). The moths were fed either on distilled water, honey solution, or one of a range of concentrations of sucrose solution. The results showed that diets with sugars significantly increased fecundity and adult lifespan. Lifespan, total numbers of eggs and egg mass were significantly higher for females that fed on sugar during adult life. Egg hatch (a measure of offspring fitness) decreased over time regardless of sucrose concentration, but had always higher levels in the groups fed sugars. The peak of the ovipositing period was delayed and prolonged, with more eggs deposited, when moths were fed on sugar solution. In conclusion, adult feeding increases the fecundity of female moths and plays an important role in enhancing the fitness of individual cotton bollworm offspring.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny and dating of an insular endemic moth radiation inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear genes: The genus Galagete (Lepidoptera : Autostichidae) of the Galapagos Islands
AB  - Galagete is a genus of microlepidoptera including 12 nominate species endemic to the Galapagos Islands. In order to better understand the diversification of this endemic insular radiation, to unravel relationships among species and populations, and to get insight into the early stages of speciation, we developed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on the combined mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (555 bp) and II (453 bp), and the nuclear elongation factor-1 alpha (711 bp) and wingless (351 bp) genes. Monophyly of the genus is strongly supported in the Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses suggesting a single colonization event by a common ancestor. Two cases of paraphyly observed between species are hypothesized to represent imperfect species limits for G. espanolaensis nested within the G. turritella clade, and introgressive hybridization or lineage sorting in the case of the population of G. protozona from Santa Fe nested within the G. gnathodoxa clade. A geologically calibrated, relaxed molecular clock model was used for the first time to unravel the chronological sequence of an insular radiation. The first split occurring within the Galagete lineage on the archipelago is estimated at 3.3 +/- 0.4 million years ago. The genus radiated relatively quickly in about 1.8 million years, and gives an estimated speciation rate of 0.8 species per million years. Although the colonization scenario shows a stochastic dispersal pattern, the arrival of the ancestor and the diversification of the radiation coincide with the chronological emergence of the major islands.

TI  - Selection of non-target Lepidoptera species for ecological risk assessment of Bt maize in South Africa
AB  - It is essential to assess the environmental risk that Bt maize may hold and to study its effect on species assemblages that fulfil a variety of ecosystem functions. Environmental risk assessment can be improved through the use of an ecological model which can be applied to a specific environment, so that local species can be classified functionally and prioritized to identify potential test species. Although the stem borers, Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), are the target species of Bt maize in South Africa various other Lepidoptera species are also directly exposed to Bt toxin. In this paper an ecological approach was followed for selection of non-target Lepidoptera species for ecological risk assessment of Bt maize, using data collected over a two-year period on Lepidoptera biodiversity on maize. Nine primary non-target lepidopterous consumers were identified. A selection matrix was developed in which each species was ranked for its maximum potential exposure to Bt toxin by assessing its occurrence, abundance, presence and linkage to other host plants in the maize ecosystem. Non-target Lepidoptera most likely to be affected were identified and prioritized for future testing and inclusion in risk assessments. Several non-target species were prioritized for their close association with maize, general occurrence in the maize-growing regions and their potential for economic damage should they become secondary pests. Through use of the selection matrix, knowledge gaps were identified for future research and guidance for the design of ecologically realistic experiments. Non-target species populations with the highest maximum potential exposure to Bt toxin are Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Acantholeucania loreyi (Duponchel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Eublemma gayneri (Rothschild) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) can be considered to be a 'value unknown' species in the wild. Because of their sporadic occurrence, Agrotis segetum (Denis & Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) are considered to be of lesser importance than H. armigera and A. loreyi, but should also be considered during pre- and post-release monitoring.

TI  - Genetic variation among Mediterranean populations of Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) as revealed by RFLP mtDNA analysis
AB  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of two segments of mitochondrial DNA (COI and 16S rRNA) was used to examine genetic variation in Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) populations from the Mediterranean basin. Four populations were collected from central and southern Greece, and five from northern latitudes: Greece, Italy, France and Spain. No variation was observed in COI, while 16S rRNA segment proved highly polymorphic and 28 different haplotypes were found. Lower intra-population polymorphism was found in the northern populations than in southern ones. Although no significant isolation by distance was found, the UPGMA tree based on Nei's raw number of nucleotide differences separated the populations into two major groups, i.e. one with the northern (40.6 degrees N-43.4 degrees N) and the other with the southern populations (37.3 degrees N-39.2 degrees N). Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the variation was between the two major groups (phi(CT)=0.559), and all pairwise comparisons between the northern and southern populations resulted in high and significant F-ST values (overall F-ST = 0.604). The high F-ST values and the strong spatial genetic structure indicate that long-distance migration may be a rare event. The populations do not seem to have experienced a strong historical bottleneck. The occurrence of a few widespread haplotypes and the genetic similarity of the northern populations could be attributed to a historical expansion of certain haplotypes from the south towards to the northern borders of the species' distribution area.

TI  - Caterpillar (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) feeding on pasture grasses in central Florida
AB  - Stargrasses (Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst var. nlemfuensis) and bermudagrasses (C dactylon (L.) Persoon) are important warm-season forage grasses, with several cultivars developed for conditions found in central and southern Florida. Major insect pests of these grasses include grass loopers (Mocis spp.) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)), which annually may impose economic losses for beef cattle and hay producers. Population studies conducted during a 3-year period showed that both species had similar profiles with respect to larval population seasonality but not abundance. Plot studies with 4 stargrass and 4 bermudagrass lines showed that higher grass looper populations were found in stargrasses than bermudagrasses. Laboratory studies found grass loopers and fall armyworm larvae generally developed faster with larger weights on lines of stargrass than lines of bermudagrass. The two fall armyworm host strains also can differ substantially in their larval weight, developmental time, and survivability when grown on different lines of grasses. These results indicate that the selection of pasture grasses made by growers can significantly and differentially affect the population densities of these grass defoliators.

TI  - Evaluation of long-term mating disruption of Ephestia kuehniella and Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae) in indoor storage facilities by pheromone traps and monitoring of relative aerial concentrations of pheromone
AB  - The potential for pheromone-based mating disruption (MD) of Ephestia kuehniella (Walker) and Plodia interpuninctella (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was investigated in two flour mills and a pet food distributor. Plastic sachets emitting 2-3 mg per d (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate, the major pheromone component of both moth species, were used as MD dispensers, which were applied in grid systems resulting in one dispenser per 100 m(3) of air volume. Pheromone traps with sticky inserts were used to monitor moth population fluctuations. To monitor pheromone levels in the air before, during, and after the treatment, electroantennographic (EAG) measurements were performed using a portable device. All localities showed decreased trap catches after application of MD. In two localities with low initial population densities, trap catches were reduced immediately after application of MD and remained very low, even several months after the MD treatment was terminated. In contrast, in a locality with a higher initial population density the reduction in trap catches was slower, and trap catches increased again soon after the termination of the MD, treatment. Electrophysiological data showed not only increased aerial levels of pheromone during the treatment period but also levels that were higher than during pretreatment, even 12 mo after removal of MD dispensers. The localities had good ventilation, and the memory effect observed indicates that the pheromone adhered to surfaces that subsequently functioned as secondary dispensers. Customer complaints registered by one of the mills were 49% less in 2004, after 2 yr of MD compared with 2002, the year before the treatments began.

TI  - The ecology of Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) in the Riverina region of south-eastern Australia and the implications for tactical and strategic management
AB  - Decisions on the choice of appropriate tactical and strategic control techniques require an understanding of the seasonal distribution and ecology of the target species. To address this need, data were collected from 1997 to 2000 using crop surveys, field sampling and pheromone trapping to monitor the population trends of Helicoverpa armigera (HUbner) and H. punctigera (Wallengren) in the Riverina region of south-eastern Australia. The data gathered are compared to predictions from the HElicoverpa Armigera and Punctigera Simulation (HEAPS) model, that simulates Helicoverpa population dynamics to assist in identifying the drivers of regional populations and provide a framework to make informed decisions. The results highlight the contrasting seasonal dynamics of H. punctigera and H. armigera within the region. Helicoverpa punctigera populations peak in the spring, driven by large scale spring migration into the region and subsequently decline. Helicoverpa armigera populations, conversely, are characterized by a period of spring recruitment of adults from overwintering pupae within the region, followed by a within-season population increase leading to severe late season pressure. The within-season increase of H. armigera is a result of the succession of crop and non-crop hosts with the main driver being sequentially sown, unsprayed maize. Tactical and strategic management options are discussed in light of these findings.

TI  - Larch- and pine-feeding host races of the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana) have cyclic and synchronous population fluctuations
AB  - Population cycles of many forest-defoliating insects often show synchronous fluctuations at both intra-specific (spatial synchrony) and inter-specific levels. However, population dynamics of different host-associated biotypes of the same species, such as those of the larch budmoth (LBM), Zeiraphera diniana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), have never been compared. This species causes extensive defoliation of larch forests every 8 to 9 years in the Alps, but it consists of two genetically-differentiated host races, the first one developing on European larch, Larix decidua, and the other one developing on Swiss stone pine, Pinus cembra. The dynamics of Zeiraphera populations have been extensively studied on larch, whereas little is known about larval density and possible population fluctuations on sympatric pines. A larval census on Swiss stone pine was conducted in the Swiss Alps intermittently between 1958 to 2004 and in the French Alps from 1992 to 2004. Population density of Zeiraphera on pine varied up to 5000-fold and showed periodic oscillations, with five peaks in Switzerland and one in France. Because the feeding activity of the pine race is restricted to the elongating shoot of the current year, no conspicuous defoliation of pine trees was noted during years of high larval densities. Zeiraphera populations on pine oscillated in significant synchrony with larch-associated populations, and peak densities were observed either the same year or shifted by +/- one year. Our results did not allow any explanation for cyclic fluctuations of LBM on pine, but the synchrony with the larch race's cycle suggests that studies on genetics as well as on parasitism should be intensified.

TI  - Establishment and expansion of a Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Den. & Schiff.) (Lep. Notodontidae), population with a shifted life cycle in a production pine forest, Central-Coastal Portugal
AB  - In 1997, a temporally shifted population of Thaumetopoea pilyocampa (Den. & Schiff.), was recorded for the first time in a restricted area of the oldest National Pine Forest of Portugal-the National Pine Forest of Leiria. This new population larval development takes place during the summer (summer population-SP), while in the normal population it takes place during the winter (winter population-WP). Between 2000 and 2003, we assessed the distribution and expansion of the SP, and quantified the differences in population densities, mortality and major life history traits with the WP within the Leiria Forest. The SP occurred at higher population levels (5-35% attacked trees) in a large continuous area of young plantations with high tree density, the same area where it was initially discovered. These densities were higher than the ones recorded for the WP in any part of the forest (0-12%), although both populations coexist geographically. The temporally shifted population preferably attacked young plantations. It also expanded south, following the direction of the dominant winds during adult flight. SP had a lower fecundity than the WP, however it benefited from lower egg mortality due mostly to a low rate of parasitism. It also benefited from a lower mortality in the early larval instars leading to low levels of colony extinction. SP larvae take half the time compared to the WP larvae, to reach the same final mass, probably due to the fact that they develop under higher temperature and global radiation. Separated emergence timings of adults lead to an allochronic isolation of the two populations. However, if this might represent an allochronic speciation event has to await further ecological and evolutionary studies of the system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phylogeographic pattern and regional evolutionary history of the maize stalk borer Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) in sub-Saharan Africa
AB  - Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is one of the major cereal pests in sub-Saharan Africa. Previous phylogeographic investigations on samples collected in Kenya, Cameroon and West-Africa showed the presence of three main clades (W, KI, KII) originated from populations isolated in West and East Africa around one million years ago. Demographic and phylogenetic analyses suggested that this event was followed by local demographic expansion and isolation by distance. These hypotheses were tested by a more comprehensive sampling across B. fusca's geographic range in Africa. Comparisons of sequences of partial mitochondrial DNA gene (cytochrome b) from 489 individuals of 98 localities in southern, central, eastern and western African countries confirmed the presence of the three main clades. Phylogenetic, F-statistics, demographic parameters and nested clade phylogeographic analyses confirmed that the clades experienced geographic and demographic expansion with isolation by distance after their isolation in three refuge areas. The geographic range of clade KII, already known from East to Central sub-Saharan Africa was extended to Southern Africa. Mismatch distribution analysis and the negative values of Tajima's D index are consistent with a demographic expansion hypothesis for these three clades. Significant genetic differentiations were revealed at various hierarchical levels by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Hypotheses about the geographic origin of the three main clades are detailed.

AB  - Field trials were conducted at Kibaha and Morogoro in eastern Tanzania during two seasons to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization (0, 50, 75, 100 kg [N]/ha) on pest abundance, plant damage and yield loss of maize due to stemborers. In general, ear and grain weights increased linearly with nitrogen level. In the infested plot, grain weight increased 2.5 and 1.8 fold from 0 to 100 kg [N]/ha in the short and long rainy season, respectively, at Kibaha, and 1.4 and 1.6 times at Morogoro. Yield loss decreased with an increase in nitrogen application and the effect was stronger under high than low borer infestation levels. The results show the beneficial effect of nitrogen on the plant's ability to compensate for borer damage. Analysis of economic benefits of applying fertilizer and insecticide treatment indicated that using insecticides is not profitable under high-pest-low-soil fertility conditions.

TI  - Mating disruption and attract and-kill as reduced-risk strategies for control of grape root borer Vitacea polistiformis (Lepidoptera : Sesiidae) in Florida vineyards
AB  - Mating disruption and attract-and-kill (A&K) gels were evaluated for control of grape root borer (GRB), Vitacea polistiformis Harris (Lepidoptera:sessidae), in Florida grape (Vitis sp.) vineyards. For mating disruption, pheromone twist-ties with leopard moth, Zeuzera pyrina L. (Lepidoptera: Cossidae), pheromone were placed in vines at a rate of 635 per ha. Attract-and-kill (A&K) gels containing the GRB pheromone and a pyrethrin (botanical insecticide) were applied to vine trunks at a rate of 112.5 g per hectare. These treatments were compared with chlorpyrifos (Lorsban), an organophosphate insecticide, and an untreated control in a randomized complete block design. Two wing-style sticky traps with GRB pheromone were placed in each treatment to monitor male moth activity and determine levels of trap shutdown. Complete trap shutdown occurred in the twist-tie sections for both 2003 and 2004 suggesting disruption of mating. Traps placed in the A&K and the pheromone twist-tie sections caught significantly fewer GRB than the Lorsban treatments in 2003. In 2004, significantly fewer moths were caught in the pheromone twist-tie and Lorsban treatments than the A&K and untreated controls. The differences between 2003 and 2004 for A&K treatments were due to the use of the incorrect pheromone blend in the 2004 batch of A&K. Whereas the differences in Lorsban treatments between both years may be related to residual activity of the pesticide. The economics of adopting A&K and mating disruption with twist-ties containing leopard moth pheromone is discussed. Both A&K and mating disruption with the leopard moth pheromone show promise as reduced-risk control tactics to be used in a GRB integrated pest management program and warrant further study.

TI  - Palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from biological remains in short lake sediment cores from the Central Alps and Dolomites
AB  - In this paper we review research on eutrophication, acidification and climate change based on studies of lake sediments in the Alps. Studies on fossil diatoms, chrysophytes, plant pigments, Cladocera and carbonaceous particles in a number of high altitude lakes in Italy and Switzerland have been used to track environmental changes. We present an original study on fossil Cladocera in sediment cores from 29 lakes that have shown changes in biodiversity from the pre-industrial period (ca. pre AD 1850) to the present. These data show that altitude, ca. 60 years of acidification impacts and fish stocking are the most important factors that affect their distribution and abundance. We review further case studies from two morphometrically and chemically different lakes (Tovel and Paione Superiore). Their lake sediment records span 400 and 150 years, respectively; multi-core, multi-proxy analyses show their pH, trophic and climatic evolution over time.

TI  - Analysis of historic western spruce budworm defoliation in south central British Columbia
AB  - The western spruce budworm Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) periodically defoliates interior Douglas-fir Pseudotsuga menziesii ((Mirb.) Franco) forests in British Columbia. Repeated budworm defoliation causes tree mortality, reduction in growth rates and reduced lumber quality. An overlay analysis using historic and recent annual aerial overview information was completed to describe population fluctuations of the western spruce budworm in the south central portion of British Columbia. The overlay analysis defined areas of chronic, intermittent and no budworm defoliation between 1916 and 2003 in potentially susceptible forest types. The majority of the defoliation records from south central BC during this time period occurred within the Kamloops Forest Region, where we identified five outbreak sub-regions that were geographically distinct. Stands within the Interior Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zone were most susceptible and suffered the greatest amount of chronic, sustained budworm activity. Over 45% of the Interior Douglas-fir zone had recorded defoliation, with some outbreaks lasting over 9 years. Within the Interior Douglas-fir zone, the dry, cool subzone and very dry, hot subzone were most prone to sustained outbreak events. The moister ecosystems, such as the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone, had over 30% of its area defoliated. However, these outbreaks were less frequent and rarely lasted more than 3 years.

TI  - Distribution, pest status and agro-dimatic preferences of lepidopteran stem borers of maize in Kenya
AB  - Lepidopterous stem borers are the main field insect pests that attack maize, Zea mays L. in tropical Africa. A survey was carried during the long and short rain cropping seasons of 2002/2003 across six main agro-climatic zones (ACZs) to determine the spatial distribution of important stem borer species in Kenya. A total of 474 visits were made in the seventy-eight localities conveniently chosen to represent each of the six ACZs. 189,600 stems were checked for infestation, of which 27,799 infested stems were destructively cut and dissected for stem borer larvae identification. An average of 1.4 stem borer larvae were recovered per infested plant. 54.5% of the recovered larvae were identified as Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Crambidae), 39.7% as Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Noctuidae), 4.5% as Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Noctuidae) and 0.8% as Chilo orichalcociliellus (Strand) (Crambidae). Minor species present included Eldana saccharina Walker (Pyralidae), Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) (Noctuidae), Sesamia cretica Lederer (Noctuidae), Sesamia sp. (Noctuidae), Sciomesa piscator Fletcher (Noctuidae), Busseola sp near phaia (Noctuidae), Chilo sp, Ematheudes sp 1 (Pyralidae) and Ematheudes sp 2 (Pyralidae). Farms were grouped into respective ACZs for statistical analysis and subsequent comparison of dominant species: Results indicated that B. fusca was the dominant stem borer species in high potential zones (highland tropics, moist transitional zone and moist mid-altitude) while the exotic C. partellus dominated smallholder farms in low potential zones (dry mid-altitude, dry transional and lowland tropical zone). Within each ACZs, there was evidence of variation in species proportions between seasons. These spatio-temporal differences in community structure are discussed in terms of agro-climatic biological adaptations.

TI  - Diel periodicity of emergence and premating reproductive behaviors of adult dogwood borer (Lepidoptera : Sesiidae)
AB  - The emergence and premating reproductive behaviors of adult dogwood borer moths, Synanthedon scitula Harris (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), were examined under controlled conditions in the laboratory and in apple orchards in Virginia. The diel periodicity of male response to pheromone sources was recorded using traps baited with commercial pheromone lures and with a recently identified, trinary blend of dogwood borer sex pheromone components. An earlier study reporting a significant effect of pheromone trap, height on the capture of male dogwood borer was revisited, using commercial lures and the new pheromone. Under a 16:8 (L:D)-h photo regimen, the emergence of male and female moths showed a diel periodicity, peaking at 0600 hours. Sexual receptivity of female moths, indicated by the onset of calling behavior, occurred in most individuals on the day after emergence and was observed only (luring the crepuscular period just before and after sunset. Similarly, the capture of male dogwood borer in traps deployed in July and baited)with Virgin female moths or pheromone lures coincided with the period of female calling behavior, peaking sharply between 2000 and 2100 hours. When pheromone-baited traps were deployed in September, the peak capture of male dogwood borer Occurred earlier, between 1900 and 2000 hours. Traps baited with a commercial lure captured significantly more male dogwood borer at 1.8 in (6 ft), whereas those baited with the trinary dog,wood borer sex pheromone captured similar numbers of males at elevations ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 in (4-8 ft). Use of the new dogwood borer sex pheromone has tremendously increased the precision of trapping data and has yielded reliable measurements of the behavior and abundance of male moths that pertain directly to improved monitoring and management capabilities.

TI  - Seasonal trend of flight activity of the pearl millet stemborer Coniesta ignefusalis (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae) as indicated by pheromone trap relationship with Samaru, catches and its weather factors at Nigeria
AB  - A water-oil based pheromone trap was used to monitor seasonal population changes of Coniesta ignefusalis Hampson in millet-based cropping systems at Samaru, Zaria, Nigeria for three consecutive seasons (1997, 1998 and 1999). Daily meteorological data were obtained from the Meteorological Unit of the Institute for Agricultural Research, Samaru, Zaria, for the monitoring period. Two population peaks were observed in early August and September in 1997 and 1998. The first population peak in August 1997 was earlier and bigger than the one in 1998. A delayed emergence of the insects was observed in 1999 when only one population peak occurred and this was smaller than those in 1997 and 1998. Using step-wise multiple regression analyses, the relationship between pheromone trap catches of male moths and weather factors was assessed separately for each year to determine which of the weather factors contributed most to the insect population changes. Solar radiation in the preceding 10 days and minimum air temperature in the preceding 40 and 50 days explained 84.9% of the variance in population changes and flight activity of male moths in 1997. Wind direction and speed in the preceding 20 and 60 days respectively accounted for 80.6% of the variance in 1998, while maximum air temperature and relative humidity in the preceding 40 and 20 days respectively explained 99.9% of the variance in 1999. The functional regression equations developed involving these weather factors adequately predicted the changes in each year.

TI  - Dispersion statistics and a sampling plan for Helicoverpa (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) on fresh-market tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum)
AB  - Helicoverpa spp. is the primary pest in the Australian fresh-market tomato industry. We describe the spatial distribution of Helicoverpa spp. eggs on fresh-market tomato crops in the Goulburn Valley region of Victoria, and present a sequential sampling plan for monitoring population densities. The distribution of Helicoverpa spp. eggs was highly contagious, as indicated by a Taylor's b-value of 1.59. This high level of contagion meant that relatively large sample sizes would need to be collected to obtain an estimate of population density. High-precision sampling plans generally necessitated impractical sample sizes, and thus the plan we present is a relatively low-precision level plan (SE/mean = 0.3). Nonetheless, this level of precision is considered adequate for most agronomic scenarios. The plan was validated using a statistical re-sampling approach. The level of precision achieved was generally close to the nominal level. Likewise, the number of samples collected generally showed little departure from the theoretically calculated minimum sample size.

TI  - Two European Cornus L. feeding leafmining moths, Antispila petryi Martini, 1899, sp rev. and A. treitschkiella (Fischer von Roslerstamm, 1843) (Lepidoptera, Heliozelidae): an unjustified synonymy and overlooked range expansion
AB  - Antispila treitschkiella (Fischer von Roslerstamm, 1843) and A. petryi Martini, 1899, sp. rev. were regarded as synonymous since 1978, but are shown to be two clearly separated species with different host-plants, life histories, DNA barcodes and morphology. Antispila treitschkiella feeds on Cornus mas L., is bivoltine, and has, by following its ornamentally planted host, greatly expanded its range in north-western Europe. In contrast A. petryi feeds on the widespread native C. sanguinea L., is univoltine, and is one of only two Antispila species previously resident in the British Isles, the Netherlands and northern Europe. Consequently, the increase in abundance of A. treitschkiella in the Netherlands since the early 1990s and in Great Britain in recent years must be regarded as part of a recent expansion into north-western Europe, whereas the native A. petryi is hardly expanding and less abundant. In Britain, detailed surveys of parks and living collections confirmed the monophagy of these two species. A search of British herbarium samples provided no evidence for an earlier date of establishment. Information on recognition of all stages, including DNA barcodes, and distribution is provided, and these two species are compared with the third European Cornus L. leafminer, A. metallella (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775).

TI  - Cloning of hsc70 and its expression in response to crowding in the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
AB  - [Objectives] High population density causes stress to insect populations. Mythimna separata has solitary and gregarious phases that occur at low and high population densities, respectively. This study aims to explore the role of hsc70 under crowding stress by comparing the expression profiles of hsc70 in the two phases of the M. separata. [Methods] The complete cDNA sequence of hsc70 was cloned by RT-PCR and RACE. Bioinformatics programs were used to analyze the sequence characteristics of the gene and its amino acid sequences. The expression levels of hsc70 in different developmental stages (egg, 1st-6th instar larva, pupa and adult) and tissues of 5th instar larvae (head, epidermis, fore-gut, mid-gut, hindgut and Malpighian tubules) from different phases (solitary and gregarious) were detected by Quantitative Real-time PCR(qRT-PCR). [Results] The complete cDNA of hsc70 obtained from M. separata (named as Mshsc70) was 2 184 bp in length (GenBank accession no.: MH669276), including a 1 965 bp opening reading frame (ORF) encoding 653 amino acids. Sequence analysis indicates that MsHSC70 has typical motifs of the HSP70 family, including IDLGTTYS (11-18 aa), IFDLGGGTFDVSLL (198-211 aa) and IVLVGGSTRIPKVQQ (341-355 aa). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that HSC70s from Noctuid moths could be assigned to one well-supported cluster. Mshsc70 was expressed in all developmental stages of both phases, its expression in 1st and 5th instar larvae of gregarious individuals was significantly up-regulated compared to solitary individuals, whereas its expression in 2nd and 3rd instar larvae was obviously down-regulated. The differential expression of hsc70 in different tissues was higher in gregarious than in solitary individuals, except in the epidermis and foregut. hsc70 transcripts were significantly up-regulated (3.17 times of that the control) in solitary M. separata larvae after these were kept in crowded conditions for 36 h, but transcript abundance did not change in gregarious larvae that were kept isolated for 36 h. [ Conclusion] Population density may be an important factor determining hsc70 expression in M. separata

TI  - Weather-dependent fluctuations in the abundance of the oak processionary moth, Thaumetopoea processionea (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae)
AB  - Population fluctuations of the well-known oak defoliator, the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea L.), were studied using light trap data and basic meteorological parameters (monthly average temperatures, and precipitation) at three locations in Western Hungary over a period of 15 years (1988-2012). The fluctuations in the numbers caught by the three traps were strongly synchronized. One possible explanation for this synchrony may be similar weather at the three trapping locations. Cyclic Reverse Moving Interval Techniques (CReMIT) were used to define the period of time in a year that most strongly influences the catches. For this period, we defined a species specific aridity index for Thaumetopoea processionea (THAU-index). This index explains 54.8-68.9% of the variation in the yearly catches, which indicates that aridity, particularly in the May-July period was the major determinant of population fluctuations. Our results predict an increasing future risk of Oak Processionary Moth (OPM) outbreaks and further spread if the frequency of severe spring/summer droughts increases with global warming.

TI  - Population establishment of the leafroller Eudemis gyrotis (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae) at a new plantation of bayberry Myrica rubra (Myricaceae)
AB  - To clarify the immigration process of a phytophagous insect to a new habitat, I-examined seasonal changes in the abundance and parasitism of larvae and pupae of a leafroller, Eudemis gyrotis (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), at both a new and an old plantation of the bayberry Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc. (Myricaceae) on Mt. Tanakami, Shiga Prefecture, central Japan, in 1999. E. gyrotis adults singly lay eggs on only young leaves of M. rubra, and their larvae feed on the leaves. Therefore, the young leaves of M. rubra are necessary for the occurrence of E. gyrotis larvae: The number of E. gyrotis larvae per tree was correlated with the amount of young leaves per tree. At the old plantation where E. gyrotis had already been found in 1998, the larval occurrence of E. gyrotis began, in late May. At the new plantation, which was at a distance of ca. 600 m from the old plantation, E. gyrotis larvae had not occurred by late July, although there was an abundance of young leaves of M. rubra in late May. These findings suggest that E. gyrotis adults that had emerged from the old plantation in July immigrated to the new plantation and laid eggs on the plants there. The parasitoids that attacked E. gyrotis at the new plantation just after immigration were polyphagous. This suggests that those parasitoids switched hosts from other herbivore species to E. gyrotis. In spite of the attack by polyphagous parasitoids, the E. gyrotis population successfully established itself at the new plantation.

TI  - How does host abundance affect oviposition and fecundity of Mnesampela privata (Lepidoptera : Geometridae)?
AB  - In native forests in Australia, Mnesampela privata (Guenee) is uncommon, but in plantations, populations can outbreak. Two field trials (GES1 and GES2) were used to test whether oviposition on individual hosts by M. privata increases under plantation conditions of high host abundance. Oviposition on designated target trees was recorded over two consecutive seasons in arboreta where the relative abundance of preferred Eucalyptus hosts decreased, whereas the relative abundance of less preferred or noneucalypt trees increased. Neither trial supported the hypothesis that more eggs are laid on individual hosts when surrounded by trees of the same species. On the contrary, in the third arboretum type in GES2 (lowest relative abundance of eucalypts), more eggs were laid on target eucalypts whose immediate neighboring trees were noneucalypts. The average size of egg clutches increased between 1.3 and 11.7 times from the first to the second season of surveys, and the weight of females increased over the two consecutive seasons, which may have explained the increase in egg clutch size. It is proposed that outbreaks of M. privata occur in eucalypt plantations because high host abundance (and presumably also quality) drives the development of populations that are larger than can be supported by native forests.

TI  - Forest modification affects diversity (but not dynamics) of speciose tropical pyraloid moth communities
AB  - We studied temporal and spatial dynamics of extremely diverse moth ensembles (Lepidoptera: Pyraloidea) along a gradient of forest disturbance ranging from undisturbed primary tropical rain forest to different kinds of modified forest and open cultivated land at the margin of Mount Kinabalu National Park (Sabah, East Malaysia). We sampled moths by light trapping during two periods (March-May and August-September 1997). We collected a total of 7724 individuals representing 680 species during 78 light-trapping nights at six study sites. Species diversity (Fisher's alpha.) of ensembles in undisturbed primary forest was distinctly higher than in disturbed or secondary forest. More pyraloid moths were attracted in undisturbed primary forest. Samples from disturbed primary or old-growth secondary forest were statistically indistinguishable from the undisturbed primary forest ensemble in regard to species composition. Thus, pyraloid ensembles from disturbed forest with tall trees remaining appeared to represent impoverished subsets of the undisturbed primary forest community. The more heavily disturbed sites had a distinct fauna and showed a stronger faunal differentiation among each other. Four species of the genus Eoophyla, in which aquatic larvae feed on algae in fast-running streams benefited prominently from forest disturbance. Temporal variation of ensembles was remarkably concordant across the disturbance gradient. Relative abundance variation of the commonest species was identical at all sites. Overall, pyraloid moths responded more sensitively to anthropogenic habitat alteration than most other moth taxa studied thus far in tropical regions and allowed for an analysis of diversity patterns at a high temporal resolution.

TI  - The applicability of the plant vigor and resource regulation hypotheses in explaining Epiblema gall moth-Parthenium weed interactions
AB  - A basic question in insect-plant interactions is whether the insects respond to, or regulate plant traits, or a complex mixture of the two. The relative importance of the directions of the influence in insect-plant interactions has therefore been articulated through both the plant vigor hypothesis (PVH) and the resource regulation hypothesis (RRH). This study tested the applicability of these hypotheses in explaining the interactions between Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) and its stem-galling moth, Epiblema strenuana Walker (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Parthenium plants exposed to galling were sampled at three sites in north Queensland, Australia, over a 2-year period, and the relationship between gall abundance and plant vigor (plant height, biomass, flowers per plant, and branches per plant) was studied. To test the predictions of PVH and RRH, the vigor of parthenium plants protected from galling using insecticides was compared to galled plants and plants that escaped from galling. The vigor of ungalled plants was less than the vigor of galled plants. The higher plant vigor in galled plants was not due to galling, as was evident from insecticide exclusion trials. The insect seemed to preferentially gall the more vigorous plants. These findings support the predictions of the PVH and are contrary to those of RRH. Since gall abundance is linked to plant vigor, galling may have only a limited impact on the vigor of parthenium. This has implications for weed biological control. If the objective of biological control is to regulate the population of a plant by a galling insect, a preference for more vigorous plants by the insect is likely to limit its ability to regulate plant populations. This may explain the paucity of successes against biocontrol of annual weeds using gall insects.

TI  - Diversity and faunistic analysis of Sphingidae (Lepdoptera) in areas of brejo and caatinga in Paraiba State, Brazil.
AB  - Sphingidae assemblages of a highland humid forest (brejo) and a caatinga area were studied from specimens collected with light traps, during twelve months (March, 2000 to February, 2001), with the objective of knowing the diversity and establishing some parameters aiming at monitoring of these areas. Nineteen species were collected, fifteen from brejo and fourteen from caatinga. Ten species are common to both areas, five were collected only in brejo and four in caatinga. Callionima grisescens elegans (Gehlen, 1935) was the most abundant species in two areas. The distribution of species abundance in brejo follows the truncated log normal model. In caatinga the distribution pattern of abundance was not discriminated by the X2 test, although indirect evidence indicates a tendency to the log series model. The assemblage structure (parameters) was estimated from the diversity indices. In brejo, where the eveness was larger, Shannon and Brillouin indices surpass those from caatinga. In this location,Simpson and Berger-Parker indices are much higher due to a larger dominance. The population fluctuation for both Sphingidae assemblages, shows that their populations are affected by rain distribution during the year, or more precisely, by the period of water replacement in the soil, as demonstrated by the water balance.

TI  - Spatial analysis of pheromone trap catches of codling moth (Cydia pomonella) in two heterogeneous agro-ecosystems, using geostatistical techniques
AB  - From 2000 to 2002, local distribution and dispersion patterns of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), captured in pheromone traps were investigated in two heterogeneous agro-ecosystems (A and B) of the Molise region, in central Italy. The main objectives of this study were to determine the temporal and spatial variations in distribution and abundance of codling moth inside and outside apple orchards located in these study areas, and to evaluate the importance of the presence of several host plants in relation to the observed distribution. Trap catches of male moths were clumped during almost all sampling weeks. Spatial characterizations obtained by means of geostatistical methods illustrate that the high trap capture foci were confined to the productive apple orchards for both agro-ecosystems or in small groups of apple trees, and in the case of study area B, in a zone containing pear trees, service trees and walnut trees. Occasionally moths were found in traps installed outside these zones. Furthermore, the position of high male population foci seems not to change during a single flight period. The results obtained are discussed with respect to the improvement of Integrated Pest Management programs employed in apple orchards situated in heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Efficacy of wing versus delta traps for predicting infestation levels of four generations of the Nantucket pine tip moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in the Southern United States
AB  - The use of pheromone trap catches to reliably predict damage by the Nantucket pine tip moth, Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock), in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations would provide forest managers with a valuable integrated pest management tool. At 17 sites throughout four states in the southern United States, in areas where R. frustrana has four annual generations, adult moths were monitored throughout the year (2002) using two types of pheromone traps, and subsequent infestation levels were determined for each tip moth generation. Cumulative wing trap catch tallies up to published spray dates for three of four adult emergence periods were highly predictive of top whorl damage during the subsequent generation using linear regression models. Multiple linear regression that included initial average tree height as a covariate did not significantly improve model efficacy. Cumulative delta trap catch tallies up to the spray date were not predictive of subsequent damage levels for any tip moth generation using linear regression models. Although multiple linear regression incorporating tree height as a covariate did greatly improve delta trap model efficacy, the power and significance of these models remained insufficient. Wing traps seem to be much more sensitive to tip moth population change than delta traps; however, both are useful for monitoring seasonal activity and initiation of spray timing models.

TI  - Yuccas, yucca moths, and coevolution: A review.
AB  - The obligate pollination mutualism between yuccas (Agavaceae) and yucca moths (Lepidoptera, Prodoxidae), in which the adult moth pollinates yucca flowers and her progeny feed on developing seeds, is one of the classically cited examples of coevolution. While known since 1872, our understanding of the ecology and evolution of this association has increased dramatically in the past decade. Here I review current information on organismal diversity and phylogenetic relationships, ecological relationships, origin and reversal of the mutualism, and the potential for analyzing patterns of co-speciation and the historical role of coevolution on specific traits in driving diversification in the interaction. Major novel developments in recent years include the recognition of a large species complex of pollinators, previously thought to be one polyphagous species; a majority of all moth species are monophagous. Considerable life history diversity has been unveiled, and mechanisms that maintain a mutualistic equilibrium by preventing over-exploitation documented. Phylogenetic and ecological information, including data from other, newly discovered facultative pollinators in the Prodoxidae, have been used to erect a hypothesis for the evolution of obligate mutualism. Application of a molecular clock to phylogenetic data suggests that the plant-moth association arose at least 40 Mya, and that the obligate mutualism evolved very quickly after this event. Two separate events of reversal of mutualism have been identified, involving derived "cheater" moth species that oviposit into fruits resulting from pollination by other pollinator species. This appears to have happened not through selection for cheating, but rather as a byproduct of a phenological shift to an unexploited seed resource, in which case pollination behavior became redundant. Analyses of parallel diversification and character coevolution are hampered by incomplete phylogenetic information at the species level, especially for the plants, but also for the pollinators. Available data indicate considerable deviation from strict co-speciation, and no evident examples of this process. Analyses of the role of coevolutionary processes in driving the diversification of yuccas and yucca moths will be possible once fully resolved phylogenies become available.

TI  - Pollinator divergence within an obligate mutualism: Two yucca moth species (Lepidoptera; Prodoxidae: Tegeticula) on the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia; Agavaceae).
AB  - Yucca moths are widely recognized for their role as highly specific pollinators and seed-eaters on yuccas, making them part of one of the major models of obligate mutualism. Here we describe Tegeticula antithetica Pellmyr (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae), a new pollinator species of Yucca brevifolia (Joshua tree). Biological information is provided. Molecular phylogenetic data show the two pollinators of Y. brevifolia to be sister taxa, and a molecular clock estimates their divergence to apprxeq10.7 million years ago. This is the first documented instance of pollinator moth divergence and speciation within a host plant. The known geographic ranges of the two species do not overlap. We discuss the historical biogeography of Y. brevifolia and its implications for moth diversification.

TI  - The impact of fungicides on Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson epizootics and on populations of Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), on soybean.
AB  - The fungus Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson is one of the most important natural enemies of soybean caterpillars, mainly under humid weather conditions. Outbreaks of the fungus Microsphaera diffusa Cooke & Peck have demanded fungicide applications on soybeans, which could result in outbreaks of noctuid populations by reduction of the natural inocula of N. rileyi. The recommended fungicides have shown to be detrimental to beneficial fungi, reducing infection, delaying epizootics, and resulting in increased host population densities. In laboratory assays, benomyl, difenoconazole, sulphur and carbendazim affected conidial germination of N. rileyi, being the latter less deleterious. To assess the impact of fungicides used to control M. diffusa, on N. rileyi, two tests were carried on, spraying difenoconazole (75 g a.i./ha) and benomyl (262.5 g a.i./ha) on soybean plots. In the 1997/98 trial, fungicide was sprayed once on soybean plants at R1-R2 developmental stages. In the 1998/99 test, two applications were made, when plants were at V5 and V7 developmental stages, respectively. The number of VBC larvae was significantly higher in the fungicide treated plots than in the control plots. In the 1997/98 test, benomyl treated plots resulted in higher populations of VBC than in the control or in the difenoconazole plots. In the 1998/99 test, VBC population was higher from 7 to 12 days after the first application, and remained high until 19 days after the second application. In general, fungicide treatments delayed the begining of N. rileyi epizootics from 2 to 14 days.

TI  - Genetic shifts in Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) over a year in the Dawson/Callide Valleys.
AB  - Microsatellites were used to analyse 68 collections of Helicoverpa armigera in the Dawson/Callide Valleys in central Queensland. The study aimed to evaluate the genetic structure in this region over a 12-month period (September 2000-August 2001). The results detected genetic shifts in H. armigera collections, with genetic changes occurring month by month. Collections in any month were genetically distant from the preceding month's collections. There was no observed difference between collections of H. armigera from the Biloela region and those found in the Theodore region of central Queensland. The data support the current area-wide management strategies for H. armigera by reinforcing the importance and contribution of local management practices. The study also indicates a need for the continuation of regional or Australia-wide approaches to management of the low levels of immigration that are occurring, and for future high pest pressure years.

TI  - Predispersal seed predation of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus).
AB  - Field experiments were conducted in 1999 and 2000 to determine if (1) seed predation of redroot pigweed plants occurred in agricultural fields, (2) corn-cropping patterns could be manipulated to influence the quantity of weed seed predation, and (3) alterations in corn canopies affected the microenvironment, possibly influencing predator populations. Corn was planted in standard (75 cm) or narrow (37.5 cm) rows with corn population densities ranging from low to very high (2.5 to 10 plants m-2). The extent of seed predation occurring on terminal weed inflorescences in the treatments was evaluated. Predation levels of redroot pigweed were highly variable spatially and temporally. Coleophora lineapulvella Chambers (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae) was the dominant predator of redroot pigweed seed. Seed predation was higher in 2000 than in 1999 (P<0.05). On average, C. lineapulvella larvae attacked 11% of the inflorescences in 2000 and 3% of inflorescences in 1999. The proportion of damaged seeds per attacked inflorescence was as high as 93% in 2000 but only 42% in 1999. Row spacing and corn density did not affect levels of weed seed predation (P>0.05). But canopies of closely spaced corn increased shading to redroot pigweed plants growing below the canopy, consequently decreasing total weed biomass and seed production.

TI  - Egg and larval survivorship of Carposina sasakii (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae) in apple and peach and their effects on adult population dynamics in orchards.
AB  - Egg and larval survivorship of Carposina sasakii Matsumura in fruits was investigated, and its effects on adult population dynamics was examined by comparing the seasonal adult population trends in apple and peach orchards. Egg survivorship was relatively high and did not differ among fruits, cultivars, and seasons. However, larval survivorship in fruits was very low according to fruits, cultivars, and seasons. In late apple ('Fuji'), no larvae survived inside fruits during mid- to late June, and larval survivorship in mid-July was very low (2.0%). In early apple ('Tsugaru') and early peach ('Kurakatawase'), larval survival was 18.1 and 43.7% during mid- to late June, respectively. However, in late peach ('Hakuto'), it was much lower (4.5%). The mean numbers of degree-days between the first and the last adult flight peaks were significantly different among different orchard systems. Significantly more degree-days occurred in apple (1029.8 DD) and apple-peach adjacent orchards (939.2 DD) than in peach orchards (681.0 DD). This could have been caused by high larval mortality in apples during the early season, and a mixture of both multivoltine and univoltine components contributing to C. sasakii overall population dynamics. Implications for management of C. sasakii in diverse fruit systems are discussed.

TI  - Trends in Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) abundance on commercial cotton in central Queensland: Implications for pest management
AB  - Within and between-season patterns of Helicoverpa egg and larval abundance on commercial cotton in central Queensland were analysed using crop scouting data for 5 farms over 9 consecutive growing seasons (1989/90-1997/98). Within seasons, analysis of mean weekly egg density profiles for individual farms reveals asynchronous oviposition activity among farms for approximately the first 8 weeks of the growing season. Beyond 8 weeks oviposition activity appears to be well synchronised among farms. Weekly egg density profiles differed significantly between seasons. Mean larval density increases linearly throughout the season. Medium and large larvae were detected on cotton as early as 5-6 weeks after planting. The ecological significance of oviposition activity and larval survival patterns on cotton is discussed. Pesticide application and control strategies are discussed.

TI  - Distribution and sampling of Maruca vitrata (Fabricius) (Lep., Pyralidae) larvae on Lonchocarpus sericeus (Poir) H.B. and K
AB  - The spatio-temporal distribution of the pod borer Maruca vitrata was assessed on Lonchocarpus sericeus over a period of 6 months, in order to develop sampling plans and facilitate sampling on this host plant. Lonchocarpus sericeus, one of the preferred alternative host plants of M. vitrata is widely spread in Benin and should therefore be included in the ecological management of the insect. Some experiments were conducted at an ecological site in south Benin, where L. sericeus can be found. The analysis of 17 weekly samples showed that tree canopy did not have a significant effect (P=0.3471) on larval distribution. Significant differences (P=0.0001) were obtained between the sizes of flowers (10, 20, 30 and 40 racemes). Geographical quadrants consisting of the upper east branches, lower east branches, upper west branches and lower west branches did not differ significantly (P=0.8713). The time of infestation of L. sericeus by M. vitrata was investigated by taking samples every 2 days. Data analysis of these samples revealed that L. sericeus was infested at the open flower stage. Temporal distribution of larvae showed the greatest abundance of larvae occurred in June. The index of aggregation was 1.37 with the TAYLOR law and 1.26 with the Iwao procedure. These values showed that the larval dispersion pattern is negative binomial. On this basis, sequential sampling plans were developed and these could permit an accurate estimate of tree data for sampling.

TI  - Mating disruption of the corn borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) using sprayable formulations of pheromone
AB  - Field trials to evaluate efficacy of two sprayable formulations of a binary pheromone blend of the maize pest Sesamia nonagrioides, were carried out from 1997 to 1999 in Spain, Greece and France. Efficacy was measured through inhibition of trap catches in treated fields and reduction of pest population growth between the first and second generations. Most treated fields showed over a 60% of trap catch inhibition within the 15 days following pheromone application. Reduction of pest population increase was variable in Spain and Greece according to the year, but mostly higher than 60%, and consistently high in France where values were above 65% during the 3 years in all replicates. Pheromone release rate was high during the first 2-3 days following application: less than 20% of the pheromone components sprayed remained on or were adsorbed into leaves 4-5 days after application. The effectiveness of mating disruption to control the S. nonagrioides population was at least as good as chemical application and additionally it is compatible with biological control applied in some areas of southern Europe.

TI  - Influence of historical land use and modern agricultural expansion on the spatial and ecological divergence of sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in Brazil
AB  - Human-mediated changes in landscapes can facilitate niche expansion and accelerate the adaptation of insect species. The interaction between the evolutionary history of the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius, and historical and modern agricultural activity in Brazil shaped its spatial genetic structure, facilitating ecological divergence and incipient host shifting. Based on microsatellite data, STRUCTURE analyses identified two (K = 2) and three (K = 3) significant genetic clusters that corresponded to: (a) a strong signal of spatial genetic structure and, (b) a cryptic signal of host differentiation. We inferred that K = 2 reflects the footprint of agricultural activity, such as expansion of crop production (sugarcane and maize), unintentional dispersion of pests, and management practices. In contrast, K = 3 indicated incipient host differentiation between larvae collected from sugarcane or maize. Our estimates of population size changes indicated that a historical bottleneck was associated with a reduction of sugarcane production approximate to 200 years ago. However, a more recent population expansion was detected (>1950s), associated with agricultural expansion of large crop production into previously unfarmed land. Partial Mantel tests supported our hypothesis of incipient host adaptation, and identified isolation-by-environment (e.g., host plant) in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, where sugarcane has been traditionally produced in Brazil. The impact of agricultural production on D. saccharalis may continue, as the current population structure may hinder the efficacy of refuge plants in delaying insect resistance evolution to Bt toxin.

TI  - The potential for using Larix decidua ring widths in reconstructions of larch budmoth (Zeiraphera diniana) outbreak history: Dendrochronological estimates compared with insect surveys
AB  - In the Alps, larch (Larix decidua Mill.) forests show periodic discolouration due to larch budmoth (LBM) outbreaks (Zeiraphera diniana Guenee, Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Tree defoliation causes severe reductions in radial growth, visible in tree rings. This paper aims at reconstructing LBM outbreak history, and critically examining the potential for using dendrochronological data by comparing tree-ring estimates with insect surveys. The occurrence of LBM outbreaks was investigated using 249 cores from larch growing near the timberline in three regions of the French Alps (Brianconnais, Maurienne, and Tarentaise). Years with an abrupt decrease in radial growth (-40%) were considered as negative pointer years reflecting the potential impact of LBM. The comparison with three non-host conifers (Norway spruce, stone and mountain pines) permitted us to distinguish growth reductions in larch due to climatic effects from those due to defoliation by LBM. The dendrochronological data were matched with information reporting conspicuous discolouration in old forestry reports or recovered from systematic field observations. Twenty-two outbreaks are discernible within the period 1800-1983. A peak reduction in larch growth occurred at intervals of 8.86+-1.01 years in the following years: 1801, 1811, 1820, 1830, 1838, 1846, 1857, 1867, 1875, 1884, 1892, 1901, 1909, 1918, 1926, 1936, 1945, 1953, 1963, 1972, 1980, and 1987. Our objective method based on ring measurements and comparison with non-host trees was compared with qualitative techniques based on the visual detection of conspicuous latewood anomalies. Larch in the Brianconnais (which experiences a continental climate) are infested first, whereas the Tarentaise region exhibits a much weaker impact of LBM. Complete tree recovery was observable 3 years after outbreak peaks.

TI  - Changes in hemlock looper (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) pupal distribution through a 3-year outbreak cycle
AB  - The hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria, pupal distribution was studied through a 3-year outbreak cycle near Lac Princeton on Anticosti Island in Quebec. Over the 3 years, 10 balsam fir trees were cut and all pupae were counted on the stem and branches (non-foliated vs foliated parts) of the lower, middle and upper crowns and on the stem below crown. In pre-outbreak conditions, pupae were mostly found on branches of the middle and upper crowns. During the outbreak, pupal density did not increase on these parts of the trees, since pupae were mostly found on the stem, from the ground to the middle crown, and on branches of the lower crown. Few pupae were found on the foliated portion of branches in post-outbreak conditions but most were found on the basal non-foliated part of branches, which appears to be a preferred location for hemlock looper pupation. In order to optimize detection of population increases in monitoring networks, we suggest using pupal traps at breast height on balsam fir trees.

TI  - Responses of litter-dwelling arthropods and house mice to beech seeding in the Orongorongo Valley, New Zealand
AB  - This study investigates further the possibility that eruptions of house mice in forests of southern beech (Nothofagus spp.) in New Zealand after mast seedings are triggered by increases in the populations of some arthropods, especially Lepidoptera larvae and spiders that are common foods of mice, rather than by the beech seed. It reports on a 5-year study of arthropods of the forest floor in hard beech and silver beech forest in the Orongorongo Valley, near Wellington, in relation to (1) litter and seedfall, and (2) the numbers and diet of mice. Litter-feeding larvae of Lepidoptera in both the litter and fermentation layers of the forest floor feed on the fallen male flowers of beech, and most species were more common after heavy flowering of the beeches. A few of the common spiders (including Miturga sp., the main spider eaten by mice) were also more abundant after beech seeding. Analysis of the long-term records of hard beech seeding, numbers of mice, and numbers of adults of the moth Gymnobathra tholodella (Oecophoridae) showed that the number of mice was positively correlated with both the number of beech seeds and the number of moths. These results indicate a more complex web of interactions in beech forest than was earlier suggested, but because the intensity of flowering in spring largely determines the numbers of both Lepidoptera larvae and beech seeds, the role of each in the population increase of mice can not be determined.

TI  - Species richness and fluctuation of defoliator Lepidoptera populations in Brazilian plantations of Eucalyptus grandis as affected by plant age and weather factors
AB  - The effect of plant age and weather factors on species richness and fluctuation of defoliator Lepidoptera populations was investigated in a Eucalyptus grandis plantation subjected to a five-year survey (June 1993-July 1998) in Santa Barbara County, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Adult Lepidoptera were collected every 15 days with five light traps, and the number of individuals per morphospecies in each site was recorded. Lowest numbers of individuals were obtained in July (14.4 +- 4.7 insects/trap) and highest numbers were obtained by late December (86.8 +- 41.1 insects/trap). During the five-year period, 653 species of Lepidoptera were collected and the Geometridae Stenalcidia grosica, Glena unipennaria, and Oxydia vesulia were the most abundant species. The mean seasonal fluctuation of the first two species were positively correlated with the total Lepidoptera fluctuation (p < 0.01; r = 0.6; n = 98), unlike the third species (i.e. O. vesulia) which was poorly correlated with the total fluctuation (p = 0.05; r = 0.2; n = 98). Multiple regression models were developed to assess the relative importance of plant age and weather factors (temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall) affecting species richness and fluctuation of Lepidoptera populations. Plant age and average temperature were the main weather factors affecting species richness and abundance of total individuals and individuals of the species S. grosica. Older plants (six- to seven-years old) and lower temperatures (apprxeq18degreeC) seem to favor species richness and hig her populations of Lepidoptera, especially S. grosica. In contrast, plant age and rainfall were the main factors affecting the fluctuation of G. unipennaria populations which presented higher incidence in older plants (six- to seven-years old) and higher rainfall (apprxeq400 mm). We were unable to develop robust models for fluctuation of O. vesulia populations (r2 < 0.15). The obtained results suggest that high populations of the main defoliator Lepidoptera species present in the area are more likely to occur in plants older than five years and especially during the rainy season (October-March).

TI  - Temporal variation in the genetic structure of host-associated populations of the small ermine moth Yponomeuta padellus (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae)
AB  - Temporal changes in allele frequencies were studied in host-associated populations of the small ermine moth Yponomeuta padellus. At one site, populations from three host plants (Sorbus aucuparia, Amelanchier lamarckii, and Crataegus spp.) were sampled annually during a four-year-period and analysed with 20 polymorphic allozyme markers. At two other sites, allele frequencies at 5-6 enzyme loci of Y. padellus populations from two different host plants were also tested for consistency over a 13-year-period. Significant allele frequency changes occurred in the short-term analysis, whereas allele frequencies remained relatively stable through time in the long-term analyses. Furthermore, allele frequencies of Y. padellus populations from Crataegus spp. were relatively stable compared to the other host populations. The role of the agents responsible for the observed patterns is discussed.

TI  - Effects of phenotypic plasticity on pathogen transmission in the field in a Lepidoptera-NPV system
AB  - In models of insect-pathogen interactions, the transmission parameter (v) is the term that describes the efficiency with which pathogens are transmitted between hosts. There are two components to the transmission parameter, namely the rate at which the host encounters pathogens (contact rate) and the rate at which contact between host and pathogen results in infection (host susceptibility). Here it is shown that in larvae of Spodoptera exempta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in which rearing density triggers the expression of one of two alternative phenotypes, the high-density morph is associated with an increase in larval activity. This response is likely to result in an increase in the contact rate between hosts and pathogens. Rearing density is also known to affect susceptibility of S. exempta to pathogens, with the high-density morph showing increased resistance to a baculovirus. In order to determine whether density-dependent differences observed in the laboratory might affect transmission in the wild, a field trial was carried out to estimate the transmission parameter for S. exempta and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV). The transmission parameter was found to be significantly higher among larvae reared in isolation than among those reared in crowds. Models of insect-pathogen interactions, in which the transmission parameter is assumed to be constant, will therefore not fully describe the S. exempta-NPV system. The finding that crowding can influence transmission in this way has major implications for both the long-term population dynamics and the invasion dynamics of insect-pathogen systems.

TI  - Quantification of biotic responses to rapid climatic changes around the Younger Dryas: A synthesis
AB  - To assess the presence or absence of lags in biotic responses to rapid climatic changes, we: (1) assume that the delta18O in biogenically precipitated carbonates record global or hemispheric climatic change at the beginning and at the end of the Younger Dryas without any lag at our two study sites of Gerzensee and Leysin, Switzerland; (2) derive a time scale by correlating the delta18O record from these two sites with the delta18O record of the GRIP ice core; (3) measure delta18O records in ostracods and molluscs to check the record in the bulk samples and to detect possible hydrological changes; (4) analyse at Gerzensee and Leysin as well as at two additional sites (that lack carbonates and hence a delta18O record) pollen, plant macrofossils, chironomids, beetles and other insects, and Cladocera; (5) estimate our sampling resolution using the GRIP time scale for the isotope stratigraphies and the biostratigraphies; and (6) summarise the major patterns of compositional change in the biostratigraphies by principal component analysis or correspondence analysis. We conclude that, at the major climatic shifts at the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas, hardly any biotic lags occur (within the sampling resolution of 8-30 years) and that upland vegetation responded as fast as aquatic invertebrates. We suggest that the minor climatic changes associated with the Gerzensee and Preboreal oscillations were weakly recorded in the biostratigraphies at the lowland site, but were more distinct at higher altitudes. Individualistic responses of plant and animal species to climatic change may reflect processes in individuals (e.g. productivity and phenology), in populations (e.g. population dynamics), in spatial distributions (e.g. migrations), and in ecosystems (e.g. trophic state). We suggest that biotic responses may be telescoped together into relatively short periods (50 to 150 years), perhaps disrupting functional interactions among species and thus destabilising ecosystems.

TI  - Rainfall and drought in equatorial east Africa during the past 1,100 years
AB  - Knowledge of natural long-term rainfall variability is essential for water-resource and land-use management in sub-humid regions of the world. In tropical Africa, data relevant to determining this variability are scarce because of the lack of long instrumental climate records and the limited potential of standard high-resolution proxy records such as tree rings and ice cores. Here we present a decade-scale reconstruction of rainfall and drought in equatorial east Africa over the past 1,100 years, based on lake-level and salinity fluctuations of Lake Naivasha (Kenya) inferred from three different palaeolimnological proxies: sediment stratigraphy and the species compositions of fossil diatom and midge assemblages. Our data indicate that, over the past millennium, equatorial east Africa has alternated between contrasting climate conditions, with significantly drier climate than today during the 'Medieval Warm Period' (apprx AD 1000-1270) and a relatively wet climate during the 'Little Ice Age' (apprx AD 1270-1850) which was interrupted by three prolonged dry episodes. We also find strong chronological links between the reconstructed history of natural long-term rainfall variation and the pre-colonial cultural history of east Africa, highlighting the importance of a detailed knowledge of natural long-term rainfall fluctuations for sustainable socio-economic development.

TI  - Analysis of long-term light-trap data for Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Australia: The effect of climate and crop host plants
AB  - Regression analyses of a long series of light-trap catches at Narrabri, Australia, were used to describe the seasonal dynamics of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). The size of the second generation was significantly related to the size of the first generation, to winter rainfall, which had a positive effect, and to spring rainfall which had a negative effect. These variables accounted for up to 96% of the variation in size of the second generation from year to year. Rainfall and crop hosts were also important for the size of the third generation. The area and tonnage of many potential host crops were significantly correlated with winter rain. When winter rain was omitted from the analysis, the sizes of both the second and third generations could be expressed as a function of the size of the previous generation and of the areas planted to lucerne, sorghum and maize. Lucerne and maize always had positive coefficients and sorghum a negative one. We extended our analysis to catches of H. punctigera (Wallengren), which declines in abundance after the second generation. Winter rain had a positive effect on the sizes of the second and third generations, and rain in spring or early summer had a negative effect. Only the area grown to lucerne had a positive effect on abundance. Forecasts of pest levels from a few months to a few weeks in advance are discussed, along with the improved understanding of the seasonal dynamics of both species and the significance of crops in the management of insecticide resistance for H. armigera.

TI  - Effect of density of pheromone sources, pheromone dosage and population pressure on mating of pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)
AB  - The effect of density of the Shin-Etsu twist-tie rope pheromone formulation (PBW rope L(R)) on mating of female pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) was tested in Israel. The success of mating disruption was evaluated during 1997 by the mating table technique, comparing the percentage of mating of virgin sentinel females in pheromone-treated and control plots. Under low pest population pressure application of 'long-life' formulation of P. gossypiella pheromone, PBW rope L(R), spaced 9 m, 11 m and 14 m apart, resulted in very high suppression of mating (96.5-100%) and complete shut-down of pheromone trap catch. These application rates were much lower than those now prevailing in Israel and elsewhere. Spacing of ropes 20 m apart resulted in less effective mating disruption of 65% only, and shut-down of pheromone traps was also incomplete. The tests during 1998 were carried out at high pest population and efficacy of treatments was assessed by the reduction of male capturein traps in pheromone-treated plots relative to catches in the control. The distance between pheromone sources proved to be the most critical factor determining success. In both years, any spacing significantly greater than 10 m gave markedly less than complete trap catch shutdown/mating suppression. Pheromone dosages and population density were also important in determining mating success. Results obtained in this study indicate the possibility of reducing the number of pheromone sources per unit area and the total amount of pheromone as compared with that in use today, only at very low pest populations. However at high population levels, dispensers closely-spaced, with increased dosages of pheromone, are required.

TI  - Densities of endophytic fungi and performance of leafminers (Lepidoptera: Eriocraniidae) on birch along a pollution gradient
AB  - We examined densities of endophytic fungi and their associations with performance of Eriocrania leaf-mining moth larvae on white birch (Betula pubescens) and silver birch (B. pendula) around a large copper-nickel smelter in SW Finland. The analysis is based on 2-year data collected from sites distributed along the pollution gradient from 0 to 10.8 km from the smelter. Endophyte densities were low near the smelter in both years, and correlated negatively with foliar concentrations of heavy metals and aerial SO2 levels. Endophyte densities and species composition differed between years. Densities were over two times as high in 1994 compared to 1993. B. pubescens endophyte densities were higher compared to B. pendula throughout the gradient probably due to differences in leaf characteristics of the species. Site-specific correlations among Eriocrania parameters and endophyte densities revealed no consistent patterns, indicating that annual variation in their relationships may be related to other factors, such as environmental conditions and plant quality.

TI  - The relative performance of pheromone and light traps in monitoring the seasonal activity of both sexes of the eastern hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria fiscellaria
AB  - The seasonal flight activity of both sexes of the eastern hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria fiscellaria Guenee (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) was studied during two consecutive years.in Quebec and Newfoundland, using light (L), pheromone (P) and combined light and pheromone (LP) traps. Moth density significantly affected the performance of the different traps, with P traps being more effective at low than high density. However, P trap catches decreased just prior to the onset of female captures, probably as a result of competition between traps and virgin calling females. Nearly all females caught in L and LP traps were already mated and even the first females caught had laid at least half of their egg complement. In Quebec under warm nights, the pattern of male activity occurred at different times, with peak P catches being later in the scotophase than those of L traps, but overall similar numbers of males were caught in both traps. In contrast, under cool nights, males were caught early in the night in both P and L traps, suggesting a strong competition effect between traps, although more males were caught in P than L traps overall. In Newfoundland, the pattern of male captures in L and P traps was similar at both high and low temperatures, so competition between trap types would always be high. Under these conditions P traps were more effective than L traps. Irrespective of the region, year or temperature, significantly more males were captured in LP, with the effect of L and P being additive. In both regions, females responded similarly to L and LP traps with peak activity occurring early in the night. Captures of females were lower than those of males under cool temperatures, suggesting that the temperature threshold for flight is higher for females. The use of L and P traps simultaneously and/or in combination is discussed in relation to integrated pest management programs and ecological considerations.

TI  - Modelling topoclimatic patterns of egg mortality of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) with a Geographical Information System: predictions for current climate and warmer climate scenarios
AB  - 1. Our aim was to quantify the effects of a warmer winter climate on the egg mortality (and, consequently, the risk of an outbreak) of Epirrita autumnata, a serious defoliator of mountain birch. 2. The egg survival of E. autumnata was studied in northernmost Finland from 1993 to 1996, when minimum temperatures were also recorded. Utilizing a digital elevation map with a GIS (Geographical Information System), models were developed for egg survival and minimum temperature, taking into account altitude, local topography and temperatures at a meteorological station in the study area. 3. Areas of high egg mortality of E. autumnata can be modelled in the GIS with reasonable accuracy by the model describing areal distribution of minimum winter temperatures, taking account of the fact that the critical limit for egg survival of E. autumnata in midwinter is about -35.5degreeC. The approach can be applied in short-term forecasting of outbreak areas when previous year population densities and minimum winter temperatures at meteorological stations are known. 4. In our study area, from 1961 to 1991 more than one-third of the years were egg-killing winters in the mixed birch-pine forests zone, and 15% of years in the birch forest zone. In order for an outbreak to take place, at least three consecutive seasons with a high population growth rate are needed; in the mixed birch-pine forests the possibilities of an E. autumnata outbreak during the period 1961-91 were very rare, while in the birch forest zone outbreak possibilities were also noticeably restricted by winter minimum temperatures. 5. If winter warming takes place according to the scenarios presented, by the middle of the next century the birch-growing areas in our study area protected by low temperatures from outbreaks of E. autumnata will be only one-third as great as those of today, and by the end of the next century only one-tenth of those of today. 6. The models and methods described in this paper can be applied to other ecological processes. The modelling strategies and techniques described here serve as intermediate tools for linking large scale climate models (general circulation models, GCMs) and ecological processes happening at a smaller scale.

TI  - Evaluation of some commercially available trap designs and sex pheromone lures for Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
AB  - Three commercially available sex pheromone lures (Trece, Scentry, and Hercon) for the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), were effective for capturing males in Universal Moth Traps (Unitraps). The Trece and Scentry lures were equally effective, and there was some evidence for significantly greater captures with Hercon than with Trece lures. Longevity of the Trece, Scentry, and Hercon lures was 23, 37, and 28-37 d, respectively. Of the trap designs evaluated, Unitraps were the most effective. All-green and all-white Unitraps baited with Trece lures were significantly less effective than those with a green cover, yellow top, and white bottom (multicolored). Multicolored Unitraps captured significantly greater numbers of males than Multipher 1, 2, or 3 traps, and than commercially fabricated wire cone or commercially available Scentry Heliothis traps. Checking the Scentry Heliothis traps daily, rather than at 2- or 3-d intervals, as a way to reduce escape of moths that did not enter the trap tops, did not increase efficacy relative to Unitraps. There was no significant difference between captures in the wire cone and Scentry traps. These data should be useful in developing a standard trapping system for monitoring and population dynamics studies of the beet armyworm.

TI  - Gumleaf skeletoniser Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera: Nolidae) larval outbreaks occur in high rainfall Western Australian jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest after drought
AB  - Larvae of the gumleaf skeletoniser Uraba lugens Walker can be a severe defoliator of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in southwest Western Australia. Extensive outbreaks that developed in the summer of 2010/2011 affected more than 250 000 ha. Rainfall or temperature anomalies correlated over large distances can be a lead to regionally synchronous population dynamics of species. These are known as Moran effects and can result in extensive outbreaks. The effects of spatial variation in regional climate (as measured by dryness index, the ratio of annual pan evaporation and annual rainfall) on the magnitude of outbreak and equilibrium populations of U. lugens were examined using long-term monitoring data. The effects of temporal variation in regional temperature and rainfall anomalies on populations were examined. The coincidence of regional rainfall and temperature anomalies with regional outbreaks was investigated using permutation multivariate analysis of variance and canonical analysis of principal coordinates. Outbreaks resulting in severe defoliation are restricted to high rainfall areas of the southern jarrah forest region in southwest Western Australia. Outbreak years were warmer than years of no known outbreak, yet temperature anomalies were a poor predictor of known multiple outbreaks. Synchronous U. lugens outbreaks coincided with a combination of long-term (seven-year) drying trends and autumn and winter drought. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates analysis using rainfall anomalies correctly predicted multiple outbreaks in 70% of cases. While the mechanisms behind drought as a driver of U. lugens outbreaks are unresolved, U. lugens outbreak may be an early indicator of future lethal stress in jarrah forest. Early insect indicators of stress are likely to allow latitude for early management responses to ameliorate effects of long-term drought on economically and ecologically important tree species.

TI  - Interseasonal variation of Chrysodeixis includens (Walker, [1858]) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) populations in the Brazilian Savanna
AB  - Chrysodeixis includens (Walker, [1858]) is currently the main plusiine pest in the Americas, not only because of the damage caused to soybean, but also with several crop species in a broad geographical range. However, its population dynamics is still poorly understood, despite outbreak records that are commona cross different locations in the Americas. The current study aimed at identifying phenological patterns of C. includens emphasizing its differences among the three years of sampling effort in an intercropping area of the Brazilian Savanna. Thereafter, we tested whether the El Nino size effect, meteorological factors, or soybean, corn and wheat cycles, are better predictors of its monthly abundance. The insects were collected with a light trap during five consecutive nights (repetitions) during 35 new moons. In total, 2026 specimens were collected in all months of the year although not consecutively. Across each year, monthly abundance of C. includens was non-uniform, characterized by sharp population peaks concentrated in the rainy season. These peaks varied from January until March, depending on the year sampled. We found that the local soybean cycle and El Nino effect to significantly influence the species abundance across the entire period of study. These results aid in understanding the species population dynamics and its status as a pest, providing evidence of factors that determine its phenological patterns. Although it presents a very defined phenology, the population dynamics of C. includens varies significantly between years and locations, which demonstrates the importance and need to monitor local populations of larvae and adults for its management.

TI  - Argyresthia moths (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae, Argyresthiinae) on Norway spruce in the West Carpathians
AB  - Three species of the genus Argyresthia Hubner (A. bergiella Ratzeburg, A. amiantella Zeller and A. glabratella Zeller) were studied in Norway spruce forests at an elevation of 380-1550 m in the West Carpathian Mountains (central and western Slovakia). These species have distinct external pupal characteristics and feed marks. They occur together, being more abundant in the middle and upper canopy, and prefer forests at or above 1,000 m, often at the timber line. Their dependence on parent rock was not found. Abundance of these species differed greatly from year to year and any changes in abundance were mostly synchronised at various sites within the same mountain area. A. amiantella was the most abundant species. There is an indication that the outbreaks of Argyresthia moths on Norway spruce might be short-term.

TI  - The use of the butterfly transect method for the study of the nocturnal moth Luperina nickerlii leechi Goater (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and its possible application to other species
AB  - Results are presented from a survey of the nocturnal moth Luperina nickerlii leechi Goater using the well-established butterfly transect method adapted for use at night. This subspecies is in the British Red Data Book 1 (Endangered) and is included in the UK list of globally threatened/declining species. It is found only at one site (in Cornwall) where it forms a small closed population, apparently restricted to where larval foodplant Elytrigia juncea (L.) Nevski grows. Recording at night was achieved by counting resting moths on the first transect pass and flying moths on the return transect. Transect moth counts varied from year to year and were used to provide an annual Index of Abundance. The distribution area where Elytigia juncea dominated the vegetation within the transect and over the whole site was measured and used by comparison with transect counts to provide an annual Population Index, taken at the peak flight period. Capture/mark/recapture surveys were used to give an estimated total site population on one night. Transect counts were generally too low to provide significant indices of abundance, whereas the annual Population Index provided a more meaningful reflection of annual changes in abundance. The usefulness of this method for assessing populations of other nocturnal moths is considered, both for single species and multiple species recording.

TI  - The first record of an outbreak of the larch bud moth, Zeiraphera diniana Gn. (Lep., Tortricidae) on an evergreen conifer host (Pinus pumila (Pall.) Regel) in North-Eastern Asia
AB  - An outbreak of the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana Guenee) occurred from 1988 to 1993 on Pinus pumila ((Pall.) Regel) on Kamchatka Peninsula while the sympatric Larix gmelinii ((Rupr.) Litv.) remained unattacked. This first major outbreak of Z. diniana ever observed and reported on an evergreen host in Siberia and North East Asia is discussed in the larger context of its population dynamics throughout the Palaearctic. The complex interactions between site-, host plant- and insect-characteristics in conjunction with climatic release allows us to explain this unique event in a conventional manner: the eggs survive the extremely cold winter temperatures on dwarf pines underneath the snow; the slow developing light colour morph, which is adapted to the phenology of evergreens, benefits from the mesoclimate close to the ground; it was temporarily favoured by the significantly warmer spring and summer seasons during the outbreak 1988-1991. The occurrence of the pine-feeding Z. diniana in North East Asia supports the hypothesis that the host-associated genetic divergence might have evolved sympatrically.

TI  - Diamondback moth (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in cabbage: Influence of initial immigration sites on population distribution, density and larval parasitism
AB  - Examinations of cabbage plants in five fields near Bunnell, Flagler Co., FL, in spring 1995 showed that larvae of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), were more abundant on the field ends (perpendicular to cabbage rows) adjacent to weed-filled drainage ditches than the fields ends abutting wooded swamp areas. There were no significant differences in the numbers of diamondback moth larvae on cabbage plants on the ends next to other cabbage fields or at sites located within the interior of the fields. Cabbage heads rated for damage due to diamondback moth larvae at harvest showed a distributional pattern similar to that observed for diamondback moth larvae. Parasitism of diamondback moth larvae was not significantly different between field ends and interior fields. Cabbage damage ratings on field sides (parallel to cabbage rows) showed that no edge effect was detected on the sides abutting other cabbage fields, that edge effect only occurred on the first one or few rows on the sides adjacent to other cabbage fields but separated by irrigation ditches, and that edge effect occurred continuously and decreased from the first to the 12th row on sides adjacent to earlier planted cabbage or an open weed-filled ditch area. These results suggest that diamondback moth first invaded cabbage fields from outside areas, and that more diamondback moth spread to the interior of the fields from adjacent open, weed-filled ditches than from bordering wooded and bushy areas.

TI  - Analysis and interpretation of long term light trap data for Helicoverpa punctigera (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae) in Australia: Population changes and forecasting pest pressure
AB  - Using regression analysis the early season dynamics of Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) were determined from long series of light trap catches (10-19 years) from three sites in Australia (Narrabri and Trangie in New South Wales, and Turretfield in South Australia). The size of the second spring generation (G-2, the one causing major pest problems in summer cropping regions) was strongly related to the size of the first spring generation (G-1). In most cases, rainfall in early winter had a positive influence on the size of G-2, whereas rainfall in spring had a negative effect. Regressions were found to account for 49 to 93% of the annual variation in G-2, depending on site. The use of light trap catches and weather data to forecast pest levels from a few months to a few weeks in advance is discussed, along with the improved understanding of early season H. punctigera dynamics.

TI  - The impact of pine looper moth, Bupalus piniaria L. (Lepidoptera; Geometridae) on the growth of Scots pine in Tentsmuir Forest, Scotland
AB  - Pine looper moth (Bupalus piniaria) is an autumn defoliator of pines in Europe, but its impact on tree growth is not well established. Full stem analysis of 40 Scots pine trees felled close to their harvest date in Tentsmuir Forest, Scotland, was used to relate annual growth increments to cyclic fluctuations in B. piniaria densities as recorded by Forestry Commission pupal surveys. Between 1954 and 1989, five peaks in the moth population occurred at Tentsmuir, and radial, cross-sectional area (CA) and volume increments were reduced significantly 1-2 years following each peak. Height increments were reduced after a delay of 3 years. These reductions in increment occurred even though defoliation in the stand was light and B. piniaria densities never exceeded 33 pupae m-2, a density below that normally considered damaging. Temperature variables had some influence on radial, CA and volume increments, and rainfall had an effect on height growth, but the role of climatic factors was small and largely overridden by the greater effect of defoliation. Radial, CA and volume increments were reduced by 17-28% for 2-3 years after peak moth densities, but height growth showed only a small and variable response. Final diameter at breast height, CA, volume and height of the trees at felling were reduced on average by 3.1%, 4.6%, 5.6% and 1.5%, respectively. Wood production at the final crop spacing of 513 stems ha-1 was reduced by 28.3 m-3 ha-1, a loss which would have required a further 2.2 years of unaffected growth at the end of the rotation to have been replaced.

TI  - Factors affecting the numbers of house mice (Mus musculus) in hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) forest
AB  - Nothofagus produces heavy crops of seed infrequently, and then house mouse (Mus musculus) populations increase greatly. In the Orongorongo Valley, near Wellington, seedfall of hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) and the numbers of house mice were measured for 22 years. Four heavy seedings were recorded and the numbers of mice were significantly correlated with the beech seedfall. Most mouse stomachs contained remains of arthropods, especially caterpillars and spiders, as well as plant material. Moths emerging from the litter of the forest floor in summer were sampled for seven years; the numbers of Tingena epimylia (Oecophoridae), whose larvae are litter-feeders, were strongly correlated with beech seedfall. The correlation between the numbers of moths and mice was slightly stronger than that between the numbers of beech seed and mice. Because the numbers of T. epimylia varied so greatly, components of the litterfall were also measured for three years. In a seeding year spent male flowers were a substantial part of the litterfall and might be responsible for the higher numbers of moths. These results indicate that factors other than quantity of seed may be important in the beech seed - mouse relationship and need to be explored further.

TI  - Movements of tortricid moths (Lep. Tortricidae) between apple orchards and adjacent ecosystems
AB  - The movements of tortricids between the apple orchard ecosystem and its surroundings were investigated. To record moth movements a bidirectional Malaise trap was placed on each margin of three IPM (integrated pest managed) and three abandoned apple orchards from the beginning of June to October 1992. Overall flight activity and activity of species associated with apple trees were considered. Diversity was explored by the Shannon-Weaver index and the two management systems were compared. Data were analysed with de-trended correspondence analysis (DCA), Mantel test and single linkage clustering. Results showed that the diversity did not correlate with management, even when the second axis of the DCA separated IPM orchards from abandoned ones. The first axis of the DCA confirmed the importance of the orchards isolation. Superposition of single linkage clustering revealed groups forming using DCA. The Mantel test allowed statistically checking of the similarity between emigrant and immigrant fauna. Two similarity model matrices were tested against data in the Mantel test. The six orchards showed no massive emigration or immigration, an indication that exchanges occurred locally.

TI  - Seasonal trend in population density and adult body size of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), in central Thailand
AB  - Traps baited with a sex pheromone lure were placed in two fields located in Pathum Thani Province in central Thailand to estimate the seasonal trend in population density of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, over a two year periods. Although a large number of moths were captured all year round regardless of different climatic conditions such as dry and rainy seasons, the population density was clearly different between the two fields, indicating that the number of emerging moths varied from place to place even in the same season. The population density declined sharply with the harvest of cruciferous vegetables, and recovered several weeks after the harvest. Forewing lengths of male moths captured in Thailand were constantly short through the year and about the same size as those of males found only in mid-summer in Japan.

TI  - Geographical and temporal distribution of the common armyworm, Mythimna convecta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in eastern Australia: Larval habitats and outbreaks
AB  - Surveys for juvenile Mythimna convecta throughout the agricultural and arid regions of eastern Australia were conducted from 1986 to 1989. Armyworm populations north of 33 degree S were generally dominated by M. convecta, and further south by Persectania ewingii. M. convecta was most widely distributed in spring. Incidence during autumn and winter ranged from very low in Victoria to high in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. Summer infestations were found mostly on the south-east coast where favourable habitats were abundant. Colonised habitats included extremely and regions, where small numbers of larvae were associated with grasses in temporary watercourses, and the higher-rainfall, eastern regions. The largest infestations occurred in south-east Queensland and north central and north-east New South Wales, particularly after heavy autumn rains. There appeared to be two generations of M. convecta over the autumn/winter period: the first a synchronised event starting on the autumn rains and the second commencing in June/July and comprising a wide spread in age distribution. The progeny of the winter generation are probably the source of most economic outbreaks. Mythimna convecta larvae were collected from subtropical and temperate grasses. In the former, most larvae were found in tussocks, particularly of Dichanthium sericeum and Chloris truncata, which provided a dense, fine-leaf crown and canopy. After good autumn rainfall and vegetative growth, the wiry-stemmed tussocks, including Astrebla spp. and C. ciliaris, were also common hosts. The temperate grasses, particularly Avena fatua and Hordeum leporinum, were the main winter hosts although the greatest densities were found only in thick swards of growth, particularly those that contained dried grass. Two of the largest surveys, in autumn 1987 and 1988, followed periods of heavy rain and provided strongly contrasting results. The 1987 survey of central and south-west Queensland located no M. convecta larvae, indicating that densities were below detection thresholds. The paucity of larvae was attributed to lack of suitable atmospheric conditions to assist moth immigrations and absence of adequate populations in potential source areas. The 1988 survey revealed a major outbreak of M. convecta larvae in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. The area received record rains during early April of that year, and the outbreak probably arose from moth migrations from the east and south-east coast. An outbreak of similar scale occurred after further heavy autumn rains in 1989.

TI  - Potato tuber moth Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lep., Gelechiidae) and tuber infestation in Tunisian potato fields: Analysis of the flight phenology
AB  - From 1986 to 1991, pheromone traps were placed in Tunisian potato fields to record weekly the number of male Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller). The data were subjected to a time-series analysis. The coincidence of social events with harvest practices are considered responsible for the relatively high number caught in 1986. In the subsequent years, the pheromone catches gradually decreased, and a linear model was used to remove this trend. A study of seasonality revealed a peak at the beginning of June and another increase in mid-June leading to high catches beyond the period of spring potato crops. After removal of the seasonality the correlogram indicated a stationary stochastic process. By means of a spectral analysis, a four-week cycle, presumably influenced by the moon, and a 10-week cycle, due to unknown causes, were identified. Furthermore, there is an annual cycle related to increasing population densities in spring, i.e. the harvest time of the main-season potato crop.

TI  - Effects of pheromone trap design and placement on capture of male Cydia caryana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae: Olethreutinae) in Alabama pecan orchards and the relationship of trap captures to fruit infestation
AB  - The Pherocon Ic trap captured the greatest number of Cydia caryana (Fitch) adult males and all trap designs appeared to represent population trends equally well. Pooled data from all trap height experiments indicate that traps placed 9.14 m above the orchard floor captured significantly more adult males than those placed at 4.57 m height. Horizontal placement of traps within the tree canopy indicated a significantly greater capture in the central portion of the canopy than at other locations. Correlations between the total capture of male adults and the rate of fruit infestation were not significant.

TI  - Bioerosion rates on coral reefs: Interactions between macroborers, microborers and grazers (Moorea, French Polynesia)
AB  - A two-year experimental study of bioerosion at Moorea Island, French Polynesia, clearly demonstrated the importance of microborers in the initial stages of the establishment of infaunal boring communities. Rates of erosion by micro- and macroborers and by grazers were estimated from measurements of carbonate removal from experimental substrates, using Image Analysis. The studied substrates have been exposed for 2, 6, 12 and 24 months. After 2 months of exposure, the only borers present in the substrates were cyanobacteria and one chlorophyte (Phaeophila sp.) and their bioerosion rate was estimated at 0.6 kg CaCO-3 m-2 yr-1. In the course of the 2 years of exposure, recruitment of macroborers occurred and their estimated rates of erosion increased during this period from 2.15 to 90 g CaCO-3 m-2 yr-1. Carbonate removal by grazers was the dominant agent of erosion, responsible for 89% of the total bioerosion: 2.6 kg CaCO-3 m-2 yr-1, as recorded in substrates exposed for 2 years. The measurable rates of bioerosion by microborers apparently decreased with the time of exposure from 0.6 to 0.2 kg m-2 yr-1, but these values are underestimations which need to be corrected by including the intensity of microboring in substrate layers removed by grazing. Bioerosion is dependent on numerous environmental factors such as depth, light availability, and nutrient supply. A good knowledge of bioerosional processes in modern environments could highlight bioerosion significance in the fossil record.

TI  - Control of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) in apple and pear orchards in Israel by mating disruption
AB  - Control of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), by pheromone-mediated mating disruption, was studied in Israel using two types of dispensers: Shin-Etsu twist-tie (normal and long-life) and TNO matrix formulation (square wafers). Factors affecting mating disruption: initial pest population density, timing of the pheromone application, early season insecticide treatments and monitoring of the pest, were evaluated. Efficacy of mating disruption was assessed by comparing catch of males in pheromone traps located in pheromone-treated and chemically sprayed control plots. Fruit infestation during the season and at picking time was the major criterion to assess mating disruption. The preferred time for pheromone application was before the first flight of the moth. When pheromones were applied at a later stage, one or two early insecticide sprays had to be used to reduce the initial level of the codling moth population. In all tests, trap catch in pheromone-treated plots was drastically reduced as compared with respective control plots. In pheromone-treated plots where total seasonal trap catch (after pheromone application) was less than 12 males/trap, fruit infestation was less than 1.5%; zero trap catch resulted in 0.1-0.3% infestation. At high population levels, mating disruption was ineffective, with the rate of infestation at picking-time being similar in pheromone-treated and control plots. All the field tests indicated that mating disruption with either Shin-Etsu ropes or TNO squares can control codling moth infestations in apple and pear orchards, at relatively low densities of the pest, as efficiently as commercial insecticide sprays.

TI  - The status and conservation of the netted carpet Eustroma reticulatum (Denis and Schiffermueller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), a threatened moth species in Britain
AB  - The netted carpet Eustroma reticulatum is a vulnerable British moth, dependent as a larva on touch-me-not balsam Impatiens noli-tangere which is itself rare as a native plant in the British Isles. We review the status of the moth in Great Britain: it has been recorded from the Lake District since 1856 and sporadically from North Wales, but has had several periods of very low abundance when it was suspected of being extinct. The results of a survey in 1990 of Lake District sites for this moth and a survey in 1991 of potential North Wales sites are presented and compared with Lake District surveys in 1955 and 1980/81. Although the moth increased in numbers between 1955 and 1980, the number of sites in which it now occurs has fallen by 56% - to below 1955 levels. The moth is present in one North Wales site. Threats to colonies and management requirements of moth and foodplant are discussed. Trial management is being carried out by the National Trust in the Lake District.

TI  - The effects of host plant phenology on the demography and population dynamics of the leaf-mining moth, Cameraria hamadryadella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae)
AB  - 1. We examined the effects of variation in the timing of spring leaf production and autumn leaf fall on the survival, mortality and abundance of Cameraria hamadryadella on Quercus alba and Q. macrocarpa. 2. We monitored and manipulated the timing of foliation on field and potted Q. alba trees and observed the abundance of C. hamadrydella on those trees. We also monitored and manipulated the timing of leaf fall on Q. alba and Q. macrocarpa trees in the field and observed its effects on survival, mortality and abundance of C. hamadryadella. 3. Variation in the timing of spring leaf production has no effect on C. hamadryadella abundance. However, a warm winter and spring in 1991 led to accelerated development and the imposition of a facultative third generation in one out of ten years of observation. 4. In 1989, leaves fell relatively early and leaf fall in the autumn accounted for more than 50% of the mortality of C. hamadryadella. In 1990 and 1991 leaves fell relatively late and leaf fall induced mortality was substantially reduced and overwinter survival was markedly increased. 5. The abundance of C. hamadryadella remained constant in the spring and summer of 1990 following the previous autumn's relatively early leaf fall, but increased by 10-fold in the spring of 1991 following the relatively late leaf fall of autumn 1990. The abundance of C. hamadryadella also increased 4-fold between the summer of 1991 and the spring of 1992 after another autumn of relatively late leaf fall. We attribute these increases in abundance in part to reduced mortality because of later leaf fall. 6. Variation in the timing of autumn leaf fall may be responsible for initiating outbreaks of C. hamadryadella.

TI  - Host-plant influence on the population ecology of the jack pine budworm, Choristoneura pinus (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
AB  - 1. Newly-emerged, second-instar jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus Freeman) establish spring feeding sites preferentially in the pollen cones of their host tree, Pinus banksiana Lamb. 2. Laboratory studies showed that the rate of establishment and survival of jack pine budworm on pollen cones was high throughout the entire spring emergence period of the insect. acceptable as feeding sites to the jack pine budworm for a relatively brief period in late spring. 4. Field studies showed that the change in population density of jack pine budworm during the spring emergence stage, as expressed by k-values, was a function of the abundance of pollen cones in the stand. Population reduction was greatest in those stands with the fewest pollen cones. 5. Direct measurement of spring dispersal by jack pine budworm showed that dispersal and consequent losses to the budworm population were greatest in stands with the fewest pollen coned. 6. We conclude that changes in the density of jack pine budworm are strongly influenced by production of pollen cones in the host stand. Because pollen cone production is related to previous years of defoliation by the jack pine budworm, we propose that pollen cones act as a density-dependent factor governing the density of early-stage jack pine budworm. 7. The resulting dynamics are compared to those of other budworm species and used to explain observed regional and temporal patterns of jack pine budworm outbreaks.

TI  - Population dynamics of the potato tuber moth on processing tomatoes in Israel
AB  - The potato tuber moth (PTM), Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a major pest of processing tomatoes, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. (Solanaceae), in Israel. The larvae penetrate the tomato fruit through the stem end and present a serious threat to crop quality. Foliage and fruit samples were taken in nine commercial tomato fields located in Israel's three main tomato growing areas, two of which are potato growing areas as well. PTM was not found where potatoes were absent. Potato harvest in nearby fields was found to be the most significant factor affecting seasonal trends in PTM population density in tomatoes. All four larval instars were found in foliage on all sampling dates. Significantly higher proportions of first instars were found during the population density increase which followed potato harvest. Damaged fruits did not contain first instar larvae, indicating that PTM never undergoes complete development within tomato fruit. Fruit damage levels at harvest were positively correlated to the peak mean population densities on foliage and the date they were observed. In tomato fields not adjacent to potatoes, infestation was first observed at the edge of the field. Both before and after the potato harvest in nearby fields, population density at the edge of the field was significantly higher than at the center. In tomato fields adjacent to potatoes, no significant differences were found between population densities at the edge and center before the potatoes were harvested. After the potato harvest, population density at the center of tomato fields was higher than at the edge.

TI  - Larval parasitism in outbreaking and non-outbreaking populations of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera, Geometridae)
AB  - Larval parasitism of Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen) was monitored during six years in field samples from within the outbreak range of E. autumnata in northern Fennoscandia, and outside it in southern Finland. All parasitoids found were hymenopterans. Six phenologically early species of parasitoids were found in populations within the outbreak range and three species, outside the outbreak range. Two late larval parasitoid species were found within the outbreak range, but none outside the outbreak range. In half of the populations within the outbreak range, early larval parasitoids seemed to increase with a time lag. This is consistent with the cyclic population fluctuations of E. autumnata there. On a small spatial scale (among trees), however, parasitoids acted without a time Parasitism rates by the early larval parasitoids are probably too low (mean 11%) for early parasitoids alone to keep densities of E. autumnata continuously at low levels outside the outbreak range in southern Finland.

TI  - Response of Spodoptera exigua and S. eridania (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) males to synthetic pheromone and S. exigua females
AB  - The seasonal occurrence of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), and the southern armyworm, Spodoptera eridania (Cramer), was monitored over a 2-year period using International Pheromones, Ltd. Moth Traps baited with rubber septa impregnated with pheromone blends identified from conspecific females and also with pheromone emitted by live female beet armyworm moths. The pheromone blend for beet armyworm was (Z)-9-tetradecen-1-ol (2.5%), (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadien-1-ol acetate (87.2%), and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate (10.3%). The pheromone blend used for southern armyworm was (Z)-9-tetradecen-1-ol acetate (55 78%), (Z,E)9,12-tetradecadien-1-ol acetate (21.23%), (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadien-1-ol acetate (8.67%), and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate (14.32%). Although subtropical in habit, both species apparently can survive in North-central Florida even when temperatures drop below freezing for several days. The response of male southern armyworm moths to traps baited with beet armyworm females was remarkably similar to that recorded for southern armyworm males to their synthetic pheromone. This response was consistent over two years.

AB  - Emergence of hickory shuckworm, Cydia caryana (Fitch), adults from larval overwintering sites was bimodal. The major emergence peak occurred during the period of mid-March to mid-May and the smaller activity period during July and August. Pheromone trapping was effective for monitoring population trends during generations 1 and 5 of C. caryana but less so during generations 2, 3, and 4. Activity patterns suggest the species is crepuscular rather than truly nocturnal.

TI  - Analysis of some biological factors affecting differential pheromone trap efficiency between generations in the rice stem borer moth, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)
AB  - Pheromone trap efficiencies in C. suppressalis tend to be relatively low in the first generation as compared to those of the overwintered generation. In order to clarify the factors affecting this phenomenon, three possible biological aspects, such as the male pheromone responsiveness, the flight ability of male moths, and the effect of female population densities were compared between the two generations. The responses of male moths to varying doses of the synthetic sex pheromone were not significantly different between the two generations for each concentration. No significant differences in the flight ability (duration, distance, speed) between the two generations were found. Significant declines in pheromone trap catches with increasing female population densities, evaluated by the light trap catches, were detected in both generations. However, the effects of the female population density were apparently greater in the first generation than in the overwintered one. Consequently, the female population density in the paddy fields was thought to be one of the critical factors affecting the difference in pheromone trap performance between the two generations.

TI  - Impact of late-season orangestriped oakworm (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) defoliation on oak growth and vigor
AB  - The orange striped oakworm, Anisota senatoria (J. E. Smith), has caused widespread defoliation of urban oak (Quercus) species in southeastern Virginia. The hypothesis that consecutive years of late-season defoliation by A. senatoria would cause a significant reduction in Quercus growth and vigor was tested from 1987 to 1990. Late-season A. senatoria defoliation had a significant impact on Quercus growth and vigor. Pin oak, Q. palustris (Muenchhausen), and willow oak, Q. phellos L., planted in fabric containers, had significant reduction in growth with increased defoliation. Starch content and tree vigor in Q. palustris, planted in the urban landscape, was significantly reduced with increased defoliation, and some tree mortality occurred. Quercus phellos was a hardier species compared with Q. palustris and was not significantly affected by consecutive late-season defoliation. In addition, data suggested that Q. palustris was affected more by A. senatoria late-season defoliation when trees were planted in stressed urban sites. These data have important implications for A. senatoria management strategies. High populations that have the potential to cause 100% late-season defoliation during consecutive years should be controlled to prevent progressive decline in tree health.

TI  - The effects of some agrometeorological factors on fluctuation of the legume pod borer, Maruca testulalis Geyer (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), on two cowpea varieties in Nigeria
AB  - An experiment to examine the effects of four agrometeorological factors on population fluctuations in legume pod borer, Maruca testulalis (Geyer) in two cowpea varieties was carried out under field conditions in Ibadan, Nigeria. Plots, 5 times 10 m each, of cowpea varieties IT84S-22464 and Dan ilan were planted fortnightly between 5 May and 5 October 1988 (12 plantings in all for each variety). Three peaks of the pod borer populations were observed on the cowpeas. There were smaller peaks on crops planted between 5 May and 1 June and again between 29 June and 13 July and a larger one on those planted between 24 August and 7 September. These two peaks coincided with the peaks of the rainfall. Significant relationships were obtained between pod borer counts and (a) cumulative rainfall (R-2 = 0.41; P = 0.004) (b) number of rainy days (R-2 = 0.17; P = 0.04) from plant emergence to 50% flowering. These results suggest though, the distribution of rainfall over time is more crucial than the total amount in determining the fluctuations of pod borer populations. Thus, the adjustment of planting dates is suggested as an IPM tactic to avoid the development of damaging levels or pod borer infestations.

TI  - Preventive insecticide resistance strategy in Helicoverpa armigera equals (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Israeli cotton
AB  - Since 1987 an insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy has been implemented in cotton fields in Israel. To assess the efficacy of the IRM strategy, a long-term monitoring program in Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) was undertaken to test the response of this pest to various insecticides. The monitoring technique was based on the exposure of pheromone trap-caught males to residues of four common compounds representing the major groups of insecticides. The diagnostic concentrations, established on LC-80-90 of a susceptible H. armigera field population, were 0.57 mu-g endosulfan, 0.74 mu-g cypermethrin, 0.38 mu-g methomyl, and 2.0 mu-g methidathion per scintillation vials. Collections of H. armigera moths were done during the cotton growing seasons of 1987 through 1991. In general, the results indicate that the susceptibility of H. armigera to the test compounds was not appreciably altered from 1987 to 1991, although fluctuations during the season were observed. In most cases, the resistance levels to the test compounds fluctuated in a typical V-shaped curve during the season. The susceptibility of H. armigera to the various insecticides observed during the course of this study is consistent with the proposition that the IRM strategy can be correlated with successful management of resistance in this pest.

TI  - Population biology of orange-striped oakworm (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) in southeastern Virginia
AB  - Population biology of orangestriped oakworm, Anisota senatoria (J. E. Smith), was studied in southeastern Virginia. Egg mass size was larger on Quercus palustris Muench., pin oak, compared with Q. phellos L., willow oak. Females produced a sex pheromone that attracted male moths. Blacklight traps were not effective for monitoring A. senatoria adults. Peak male emergence occurred on 2 July, 4 days earlier than female. The mean life span was 33.5 days in the laboratory. Pupal mortality was high and only 1.2% of the pupae produced moths in 1989 and 1990. Pupae were capable of overwintering for two years in the field. The first report of a second generation from September-November was documented. Second generation A. senatoria oviposited more egg masses, infested more trees and had a longer development time compared with first generation. Large egg mass size, pupae that were capable of overwintering for two years and the presence of a second generation may partially explain the consistent A. senatoria populations that have occurred in southeastern Virginia.

TI  - RESISTANCE OF SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE TO A NUCLEAR POLYHEDROSIS VIRUS IN THE FIELD AND LABORATORY
AB  - Median lethal doses (LD50s) of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) were determined in neonatal offspring of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Sf) larvae captured in southeastern Louisiana [USA] in 1981, 1982 and 1984. These LD50s ranged from 1.8 to 16.3 polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIB)/insect. The LD50s significantly (P < 0.05) increased during the season of 1982 but had no pattern in 1981 or 1984. However, the Sf populations increased in heterogeneity of response to the NPV during all 3 years. The LD50 increased from 4.1 to 18.7 PIB/insect in a Sf laboratory colony exposed to the NPV LD80 for 7 generations, whereas in a control colony not exposed to NPV the LD50 was 5.9 PIB/insect after 7 generations.

TI  - PHENOLOGY OF THE ADULT CELERY LOOPER SYNGRAPHA-FALCIFERA LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE IN IOWA USA EVIDENCE FOR MIGRATION
AB  - Ovarian dynamics indicate that the celery looper, Syngrapha falcifera (Kirby), does not overwinter in Iowa. Additionally, early spring population trends, ovarian dynamics, and associated weather patterns strongly imply that the celery looper is a migrant into the state. Estimated celery looper development requirements of 377 degree-days per generation with developmental thresholds of 8.3.degree. C minimum and 32.6.degree. C maximum were determined from field data by the least-variability method. Developmental requirements and ovarian dissections allowed the discrimination of four complete generations in 1984 through 1986.

TI  - VARIANCE IN NUMBER OF EGGS PER PATCH OVIPOSITION BEHAVIOUR AND POPULATION DISPERSION IN A SEED PARASITIC MOTH
AB  - 1. The relationship between oviposition behaviour and population dispersion was analysed for Greya subalba Braun (Lep., Incurvariidae), a species in which females usually, but not invariably, lay eggs in only a few schizocarps (seed-pairs) on each umbellet they visit on Lomatium dissectum (Umbelliferae). During each of four years females exhibited a constant probability of leaving an umbellet after each egg was laid. Hence, some umbellets received more eggs than others and the behaviour matched a geometric distribution of eggs among umbellets. 2. The variance in number of schizocarps attacked per umbellet by individual females did not result from females choosing schizocarps of particular sizes or avoiding schizocarps that already contained eggs or larvae. A potential, but speculative, explanation of the variance is that females distribute their eggs among umbellets in a way that maximizes unpredictability on larval dispersion to a searching parasitoid. The pattern of oviposition by Greya females fits the truncated geometric distribution that is predicted if information, as indexed by the Shannon-Wiener entropy measure, is minimized. None the less, other measures of unpredictability or minimum information are possible, and the results highlight the problem of how to identify patterns of movement that may result from selection for unpredictability to enemies. 3. In systematic surveys of the L. dissectum population during three consecutive years, virtually all plants had between 10% and 65% of their seeds attacked. Hence, the separation of oviposition bouts between umbellets and the constant probability of leaving an umbellet after each egg was laid resulted in a broad distribution of Greya attack among L. dissectum plants.

TI  - CORN EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE IN SOUTHWEST IDAHO USA PREDICTION OF INTENSITY OF INFESTATION
AB  - Corn earworms, Heliothis zea (Boddie), are a major pest in the major sweet corn seed-growing area of the United States. In an effort to predict corn earworm infestations, populations per 10 ears were recorded over a period of 8 yr, 1971-1978. Growing degree-days (GDD) were calculated (thresholds of 13 and 35.degree. C) for 1970-1978. Chronological dates for photoperiod necessary for diapause induction were also determined. Correlations of peak corn earworm populations with GDD during the previous year were calculated. Highest degree of correlation occurred between GDD on 23 September and the peak population the following year. A theory is presented to explain the relationship of accumulated GDD on 23 September and the peak corn earworm population the following year.

TI  - SEASONAL CHANGES IN BOLLWORM LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE MOTH CATCHES IN PHEROMONE TRAPS IN A LARGE AREA
AB  - Bollworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie), pheromone traps were spaced 3.2 km apart and were arranged in a 9 .times. 7 grid pattern covering 492 km2. Traps were operated from early April through late September in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Moth catches in traps were correlated with cropping patterns (land use) and with rainfall. Bollworm moth catches during the spring months were highest in areas planted with wheat. As the wheat matured, more moths were caught in areas planted with cotton, guar, and sorghum. Fewer moths were caught adjacent to fallow fields and rangeland throughout the season. Moth catches during the spring were not correlated with catches during the summer; but beginning in June, moth catches during the summer months maintained a positive, significant correlation with each other. One major shift in moth distribution patterns occurred during June, a time when wheat was harvested and summer crops had emerged after planting. In 2 yr, moth catches during the spring months were positively and significantly correlated, and there were positive, significant correlations between summer months in all 3 yr. These between-year correlations indicate that there was some similarity over time in the patterns of change in moth catches. Catches during late season were not indicative of patterns of catches during early spring the following year. There were some significant, positive correlations between moth catches and rainfall. Rainfall may be an additional factor influencing moth distribution in regions dominated by dryland crop production.

TI  - PARASITOID COMPLEXES AND PATTERNS OF PARASITIZATION IN THE GENUS YPONOMEUTA LATREILLE LEPIDOPTERA YPONOMEUTIDAE
AB  - Sympatric speciation processes initiated by a host plant shift are thought to have occurred within the genus Yponomeuta. To find out whether these shifts may have resulted in an escape from parasitoids, the parasitoid complexes of 7 Yponomeuta-species have been compared. For that purpose, data from a sampling survey of 10 years in the Netherlands were used. Fluctuations from year to year and/or from one locality to another were excluded by comparing samples of Yponomeuta-species that were collected at the same place and on the same day. The parasitoid complexes of most of the species studied differ mainly in pattern of parasitisation: the same parasitoid species were reared from each of them, but in significantly different quantities. Only the parasitoid complexes of Y. plumbellus and Y. vigintipunctatus differ in composition from each other and from those of the other species. The results do not give rise to the supposition that shifts to other host plants were attended by an escape from parasitoids restricted to the former host plants.

TI  - SEASONAL ABUNDANCE OF LESSER CORNSTALK BORER LEPIDOPTERA PYRALIDAE ADULTS IN SOYBEAN PEANUT CORN SORGHUM AND WHEAT IN NORTHERN FLORIDA USA
AB  - Adult abundance of lesser cornstalk borer (LCB), Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller), in agronomic crops in northern Florida was determined by pheromone trapping. Trap captures revealed that the temporal pattern of adult abundance differed for each crop. Multiple generations occurred in peanut and grain sorghum fields, with adults in abundance during both vegetative and reproductive crop-growth stages. Adults were abundant in the soybean fields only during vegetative and early reproductive crop-growth stages, with captures comprising individuals of two generations. Adults were abundant in wheat fields only during early seedling stages, while few adults were collected at any time in corn fields. Trap captures further indicated that there was rarely any considerable overlap between adult populations of different generations. The temporal patterns and magnitudes of adult captures were similar in fields of the same crop planted on about the same date, but dissimilar in fields of different crops or fields of the same crop planted on different dates.

TI  - DENSITY OF THE LESSER CORNSTALK BORER ELASMOPALPUS-LIGNOSELLUS ZELLER IN PEANUT FIELDS ENDEMIC AND OUTBREAK POPULATION CONFIGURATIONS
AB  - The population growth of Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller), the lesser cornstalk borer (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was determined in conventionally tilled Florunner peanut fields in endemic (1983-1985) and outbreak (1986) population configurations. The density of E. lignosellus eggs, larvae, and pupae was estimated by weekly soil flotation and by soil sieving. Adult density and abundance was estimated with pheromone traps, emergence cages, and flush samples. In the endemic years, low levels of eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults occurred throughout the growing season. Adult populations exhibited 1-2 weak peaks per growing season. The outbreak year was characterized by an exponential increase in E. lignosellus eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. A regression relationship was developed from the 1983-1986 data that relates the weekly mean number of E. lignosellus larvae per meter determined by soil sieving to the total rainfall (cm) and the number of hot(.gtoreq.35 C daily maximum temperature) days in the previous 30 days. This is a predictive tool that can be used to time sampling to predict possible larval population increases before extensive damage occurs.

TI  - REPRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY OF THE EUROPEAN CORN BORER OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS HBN. LEPIDOPTERA PYRALIDAE UNDER CONSTANT LOW TEMPERATURES
AB  - Various aspects of the reproductive activity of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, have been studied at relatively constant low temperatures ranging from 11 to 16.degree. C. The experiment was run under laboratory conditions with a 16-hour light period on adults whose larvae had been collected in nature during the spring of 1982 and 1983. Mating rarely occurred below 13.degree. C. Oviposition became negligible below a temperature threshold whose value changed during the two years of the experiment (15.degree. C in 1982 and 13.degree. C in 1983). Below these values the number of fecund females of eggs per female decreased considerably and many deposited eggs were sterile. The mean number of eggs per egg-mass did not change with temperature. Over the relatively low temperature range where oviposition occurred at a rather high level, decline in temperature had a progressive effect, and oviposition lasted for a longer period during the adult life than at 25 .degree. C (reference temperature).

TI  - DISTRIBUTION OF THE AFRICAN ARMYWORM SPODOPTERA-EXEMPTA LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE AND THE FREQUENCY OF LARVAL OUTBREAKS IN AFRICA AND ARABIA
AB  - Spodoptera exempta (Walker) occurs very widely in Africa south of the Sahara and in south-western Arabia, and more intermittently in the eastern Indian Ocean and Pacific areas. Throughout its range, the extent and frequency of its attacks have increased markedly, especially in the last 10-15 years. In parts of Africa and in south-western Arabia it is now regularly a seasonally important pest; examples are given of monthly distribution maps of the frequency of its attacks in this region. Maps such as these provide a useful and wide-based perspective for those concerned with prediction, survey and control of S. exempta in a more limited area and with little or no access to information from other territories. Year to year variations within the general patterns derived from many years' records are illustrated by the distribution of outbreaks in three recent seasons, in all of which there were outbreaks in at least seven countries of central and eastern Africa, in two years in Arabia, and in one year also in southern and western Africa.

TI  - EVALUATION OF HIGH-CAPACITY NONSATURATING SEX PHEROMONE TRAPS FOR MONITORING POPULATION DENSITIES OF SPRUCE BUDWORM CHORISTONEURA-FUMIFERANA LEPIDOPTERA TORTRICIDAE
AB  - The efficiency of two sticky-bottomed traps and seven high-capacity, nonsticky traps in catching male spruce budworm [Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)] moths was evaluated in a wind tunnel. The place where the male moths first contacted the trap, the length of time that passed until they entered the trap, and the number remaining in the trap after 5 min were recorded. The most efficient traps were the Pherocon 1C, a sticky-bottomed trap, and the Multi-Pher and Uni-trap, both nonsticky traps with internal funnel-shaped baffles that prevents moths from escaping. As sticky traps become saturated at relatively low densities they are not suitable for monitoring wide changes in population density. The Multi-Pher and Uni-trap are therefore recommended for monitoring population changes of the spruce budworm, establishing thresholds for management action, and estimating population density.

TI  - EUROPEAN CORN BORER OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS LEPIDOPTERA PYRALIDAE YIELD LOSSES AND DAMAGE IN POPCORN IN RELATION TO HYBRID AND STAGE OF PLANT DEVELOPMENT
AB  - During a 2-year period, two popcorn hybrids (Iopop 12 and Indiana AES experimental hybrid 8365) were infested with European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), egg masses at five plant-growth stages (mid-whorl, late whorl, tassel emergence, anthesis, and 14 days after anthesis). Six levels of infestations were used (none, natural, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 eggs masses per plant). Considerable yield loss occurred in Iopop 12 from as few as 0.5 egg masses per plant at all plant-growth stages. Yield losses in hybrid 8365 were significant but less than in Iopop 12. Yield potential of Iopop 12 was greater than that of hybrid 8365, but potential yield losses and damage from ECB infestation were also greater. ECB infestation had no effect on popping expansion of either hybrid.

TI  - THE TEAK DEFOLIATOR HYBLAEA-PUERA DEFOLIATION DYNAMICS AND EVIDENCES FOR SHORT-RANGE MIGRATION OF MOTHS
AB  - In teak plantation at Nilambur, Kerala [India], Hyblaea puera Cramer (Lipidoptera, Hyblaeidae) caused one or two waves of epidemic defoliations between late April and July, followed in some years by isolated, lighter defoliation between August and November. The insect was absent at other periods, although with a 3-week life cycle it can theoretically pass through several generations per year. The temporal and spatial distribution of infestation and certain behavioural characteristics of populations gave evidence of short-range migration of newly emerged moths. In a model proposed for population dynamics of H. puera, no diapause occurs and a residual, non-migratory population exists in natural forests during the nonepidemic period. With the onset of general flushing of teak in February-March, the population starts building up and when a critical density is reached, migratory behaviour is triggered. Migration facilitates exploitation of new food sources and escape from larval parasites. Generally, after one or two epidemics, the population declines due to leaf maturity, natural enemies and density-dependent food depletion. This cycle of ups and downs, with attendant transition between migratory and non-migratory phases is repeated every year. If some steps of the proposed model are confirmed by further study, simple methods could be devised to manage this serious pest of teak.

TI  - ASSESSING PROBABILITY OF INTERACTION IN SIZE-STRUCTURED POPULATIONS DEPRESSARIA-MULTIFIDAE ATTACK ON LOMATIUM-GRAYI
AB  - Hypotheses on the direction of evolution in interspecific interactions generally rely upon the probability of interaction between the species. Attack by Depressaria multifidae (Lepidoptera, Oecophoridae) on tagged individuals of the perennial herb Lomatium grayi (Umbelliferae) was studied for five (Smoot Hill population) or three (Little Tucannnon population) years to analyze how plant demographic characteristics affect the probability that a plant is attacked at least once in its lifetime. The plant populations and the pattern of attack by the moths were analyzed based upon a model of size-specific demographic characteristics. Both plant populations were in steppe in eastern Washington, but plants at Smoot Hill had a higher probability of flowering each year within the larger size classes, spent fewer years in the largest size class, and had a lower probability of reaching the larger size classes than plants at Little Tucannon. The populations were similar however in the probability of attack each year within each size class. The probability that an established plant was attacked at least once in its lifetime was 0.12-0.17 at Smoot Hill and 0.30-0.55 at Little Tucannon. The results suggest that small to moderate differences in plant demographic characteristics can have large effects on the probability that a plant will be attacked at least once during its lifetime by a particular herbivore species; that is, small shifts in demographic characteristics can have large effects on "apparency" (sensu Feeny). The evolution of interactions between species may occur through slight shifts in life histories as often as it occurs through shifts in chemistry and morphology. The model developed here is applicable to other interactions involving size-structured populations and is a measure of probability of interaction that is useful in assessing how shifts in life histories and demographic variables can affect interactions between species.

TI  - MICROLEPIDOPTERA SPECIES COMPOSITION IN MICHIGAN USA APPLE ORCHARDS
AB  - Over 36 species of foliage-feeding Microlepidoptera and 13 species of Macrolepidoptera were found during 2 years of sampling in 17 southern Michigan apple orchards. Most of these were in the family Tortricidae. Among the most abundant and widely distributed species, especially in abandoned orchards, were the tortricids Pseudexentera mali Freeman, Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermuller), and Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris). The choreutid Choreutis pariana (Clerck) was abundant in some abandoned orchards, but was virtually absent from commercial orchards. The species sampled in commercial orchards tended to be those that were most widely distributed and abundant in abandoned orchards. Microlepidoptera found in commercial orchards were a subsample of the species in abandoned orchards. Thus, an understanding of the factors that control Microlepidoptera distribution and abundance in abandoned orchards, along with information on responses to pesticides, will help predict future species trends in commercial orchards.

TI  - MONITORING PINK BOLLWORM LEPIDOPTERA GELECHIIDAE POPULATIONS USING THE GENETIC MARKER SOOTY
AB  - The use of an autosomal dominant body color mutation, sooty, of the pink bollworm [Pectinophora gossypiella] was used in the evaluation of changes in insect population densities. Sooty males were released in 1 cotton field, and sooty females were released in another field. Population densities were measured during the release and in the F1 generation by pheromone trap captures and by larval samples from boll collections. Sooty male migration was recorded in fields surrounding 3 sides of the male release field. Developmental times observed in the field were compared with results from a computer program which used daily maximal-minimal temperatures to derive developmental rates. Sooty adults of both sexes mated with feral adults. Trap captures indicated that sooty males migrated out of the release field in directions that were predicted by the prevailing winds. Generation times ranged from 22-25 days. The proportion of F1 sooty males (compared with feral males) captured in the field where males were released was a good indicator of the proportion of sooty males which could be recovered in boll collections. Predictions of adult F1 populations and larval F1 populations were closely related.

AB  - The relative abundance of P. blancardella (F.) and P. crataegella (Clemens) was examined on sprayed and unsprayed apple trees in Connecticut by identifying pupae collected from fallen leaves during the 3rd leafminer generation of 1980-1982. P. crataegella dominated at 8 of 9 sprayed sites. P. blancardella dominated at 7 of 8 unsprayed sites. The widespread occurrence of P. blancardella on apple trees and especially its dominance in 1 sprayed orchard contradicts published reports on its absence in Connecticut. Temporal and spatial variation in species composition at unsprayed sites is attributed partly to defoliation by the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), and to the proximity of potential colonists in commercial orchards. Dominance of P. crataegella in most commercial orchards is probably related to its resistance to insecticides. The cause of P. blancardella dominance at most unsprayed sites is unknown.

TI  - OBSERVATIONS OF THE SPHINGIDAE LEPIDOPTERA OF TRINIDAD
AB  - Species records of Sphingidae taken in Trinidad were kept from 1968-1979. Species (75) and 1 subspecies were taken, including several new records for the island. The numbers of sphingids taken in Robinson light-traps equipped with 125-watt mercury-arc lamps were recorded over a period of 8 yr at St. Augustine, Trinidad, and the data analyzed. The species abundance distribution was well-fitted by the log-normal series. Data were examined for trends and periodicities, and the variance was largely accounted for by 3 principal factors. A long-term decline in catch was observed in 1 trap due to the growth of screening vegetation. Annual variation in catch correlated with the annual pattern of precipitation, with higher catches during the rainy season, although some species differences were detectable. Monthly variation in catch corresponded with the cycle of lunar illumination, being significantly depressed with increasing brightness. Interspecific differences in the response to moonlight were also detected. The influence of screening effects on the observed periodicities is discussed in relation to the siting of the traps. Times of commencement of flight activity were recorded, and the relationship between time of capture and activity is discussed. Apart from 1 species, the sex ratio of captured sphingids was significantly male-biased. Data from 3 traps were compared with each other and with those from other tropical locations.

TI  - POPULATION ECOLOGY OF THE LIGHT BROWN APPLE MOTH EPIPHYAS-POSTVITTANA LEPIDOPTERA TORTRICIDAE
AB  - The population ecology of the light brown apple moth, E. postvittana (Walker) (Tortricidae) was studied in Victoria [Australia] for 16 generations at one site and 9 generations at another between 1971 and 1977. Life-tables are given for the 2 populations. Key factor analyses were carried out using data from one site which provided information on 6 summer generations, 5 autumn-winter generations and 5 spring generations. Mortality of eggs was identified as the key factor in spring and autumn-winter generations with mortality of 1st instar larvae and of eggs as the key factors in the summer generation. These 2 stages therefore determine trends from one season to the next. Mortality of other stages, particularly of larval instars II-V was unimportant. MOrtality of instar VI and pupal stages ranked next to that of eggs and/or 1st instar larvae in key factor analyses. Predation by arthropods was identified as the key factor in determinations of sub-mortalities of the egg, instars II-V, instar VI and pupal stages. Other causes of mortality such as infertility, a Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus disease, and a complex of parasitoids of the egg, larvae and pupae were unimportant in determining population abundance, although some of these factors caused death of large numbers of individuals. Failure to attain maximum potential natality or losses in fecundity ranked next to predation as a key mortality factor of the egg stage. Only about 14-30% of the maximum egg-laying potentaial was achieved. Fecundity was dependent on the weather, quality and variety of food plants available and the succession of these plants. Summer generation moths laid fewer eggs for this reason, in contrast to those of autumn-winter and spring generations. Population fluctuations of the moth are determined by climate and food acting in a density-independent manner, and by egg and/or 1st instar larval predation acting in a density-independent manner. Exceptionally dry and warm seasons, such as the 1973 summer, can greatly accentuate the effects of weather, almost eliminating summer generations. Milne's concept of population regulation appears to hold well for E. postvittana.

TI  - TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF BLACK CUTWORMS AGROTIS-IPSILON AND DINGY CUTWORMS FELTIA-DUCENS IN MIDWEST USA FIELD CROPS
AB  - Larval populations of the black cutworm, A. ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and the dingy cutworm, F. ducens Walker (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were sampled in field crops in Missouri during the spring of 1978 and 1979. Dingy cutworms were captured in March, April and May, whereas black cutworms were present only in May and June. Aggregation indices indicated that both dingy and black cutworms were random (Poisson) in distribution. No significant correlations between the abundance of black cutworms and the density and cover of several weed species were detected.

AB  - Seasonal populations of the fall armyworm, S. frugiperda (J.E. Smith) and the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Huebner were surveyed during 1975-1977 at Gainesville, Sanford, Bradenton and Homestead, Florida. S. frugiperda was most abundant at Homestead during the spring and fall, and more numerous at the other locations during the summer and fall. A. gemmatalis larvae were present on soybeans at Homestead during all except 3 mo. of the study; populations peaked in the fall at all 4 sites.

TI  - SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISPERSION PATTERNS OF POLLINATORS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE FLOWERING STRATEGY OF YUCCA-WHIPPLEI AGAVACEAE
AB  - A field investigation of the mutualistic interaction between a monocarpic perennial plant, Y. whipplei, and its host-specific pollinator and seed predator, Tegeticula maculata (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae), was conducted to determine how the resource utilization pattern and population dynamics of the pollinator have influenced the evolution of the flowering and fruiting pattern of the plant. Although the temporal pattern of emergence of pollinators results in a relatively close tracking of flower abundance within a season, the ratio of pollinators to open flowers does vary significantly within a season, as well as between seasons. At any point in time during the flowering season, the population of adult yucca moths is distributed evenly among the available flowers, so that the number of pollinators on an inflorescence is directly proportional to the number of open flowers available. The relative isolation of individual flowering plants apears to have little effect on the distribution of pollinators among inflorescences. The number of fruits initiated on a plant is directly proportional to the number of flowers produced, and is also partially determined by the time of flowering. Y. whipplei always produces many more flowers than fruits. Most flowers are not fertilized, and the plants also generally abort and abscise immature fruits after flowering. Fruit production of at least some plants appeared limited by pollination. It is also expected that in some years the relative abundance of pollinators will be low enough that most plants will be pollinator-limited. The pattern of flowering and fruiting of this species has evolved in response to the unpredictability of pollinator availability, both within and between seasons. Resource uncertainty and selection acting on the male component of fitness may also be involved.

TI  - Density-related mortality in Cameraria hamadryadella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) at epidemic and endemic densities
AB  - To determine the role of natural enemies and host-plant quality in the population dynamics of Cameraria hamadryadella, we examined survival patterns and causes of mortality of a single population of C. hamadryadella during the epidemic years of 1982-1984 and the endemic years of 1988-1990. C. hamadryadella is a leaf-mining microlepidopteran whose primary host is white oak, Quercus alba. Populations of C. hamadryadella range in density over four orders of magnitude from endemic densities of 0.004 individuals per leaf to outbreak densities of 22.79 per leaf. In an epidemic year (1984), 53.5% of the individuals studied died because of "other causes" which we contend is a combination of host resistance and intraspecific competition. Parasitism and predation accounted for 21.2% and 24.7% of total mortality, respectively, and only 0.6% of the cohort survived. Survival was significantly greater in the endemic year (1990), and death by "other causes" was also 29.2% lower in the endemic year. The reduction in mortality due to other causes in the endemic year is due to lower rates of starvation, and to reduced intraspecific competition. However, mortality from starvation, parasitism, and predation did not differ between epidemic and endemic years indicating a lack of temporal density-dependence. During the epidemic, only mortality caused by host and intraspecific competition was spatially positively density-dependent on the scale of individual leaves. The overall impact of parasitoids was density-independent, and the effect of predators was significantly inversely density-dependent on the leaf scale. Our results suggest that natural enemies are not responsible for the decline in abundance of C. hamadryadella observed between 1984 and 1990. However, starvation possibly arising from host resistance and, secondarily, intraspecific competition could account for the observed population crash.

TI  - ARTHROPOD FAUNA OF JARRAH EUCALYPTUS-MARGINATA FOLIAGE IN MEDITERRANEAN FOREST WESTERN AUSTRALIA SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN ABUNDANCE BIOMASS GUILD STRUCTURE AND SPECIES COMPOSITION
AB  - A 2 year study (using a branch-clipping technique) of the arthropod fauna of jarrah crowns (14 m above ground level) in a 7500 km2 area centred on Manjimup, Western Australia, yielded 7461 individuals belonging to 396 species. Lepidoptera, Hemipter and Araneae dominated the fauna in abundance and biomass but Lepidoptera less so in number of species. Consequently, leaf chewers, sapsuckers and predators were the dominant guilds. Most species showed great spatial and temporal variation in their occurredce, with some 73% being recorded on only one or two of the nine sampling occasions. In addition 77% of species were recorded on four or fewer of the 45 trees sampled. Crowns of these trees tended to have highly dissimilar assemblages of arthropods. Dissimilarity beween trees was not predictable from the distance between them. Total species richness was greatest in sample scollected in summer. Predators and sapsuckers tended to be the most speciose guilds. Within-stand differences were much less pronounced than between-stand differences: ants were more abundant on jarrah foliage within 2 m of ground level and the pest defoliator Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) was more abundant on foliage of jarrah pole crowns 14 m above ground. The most abundant anthropods, U. lugens, did not reduce appreciably the biomass or abundance of other arthropod groups present in jarrah pole crowns. This is consistent with the paradigm that competition between species of herbivorous insects is infrequent. After comparison with other studies in jarrah forest, we tentatively conclude that there is no single fixed pattern of organization or predictable assemblage of invertebrates on jarrah foliage.

TI  - RESPONSE OF 4 LEAF-ROLLER SPECIES LEPIDOPTERA TORTRICIDAE TO SEX ATTRACTANTS IN BRITISH-COLUMBIA CANADA ORCHARDS
AB  - The sex pheromones of Archips argyrospilus (Walker) A. rosanus (L.), Choristoneura rosaceana Harris and Pandemis limitata Rob. were evaluated in [peach] orchards with the objective of developing a method of monitoring leafroller population densities. The sex pheromones were specific for 3 spp. but not for C. rosaceana. This leafroller was captured in traps containing A. rosanus sex pheromone more frequently than in traps with its own attractant. The trapping program indicated that C. rosaceana and P. limitata were abundant in the southern fruit growing region of British Columbia and that A. argyrospilus and A. rosanus were the predominant species in the northern region. The traps can be used to identify leafroller species in orchards and to indicate when moths are active, which may help in timing control measures.

TI  - INTERPOPULATION DIFFERENCES IN PUPAL SIZE AND FECUNDITY ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH OCCURRENCE OF OUTBREAKS IN EPIRRITA-AUTUMNATA LEPIDOPTERA GEOMETRIDAE
AB  - 1. Among-population differences in pupal mass were studied in a geometrid, Epirrita autumnata. Some Epirrita autumnata populations regularly reach outbreak densities while others are never known to do so. Because adults do not feed, pupal mass of females correlates strongly with fecundity. 2. Larvae were collected from twelve field sites. Ten of our sample populations originated within the outbreak range of the species and represented different phases of outbreaks. Two populations originated outside the outbreak range. 3. Pupal mass of field-collected E. autumnata varied significantly among populations. The peak phase populations had the smallest pupae and the biggest were found in low density populations outside the outbreak range. 4. Offspring of moths from each population were reared under identical conditions in two larval densities. Significant differences were not found in pupal mass among populations. That is, the inherent size, correlated with fecundity of moths, was not different between populations originating within and outside the outbreak range, nor among collections from different densities or phases of the outbreaks. 5. Rearing density did not interact in a consistent way with population. 6. As far as size and fecundity are concerned, the results do not support Chitty's hypothesis that differences in genetic composition of the population at low and high density phases generate cyclic fluctuations of population density. 7. Because no hereditary or maternal differences were found in size and fecundity between E. autumnata originating within and outside the outbreak range, variation in reproductive capacity cannot explain why outbreaks occur only in some populations.

TI  - Patterns of density dependence in moths and aphids
AB  - 1. The incidence of density dependence was examined in 5715 time-series of annual abundances of 447 species of moths and aphids in the UK using three techniques (Ricker equation, Bulmer's test and Pollard et al's test). 2. Delayed density dependence (lag 2 years) was not found more frequently than expected by chance. In the moth family Noctuidae, delayed density dependence was slightly but significantly more frequent in woodland populations than in non-woodland populations, consistent with a higher frequency of outbreak species among forest Lepidoptera. 3. The incidence of significant density dependence increased with the length of the time-series (from 10 to 24 years), and density dependence was detected more frquently in species which did not show a significant trend in abundance over time. 4. The incidence of density dependence was 79% and 88% in moth and aphid time-series which were longer than 20 years (Bulmer' test). 5. There were only slight differences between localities in the average degree of density dependence when the effect of time-series length and trend were removed. 6. Significant differences were found between species in the averge degree of density dependence, especially in noctuid moths and aphids. In noctuids, the average degree of density dependence increased with body size.

TI  - INVESTIGATIONS ON THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF THE EUROPEAN CORN BORER OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS HBN. LEP. PYRALIDAE IN BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG II. THE FLUCTUATIONS
AB  - The population density of Ostrinia nubilalis (ECB) was recorded during 1976-1990 in a semiquantitative way from 18-40 margins of maize fields in an area south from Stuttgart, called the "Filder Plain". Until the begin of the investigations, maize had not experienced severe borer damage in this area, but from 1978 onward ECB increased in numbers and damaged from 1983 to 1987 in parts of the area numerous maize fields. Thereafter, a decline started. The population dynamics of ECB followed a typical cyclic pattern. Meteorological data from a nearby station suggest a modificatory influence of spring and summer temperatures on the fluctuations, but this influence is not strong enough to interfere essentially with a general trend. The possible driving forces of the cycles are discussed but remain unknown. The fluctuation curves in the different subareas parallel each other to a fairly large extent but progress on completely different levels: In subareas in which a high proportion of maize was grown for grain production and harvested late in the season, ECB density was about 10fold of the density in those subareas in which almost all maize was harvested early and used for cattle fodder or ensilage. Time of harvest, therefore, seems to be an essential factor in determining the level of ECB attack. The data indicate that a proportion of 20% grain maize or CCM in an area might be sufficient to keep up a fairly dense ECB population. It is concluded that the increase of ECB density during the first part of the investigation period has been caused by some changes in maize production and use.

TI  - Phenology, monitoring, and control decision components of the grape berry moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) risk assessment program in New York
AB  - The average date and degree-day accumulation of peak egg deposition for each generation of grape berry moth, Endopiza viteana Clemens, during 1987 and 1988 are presented. Three generations were observed in 1987 but only two generations were observed in 1988. Egg deposition in 1988 was delayed on both a calender and degree-day basis. Pheromone trap catch was an effective predictor of the temporal occurrence of grape berry moth egg deposition but was a poor indicator of the level or spatial distribution of larval damage. Action thresholds for initiating insecticide treatments of second-generation grape berry moth based on estimating population density during the 3rd wk in July were 17 and 3% damaged clusters for early- and late-harvested varieties, respectively. The operating characteristics of the currently recommended sampling procedure, consisting of two vineyard sites and 50 grape clusters inspected per site, was compared with a calculated optimal procedure. The optimal procedure required the same amount of sampling time as the currently recommended procedure and consisted of sampling five sites and 15 clusters per site. The optimal procedure performed better, but the difference between the two procedures was small. The results are discussed in the context of a risk-assessment approach for the management of the grape berry moth in New York State.

TI  - WING SIZE VARIATION IN EPIRRITA-AUTUMNATA LEP. GEOMETRIDAE IN RELATION TO LARVAL DENSITY
AB  - The purpose of the study was to assess the importance of possible genetic differences in relative wing size, measured in terms of wing loading, in population dynamics of Epirrita autumnata, as well as to test whether experimental crowding during larval stage triggers changes in wing loading. Larvae were collected from the field within and outside the outbreak range. Samples within the outbreak range originated from populations representing different outbreak phases. There were significant differences in wing loading among populations in E. autumnata collected from the field as half-grown larvae, but not among F1-generation populations reared under identical conditions throughout the larval period. Thus no evidence of genetic differences was found in wing loading among individuals originating from different outbreak phases nor between samples originating within or outside the outbreak range. However, there were significant differences among broods within populations. Experimental crowding did not affect wing loading differently in study populations. In crowded males wing size decreased more rapidly than body mass, which cannot be considered beneficial for dispersal, but may be associated with a trade-off between wing size and reproductive success.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF THE ORIENTAL MOTH MONEMA-FLAVESCENS LEPIDOPTERA LIMACODIDAE
AB  - The comparative analysis of life tables of the oriental moth, Monema flavescens, obtained in 6 patches for 8 generations in 4 years revealed the following: The ratio of maximum to minimum of cocoon density for each patch ranged from 5.34 to 22.50, each value being more than 3.20, the ratio for the whole study area. The density change from adult to cocoon in the next generation caused most of the spatial variation in density change per patch. The rate of adult-to-cocoon population change showed spatial density dependence in some generations but not in others. When the change rate lacked spatial density dependence, it was the key-factor for spatial variation in adult density for the following few generations till the change rate recovered spatial density dependence. This was because of flooding, which killed the spatial density dependence existing potentially in the adult-to-cocoon change rate and damaged the same patches during the few successive generations. The rate of population change from overwintered generation adults (summer ones) to first generation cocoons was not only the key-factor for the rate of throughout-the-year change but temporally density dependent in each patch. Therefore, the density for the whole study area is considered to fluctuate within a range. However, the strong equilibrium seen in the cocoon density for the whole study area was due to the floods that happened to occur when the density was near and at its maximum, and it is considered that such a strong equilibrium does not always occur. In the population change from summer adults to first generation cocoons, temporal density dependence was found in all the patches, but it was found only in one patch in the population change from autumn adults to second generation cocoons. This was because the spatial density dependence seen in the former corresponded to the absolute density of adults, while that in the latter corresponded to the relative density.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF SUBLETHAL NEOGREGARINE INFECTIONS IN THE SPRUCE NEEDLEMINER EPINOTIA-TEDELLA LEPIDOPTERA TORTRICIDAE
AB  - A hitherto unknown factor causing cyclic reduction in population fertility of Epinotia tedella (Cl.) was identified as sublethal infections of the neogregarine Mattesia sp. Infection probably takes place when larvae enter hibernation, but does not develop into spore production until the formation of pupae and adult moths. At the individual level, the sublethal neogregarine infection causes a slight delay in adult emergence, a decreased adult lifespan, a suppression of egg development, and thus a reduction in fertility. At the population level, fertility reduction has a delayed density dependent component and, through correlation, Mattesia is assumed to be causative. Since fertility reduction is a key-factor in E. tedella, Mattesia may even be a dominant factor in the dynamics of this species. Mattesia infections were found in no other dominant insect species at the locations, and consequently the interaction between E. tedella and Mattesia sp. seems to be specific. Such delayed density dependent interaction can create host oscillations, as seen in many forest insects. However, host-parasitoid interaction alone leads to oscillations with the observed period of 6-8 years length, and the neogregarine infections apparently act in parallel with the parasitoids and enhance the amplitude of the oscillations.

TI  - ROLE OF THE FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE PHEROMONE AND OTHER FACTORS IN THE CAPTURE OF BUMBLEBEES HYMENOPTERA APIDAE BY UNIVERSAL MOTH TRAPS
AB  - The International Pheromone Systems Universal moth trap (Unitrap), when baited with the pheromone of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), has intermittently been observed to capture large numbers of bumblebees in addition to fall armyworm males. Studies were undertaken in Graham County, N.C., in 1988 and 1989 to determine the contributing factors. Investigation revealed that the yellow color of the traps was attractive to bumblebees, but the color alone did not influence their subsequent movement into the trap and resulting capture. Fall armyworm pheromone alone, particularly when used in combination with a No-Pest resin strip containing dichlorovos insecticide (to kill trapped insects), significantly increased the catpure of bumblebees in yellow Unitraps. The green Unitrap alone was totally unattractive to bumblebees Unitraps captured the greatest number of bumblebees when positioned adjacent to, and at the same height as, pollinating corn tassels. The number of captured bumblebees declined progressively as Unitrap height was lowered at 1-meter intervals from 4 to 1 m. Eleven species of bumblebees were identified from Unitrap captures. Abundant early spring rainfall in 1989 appeared to be primarily responsible for substantial reductions in the number of ground-nesting species of bumblebees during the summer.

TI  - MONITORING SEASONAL POPULATION FLUCTUATION OF SPOTTED AND SPINY BOLLWORMS BY SYNTHETIC SEX PHEROMONES AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS TO BOLL INFESTATION IN COTTON
AB  - Experiments were conducted to monitor the seasonal population fluctuation of spotted bollworm, Earias vittella (F.) and spiny bollworm, E. insulana (Boisd.) (Lep., Noctuidae) by synthetic sex pheromone traps and relationship between moth catches and larval infestation in bolls of cotton. The traps were baited with 1 mg of sex pheromone (10E,12E)-10,12-hexadecadienal; and 10:2 mixture of (10E,12E)-10,12-hexadecadienal and (Z)-11-hexadecenal for spiny and spotted bollworms respectively. The daily catches of spotted and spiny bollworm moths were variable, however, average catches per night were positively correlated with the larval infestation in cotton bolls. Average nightly number of moths captured in pheromone baited traps were also positively correlated with the number of larvae per plant. The larval population in the fruiting bodies of cotton and the moth counts in pheromone traps increased with the developmental stages of the crop. The peak moth population and larval infestation of spotted and spiny bollworms was observed in the months of August and October respectively. Results indicated that a mean trap catches of 9-12 moths per night of spotted bollworm was associated with economic injury level of infestation. Although, a maximum of 12 moths per trap per night in the month of October were captured in case of spiny bollworm but the infestation remained below economic threshold i.e. 10% damage.

TI  - PREDICTING LESSER CORNSTALK BORER LEPIDOPTERA PYRALIDAE LARVAL DENSITY FROM ESTIMATES OF ADULT ABUNDANCE IN PEANUT FIELDS
AB  - The abundance of larvae and adults of the lesser cornstalk borer [Elasmopalpus lignosellus] was monitored in conventionally tilled and planted Florunner peanuts at the Wiregrass Experiment Substation in Headland, Ala. [Alabama, USA] from 1984 to 1986. Larval abundance was monitored by soil sieving ca. weekly throughout the growing season. The abundance of adults was monitored weekly by flushing male and female moths from rows by beating plants with a stick. Regression was used to determine if adults in week 'i' can explain the variation in larval abundance in week 'i' + 1', over the three years of observation. The mean number of larvae from week 'i + 1' increased linearly with an increase in adult flush counts from week 'i' (P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.91), indicating that larval density could be predicted by adult abundance. The resulting equation had an intercept that was not significantly different from zero (P = 0.29) and a slope of 12.66 .+-. 0.88 (P < 0.0001), indicating that about 13 larvae/meter can be expected to be found one week later for each adult/meter flushed. Observations from five separate peanut fields were taken in 1990 to determine if adult counts do reflect larval abundance as predicted by the regression equation. Means from four of five model validation fields fell within the 95.% confidence limits for the regression equation, indicating excellent agreement with the field data. This equation could be a significant addition to management of the lesser cornstalk borer, because the use of adult flush counts allows for the prediction of damaging and difficult to sample larval populations before they occur.

AB  - Dispersal distance traveled by male Spodoptera litura and its seasonal change from May to September were estimated by releasing marked males and later recapturing them with sex pheromone traps. Mean flight distance was estimated to be 3.5-5.9 km the first night after release and 3.0-10.9 km for the total experiment period. Length of mean survival period after release was 1.5-6.0 days. Maximum dispersal distance was observed in May, when both the mean flight distance for the first night and the length of survival period were the longest. The dispersal distance decreased during summer. Shorter flight distance and lower survival rate were recorded during this period, a probable result of higher temperatures.

TI  - RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPRUCE BUDWORM LEPIDOPTERA TORTRICIDAE EGG MASS DENSITY AND RESULTANT DEFOLIATION OF BALSAM FIR AND WHITE SPRUCE
AB  - Annual spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens), survey data were subjected to multiple and logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between egg mass density in the fall and resultant defoliation the next season. Egg mass density was the most important variable associated with resultant defoliation, followed by current defoliation, regional population trends, host species, and sprays. Together, these accounted for 60% of the variation in resultant defoliation. Balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Miller] suffered greater levels of defoliation than while spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] at a given egg mass density. Resultant defoliation of balsam fir also showed a steeper response to egg mass density than resultant defoliation of white spruce. Levels of current defoliation increased susceptibility to defoliation in a similar manner between species, as did regional population trends. Sprays were more effective at reducing resultant defoliation on balsam fir than on white spruce but, overall, did not confer a high level of foliage protection. Predictions of resultant defoliation using the multiple regression models had confidence limits averaging 75%, which are too large to be useful for predictive purposes. The logistic regression equations could be used to predict the probability of a stand receiving light or severe defoliation.

TI  - LIFE HISTORIES FLIGHT PATTERNS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF NINE CUTWORMS LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE IN MANITOBA CANADA
AB  - Six of the nine most common indigenous species of noctuid moths caught in a light trap at Glenlea, Man., over an 11-year period were univoltine and three were typically bivoltine but sometimes trivoltine. For the univoltine species, the day of peak catch and the day of 50% catch differed only by 3 days or less during 11 years. The timing of flight periods of Feltia jaculifera (Gn.), F. herilis (Grt.), Agrotis venerabilis Wlk., and Nephelodes minians Gn. were not influenced by the degree-days above 10.degree. C and the standard deviation of the date of 50% catch for these species was within 5-6 days. The date of 50% catch was more variable for Crymodes devastator (Brace) and Euxoa ochrogaster (Gn.), and the variation for the latter was partly explained by a relationship between flight dates and accumulated degree-days above 10.degree. C. For the multivoltine species, Pseudaletia unipuncta (Haw.), Discestra trifolii (Hufn.), and Xestia adela Franc., the day of peak catch for two generations also varied little from the day of 50% catch for each generation, but the day on which peaks occurred varied from year to year. Only for the first generation of D. trifolii was the day of 50% catch correlated with accumulated degree-days over 10.degree. C. Moth numbers for each species were not necessarily high when there were reports of crop damage by their respective larvae. There was no correlation between catches of moths in the first and second generation of multivoltine species, and there were no patterns of population trends among any of the economically important species. The life history, feeding habits, and economic importance of each species are discussed.

TI  - PHENOLOGY AND INFESTATION LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN CORN BORER OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA PYRALIDAE IN SOUTHERN MANITOBA CANADA
AB  - Studies were conducted from 1985 to 1988 in commercial corn fields distributed throughout the main corn growing areas of Manitoba to determine the distribution, phenology, and the level of infestation of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner). Pheromone and blacklight traps were used to monitor the flight activity of European corn borer throughout the flight period. The level of European corn borer infestation was determined by sampling for egg masses, hatched egg masses, plants with egg masses, plants with shot holes, larvae, and stalk breakage. Results indicated that the European corn borer infestation occurred throughout the corn growing areas of Manitoba and that the population has declined from 1985 through 1988. Significant positive correlations existed among the number of egg masses, plants with egg masses, plants with shot holes, larvae per plant, and plants with broken stalks. Peak capture of moths in pheromone traps occurred well after peak oviposition, and 10-14 days after the peak blacklight trap capture. Blacklight trap catch, but not the pheromone trap catch, was positively correlated with egg mass density. Both blacklight and pheromone traps were equally efficient in determining the onset and the duration of European corn borer flight, although for initiating surveys of egg masses and shot hole damage, pheromone traps are recommended. In Manitoba, corn growers apply pesticides well before the recommended damage threshold is reached.

TI  - DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VARIABLE PLANT PHENOLOGY AND ITS ROLE IN COMPETITION BETWEEN TWO INSECT HERBIVORES ON OAK
AB  - The population dynamics of Tortix viridana L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and Operophtera brumata L. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) on the pedunculate oak Quercus robur L. are driven by the degree to which larval hatch coincides with oak budburst in spring. Experiments with first instar larvae demonstrate that T. viridana has a much narrower dietary breadth, is less inclined to disperse from closed oak buds, and can resist starvation for longer periods than the polyphagous O. brumata. As a result of its specialist foraging strategy, T. viridana may be less susceptible to mortality associated with colonization of oak in spring than O. brumata. This may explain why T. viridana populations are, on average, higher. These results are discussed in the light of previous work which described the competitive advantage of O. brumata in field cage experiments. Stochastic mortality factors, which drive population change in both species independently of competition, favour T. viridana larvae, and over-ride the competitive superiority of O. brumata.

TI  - TEMPORAL OCCURRENCE OF THE VARIEGATED CUTWORM LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE ADULTS IN IOWA USA WITH EVIDENCE FOR MIGRATION
AB  - Adult activity and ovarian dynamics of the variegated cutworm, Peridroma saucia (Hubner), were studied during 3 yr by using blacklight traps. Initial mating in females coincided with ovarian development, with females continuing to mate up to six times during their lives. Adult catches, ovarian dynamics, and degree-day calculations indicated that P. saucia has three generations each year in Iowa. Very few preovipositional females were collected during the spring flight. This observation and the strong association of adult activity during the spring with weather patterns resulting in southerly winds suggested that P. saucia adults migrate into the state each spring when weather conditions are favorable. Flights during June through November contained a large portion of preovipositional females. Degree-day calculations also revealed that adults collected during June and July were the progeny of spring migrants, but temporally distinct influxes of migrants may produce distinct peaks of adult activity during June and July. Degree-day calculations and the collection of a few preovipositional females during the spring suggested that P. saucia may overwinter as pupae, which may produce adults that contribute to the influx of migrants in the spring.

TI  - BIOLOGY AND SEASONAL OCCURRENCE OF MANDUCA-QUINQUEMACULATA AND MANDUCA-SEXTA LEPIDOPTERA SPHINGIDAE IN SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN USA
AB  - The seasonal occurrence and development of field populations of Manduca quinquemaculata (L.) and Manduca sexta (Haworth) were monitored at the Kellogg Biological Station in Barry County, Mich., from late June to early September during 1985 and 1986. Results indicated that initial and peak oviposition were variable between years for both species and were not predictable by accumulated degree-days (DD), base 10.degree. C. In both years, initial egg deposition occurred slightly earlier for M. quinquemaculata than for M. sexta (DD 615 versus DD 728 in 1985 and DD 700 versus DD 742 in 1986), whereas peak oviposition was dependent upon the year in question. In 1985, oviposition for M. quinquemaculata peaked approximately 100 DD earlier than for M. sexta. In 1986, the reverse was observed. Larval development occurred at the same rate in both species and was closely associated with degree-day accumulation requiring, on the average, 39 DD per stadium. Monitoring data from both years indicated that M. quinquemaculata is likely univoltine in Michigan whereas M. sexta is probably bivoltine.

TI  - FLUCTUATIONS IN ABUNDANCE OF A STEM-BORING MOTH DAMAGING SHOOTS OF PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF OVEREXPLOITATION OF FOOD IN A LATE-SUCCESSIONAL GRASS MONOCULTURE
AB  - (1) Flush-crash cycles of the monophagous and univoltine moth Archanara geminipuncta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), which greatly damages the silicate-rich shoots of common reed Phragmites australis, showed a non-equilibrium nature of population fluctuations in this late-successional, apparent, and undisturbed grass monoculture. The striking similarities to pest outbreaks in crops (early successional plants in man-made pure stands) are discussed. (2) The caterpillars need thick shoots for stem-boring and pupation, so only reed growing in wet habitats (with thick shoots) showed outbreaks (up to 96% of the shoots damaged), while reed in dry habitats (with thin shoots) supported only small populations. Thick shoots contained more silicate, minerals and nitrogen than thin shoots. Contrary to expectations, not only wet reed, but also dry reed had a high coefficient of variation of moth abundance between habitats and years. (3) Caterpillar survival was positively correlated with the mean shoot diameter (= availability of suitable shoots) and negatively correlated with the number of damaged shoots (= caterpillar abundance and intensity of intraspecific competition). In a multiple regression, these easily measurable shoot characters explained 82% or 65% of the variance. Caterpillars need only two to three shoots before pupation, but even in wet reed, the ratio of damaged shoots to pupae could be as high as 25. (4) Neither chemical plant defences nor predation prevented outbreaks, and population dynamics could not be explained by these factors. Population collapse appeared to be due to the overexploitation of food resources (when caterpillars damaged nearly all thick reed shoots) with a subsequent scramble competition resulting in caterpillars starving to death. (5) Caterpillar damage induced the production of narrow side shoots. The number of side shoots per damaged stem was positively correlated with average damage level in the stand, and this indicated that the response of reed to damage depended on properties of the clone (due to the high physiological integration) and habitat (light-induction of dormant buds due to the thinned canopy), but not properties of the ramet. Reed responses were conflicting or suboptimal in that regrowth tissue (side shoots) not only rebuilt assimilation and competition ability, but also increased plant susceptibility to gall makers.

TI  - INSECT PESTS OF PEARL MILLET IN SAHELIAN WEST AFRICA II. RAGHUVA-ALBIPUNCTELLA DE JOANNIS NOCTUIDAE LEPIDOPTERA DISTRIBUTION POPULATION DYNAMICS AND ASSESSMENT OF CROP DAMAGE
AB  - Pest surveys in farmers' fields were conducted for Raghuva albipunctella infestations on pearl millet in Burkina Faso, Niger and northern Nigeria in 1980-1983. Field studies on the seasonal fluctuations of moths and diapausing pupae, assessment of crop damage of grain yield loss were conducted in Niger. The results indicated that R. albipunctella occurred between latitudes 11.degree. N and 15.degree. N, within the Southern Sahel and Sudan bioclimatic zones. R. albipunctella is a univoltine species, and off-season carryover is through diapausing pupae in the soil. The majority of diapausing pupae (51%) were found at 10-20 cm of soil depth. The onset and continuity of rains, favourable soil moisture and temperature conditions were key factors in diapause termination, duration of post-diapause development and adult emergence. Crop damage and grain yield loss were a function of sowing date, time of panicle exsertion and the occurrence of critical numbers of adult moths. Percentage crop lost varied from 1% to 41% with a mean of 20%.

AB  - Seasonal occurrence of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) was monitored by traps baited with gossyplure. Moths were caught during the crop and non-crop periods and mean daily catches were 2-185 and 9-27 moths per trap respectively. Catches, where pest management operated, rose to 48, and to 185 where it did not. Infestation of bolls under sprayed and unsprayed conditions was estimated to be 2% and 34% respectively. The effect of pink bollworm damage on the number of pickable bolls at harvest was also estimated.

TI  - CONTROL OF THE BEET ARMYWORM SPODOPTERA-EXIGUA HUEBNER LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE USING SYNTHETIC SEX PHEROMONE I. EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION DISRUPTION IN WELSH ONION FIELDS UK
AB  - The feasibility of synthetic sex pheromone as a communication disruption agent for the control of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, was examined by dispensing a 7:3 mixture of (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate and (Z)-9-tetradecen-1-ol into a 155 ha field containing scattered Welsh onion, Allium fistulosum L., plots (total area: 24 ha). Attraction of male moths to sex pheromone traps in the treated area was completely inhibited throughout the period of the treatment. Densities of egg masses and the 1st and 2nd instar larvae were reduced to 6% and 1%, respectively, relative to those in an untreated area about 9 km away. The maximum density of the 4th and 5th instar larvae was reduced to 4% of that in the untreated area. Consequently, crop damage was drastically reduced. In the treated area, the density of the larvae increased after the removal of the pheromone dispenser in mid-September, contrasting to a decrease of population density in the untreated area. These results showed the efficacy of synthetic sex pheromone in controlling field populations of S. exigua.

TI  - POPULATION DYNAMICS OF THE SUGARCANE BORER ELDANA-SACCHARINA WALKER LEPIDOPTERA PYRALIDAE IN NATAL SOUTH AFRICA
AB  - Infestations of the sugarcane pest Eldana saccharina Walker have been consistently serious in one part of the cane-growing belt of Natal, South Africa. Mortality in this region over seven years was estimated from moth catches in light traps, checked against population change measured from extensive larval counts, and plotted against climatic indices. The object was to construct a predictive model to illustrate mortality in other regions of the cane belt, to which infestations have spread in recent years. The spread southwards along the coast did not seem to have resulted from a decrease in natural mortality, but the spread to higher altitudes appeared to be due to lower mortality associated with warmer and drier years. The phenology of the insect and the effect of the annual harvesting cycle on phenology are discussed.

TI  - SPATIAL DYNAMICS AND SAMPLING OF LYONETIA-SPECULELLA LEPIDOPTERA LYONETIIDAE A LEAFMINER OF APPLE
AB  - The abundance of Lyonetia speculella Clemens larvae on each tree of a 1.25-ha apple orchard, planted in 1986, was determined monthly from June to September 1986 and May to September 1987. In both years, the abundance of L. speculella was low initially, increased in early summer, remained constant through midsummer, and increased again at the end of the summer. L. speculella abundance per tree was aggregated, but the distribution of infested trees was initially random, then regular for the remainder of each year. The initial increase in abundance was caused by an increase in the percentage of the trees infested and the late summer increase by an increase in aggregation on infested trees. There were differences in distribution of mines between 'Northern Spy' and 'Red Delicious' because of phenological and growth habit differences between the two cultivars. An application of oxamyl in 1986 temporarily altered the spatial distribution of L. speculella, increasing the aggregation and decreasing the percentage of the trees infested for the sampling following oxamyl application. A graph of the relationship between sample size and sampling precision is provided to estimate required sample size for future studies. Random, systematic, random cluster, and systematic cluster sampling designs were all equally effective in simulated sampling from the field data.

TI  - THE ROLE OF LOCAL NATURAL ENEMIES IN POPULATION DYNAMICS OF CHILO-PARTELLUS SWINH. PYRALIDAE UNDER SUBSISTENCE FARMING SYSTEMS IN KENYA
AB  - The present article is one of a series of papers in preparation in which an ecological approach to developing a sound biocontrol programme for cereal stem borers is proposed and outlined. The proposed approach involves detailed population estimation and analysis in relation to crop phenology to determine the role of local natural enemies, evaluation of biocontrol potential of promising biocontrol agents, developing mass rearing and release technology and monitoring the impact of the biocontrol programme. In the example used to illustrate the first step in such a programme, life table analysis of data from a 2-year study on Chilo partellus on maize and sorghum under subsistence agriculture in Western Kenya, showed local predators (and unidentified factors) to contribute up to 97.6% of generation mortality of the borer in the age interval from egg to early instar larva, while parasitoids and pathogens contributed less than 1% mortality in the various life stages. Hence, a programme involving conservation and augmentation of local predators and introduction of selected exotic parasitoids of this borer seems appropriate. This represents an attempt to apply life table analysis, taking into account plant phenology, in studying interacting populations under subsistence farming conditions.

TI  - SEASONAL CAPTURES OF BOLLWORM AND TOBACCO BUDWORM LEPIDOPTERA NOCTUIDAE MALES IN PHEROMONE-BAITED TRAPS IN LOUISIANA USA
AB  - Pheromone traps baited with synthetic sex lures of the bollworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie), and the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), were monitored over an eight-year period (1980-1987) in Louisiana. The total number of Heliothis spp. males captured in traps was observed to be highest during August and September. Seasonal totals indicated that the number of bollworms exceeded the number of tobacco budworms collected during each year of the study. Pheromone trap captures of tobacco budworms demonstrated a bimodal pattern of occurrence with peaks during June and September. The number of tobacco budworm males collected for August and September represented a greater percentage of the total Heliothis spp. population than was observed earlier in the season. These data also indicate that the seasonal abundance of the tobacco budworm has increased during the period 1984-1987 which emphasizes the importance of early harvest in cotton production by decreasing the damage potential of both Heliothis spp. during September.

TI  - MOTH DIVERSITY OF A TROPICAL FOREST IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA
AB  - A standard Rothamsted light trap was operated for slightly over 12 months from the end of September 1979 to October 1980 at Genting Sempah, Pahang in Malaysia. All specimens of macrolepidoptera families together with the Pyralidae were identified, counted and recorded. The numbers of species caught were compared with those obtained by a different method at a nearby site for over 10 years. Diversity, biomass and seasonality of the catch were compared with identically sampled populations in Great Britain and New Zealand. The Genting Sempah trap had very high diversity and biomass compared with the temperate samples and exhibited much less seasonality. The Pyralidae and other families (excluding Noctuidae and Geometridae) formed a much higher component of diversity in Genting than in Britain. The log-normal distribution fits the data better than the log-series. So the inter-quartile slope, Q, is the correct parameter for interfaunal comparisons.

TI  - Biology and seasonal incidence of the jack shoot and fruit borer, Diaphania caesalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)
AB  - The biology and seasonal incidence of the shoot and fruit borer of jackfruit tree, Diaphania caesalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) has been studied. The male and female moths completed their life cycle in 30.4 +/- 2.3 and 31.8 +/- 2.3 days respectively with five larval instars. The mean incubation period of the egg, developmental duration of larva, prepupa and pupa were 4.9 +/- 0.6, 17 +/- 0.6, 3.6 +/- 0.4, 8 +/- 0.4 days respectively. The first and last instar larva measured 2.6 +/- 0.3 and 22.4 +/- 0.4 mm in length respectively. Unfed moths lived significantly shorter duration (6-9 days) than those with access to water (9-12 days), honey (12-14 days), and honey with vitamin supplement (14-17 days). The incidence of D. caesalis was recorded throughout the year during 2013-2016 indicated an overlapping of generations. However, two distinct peaks in the population level were recorded during June-July and October-November. Subsequently, the pest population declined at the beginning of the winter and was at a very low level in summer. Further, analysis of the data with population density and weather parameters revealed that relative humidity, minimum temperature and rainfall were positively correlated, whereas evaporation was negatively correlated with the incidence of D. caesalis.

TI  - Hurricane disturbance, plant-animal interactions, and the reproductive success of a tropical shrub
AB  - Hurricane disturbance may have strong effects on plant-animal interactions important in plant reproductive success. Components of reproductive success (flowering, pollination, seed predation) in the tropical shrub Ardisia escallonioides (Myrsinaceae) were examined from 1991-1994 in four southern Florida populations. Hurricane Andrew struck three of the four populations on 24 August 1992. Hurricane Andrew delayed flowering by two months in 1992. In 1993 and 1994, the three hurricane-damaged populations had increased flowering and inflorescence production compared to 1991 and 1992, while the undamaged population had no flowering. Hurricane disturbance had different effects on generalist versus specialist plant-animal interactions. Species composition and relative abundance of the generalist pollinator community that visits A. escallonioides was similar before and after the hurricane, indicating little effect of the disturbance on this interaction. In contrast, populations of a specialist flower galling moth (Periploca sp., Cosmopterigidae) declined in 1992 following Hurricane Andrew. Although moth populations increased at two of the three sites in 1993, the relative impact of moth predation on seed production was low due to extensive flower production. One moth population suffered local population extirpation for two years, reestablishing itself in November 1994. Hurricane disturbance resulted in a window of opportunity for massive seed production of Ardisia escallonioides in south Florida. Total seed production in 1993 increased twelve to seventy-three times the 1992 levels. Total seed production declined in 1994, but remained high compared to prehurricane levels.

TI  - The ecology of Oncopera fasciculata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae) in South Australia. IV. Fluctuations in numbers during 1948-1955 and an analysis of their causes
AB  - The development of the pastoral industry in County Grey has increased the numbers of O. fasciculata in the area. Even during unfavorable periods between outbreaks the numbers are greater than they used to be. Although the outbreak of 1948-50 was the greatest that has been recorded, not all of the suitable places were occupied during the outbreak, nor was all of the food eaten except in restricted areas. With food and shelter in excess of needs, the numbers reached during 1948-50 depended mainly on weather. Predators have very little influence on the numbers of O. fasciculata except when unfavorable wet weather forces larvae, prepupae, and pupae from their subterranean burrows. No parasites were found during this study. The evidence suggests that an increase in the numbers of O. fasciculata in any one generation may be expected when there are fewer than about 45 days without rain during the late egg and early larval stages (October-December) . Extensive damage to pastures may be expected when there is a series of such years; this has happened only once during the past 95 years (1947-49), and was followed by the outbreak of 1948-50. The numbers of O. fasciculata on the poorly drained soils are likely to increase whenever a dry, late winter (fewer than about 2 or 3 days of waterlogging during July-September) is followed by a wet, late spring. Changes in the distribution and abundance of O. fasciculata during 1948-55 are described and a probable explanation is put forward. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. abst

TI  - A study of the ecology of the adult bogong moth, Agrotis infusa (Boisd) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), with special reference to its behaviour during migration and aestivation
AB  - Observations were made during 3 summers on ecology and behavior of bogong moth. Agrotis infusa, which occurs in large assemblages at altitudes above about 4000 ft. in Australian Alps. Moths of spring generation migrate to mountains, where they aestivate gregariously in crevices and small caves in certain rock outcrops at or near mountain summits. Many of these moth "camps" are occupied annually from early Nov. until early April. In late summer and autumn, moths migrate back to breeding grounds. A small proportion of aestivating moths became intensely active for a period of about an hour just after sunset and just before sunrise each day, when they indulged in a random flight over outcrops. Activity appeared to be initiated by rapidly changing light intensity, and was accompanied by pigment migration in their eyes. Food was not sought when moths were active, although feeding response was sometimes elicited if they happened to settle on sugary food. Moisture from rain or dew was apparently ingested as required. Without exception aestivating moths had not copulated and their ovaries were immature. Their fat-body was well developed and a series of estimations during summer and autumn showed that avg. fat content of abdomens of males exceeded 61% and of females 51% of dry weight. Attacks by various predators on aestivating moths seemed unimportant, but a mermithid nematode caused some mortality when its larvae emerged from parasitized moths in midsummer. This parasite appeared to be confined to moth camps, where its life cycle has been adapted to aestivating habit of host. Mature larvae of A. infusa were collected during late winter and early spring of 1952 in pastures over a wide area of New South Wales. They were most abundant on heavy soils on Western Slopes and Plains and caused serious damage to linseed crops in n. of the State and in s. Queensland. Main areas of heavy, self-mulching soils, where large moth populations are believed to originate, have been broadly defined. Although A. infusa is a multivoltine sp., there is evidence that a facultative diapause occurs in adults of spring generation. This, together with migration, enables most of adult population to avoid breeding grounds during summer, when pastures are dominated by perennial grasses unpalatable to larvae. Same individuals return to breeding grounds in late summer and autumn, when dicotyledonous annuals upon which larvae feed have germinated. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ

TI  - Seasonality in the altitude-diversity pattern of Alpine moths
AB  - Altitudinal gradients are frequently used to study environmental effects on species diversity. Recent quantitative studies on Lepidoptera focussed on tropical mountain systems and often reported unimodal diversity peaks at "mid-elevations";, a pattern also often found in other taxa. Here we used methodologically comparable, nocturnal Macrolepidoptera samples from the Swiss Alps to analyze environmental correlates of diversity. Using seasonal data (monthly samples from April to November at altitudes between 600 and 2400 m a.s.l.) allowed to decouple altitude and some climate variables for analyses. We found that the altitude diversity pattern changes with season. In spring and autumn, diversity decreased with increasing altitude, while we found a unimodal peak of diversity at mid-elevations during summer. This excluded all hypothetical causes of diversity variation that do not allow for seasonality. Temperature was an important correlate of diversity, whereas precipitation was not. These results were separately corroborated for the two most common families (Noctuidae and Geometridae). However, diversity patterns of the two families were not particularly close, and unexplained variance of climatic explanations was substantial in all cases. The patterns of faunal overlap did not explain the unimodal diversity pattern, and we claim that we lack a generally valid explanation for this common phenomenon.

TI  - Pest-damage relationships for Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on vegetative soybean
AB  - The response of vegetative soybean (Glycine max) to Helicoverpa armigera feeding was studied in irrigated field cages over three years in eastern Australia to determine the relationship between larval density and yield loss, and to develop economic injury levels. Rather than using artificial defoliation techniques, plants were infested with either eggs or larvae of H. armigera, and larvae allowed to feed until death or pupation. Larvae were counted and sized regularly and infestation intensity was calculated in Helicoverpa injury equivalent (HIE) units, where 1 HIE was the consumption of one larva from the start of the infestation period to pupation. In the two experiments where yield loss occurred, the upper threshold for zero yield loss was 7.51 +/- 0.21 HIEs and 6.43 +/- 1.08 HIEs respectively. In the third experiment, infestation intensity was lower and no loss of seed yield was detected up to 7.0 HIEs. The rate of yield loss/HIE beyond the zero yield loss threshold varied between Experiments 1 and 2 (-9.44 +/- 0.80 g and -23.17 +/- 3.18 g, respectively). H. armigera infestation also affected plant height and various yield components (including pod and seed numbers and seeds/pod) but did not affect seed size in any experiment. Leaf area loss of plants averaged 841 and 1025 cm(2)/larva in the two experiments compared to 214 and 302 cm(2)/larva for cohort larvae feeding on detached leaves at the same time, making clear that artificial defoliation techniques are unsuitable for determining H. armigera economic injury levels on vegetative soybean. Analysis of canopy leaf area and pod profiles indicated that leaf and pod loss occurred from the top of the plant downwards. However, there was an increase in pod numbers closer to the ground at higher pest densities as the plant attempted to compensate for damage. Defoliation at the damage threshold was 18.6 and 28.0% in Experiments 1 and 2, indicating that yield loss from H. armigera feeding occurred at much lower levels of defoliation than previously indicated by artificial defoliation studies. Based on these results, the economic injury level for H. armigera on vegetative soybean is approximately 7.3 HIEs/row-metre in 91 cm rows or 8.0 HIEs/m(2). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pest-damage relationships for Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on soybean (Glycine max) and dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) during pod-fill
AB  - The response of soybean (Glycine max) and dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) to feeding by Helicoverpa armigera during the pod-fill stage was studied in irrigated field cages over three seasons to determine the relationship between larval density and yield loss, and to develop economic injury levels. H. armigera intensity was calculated in Helicoverpa injury equivalent (HIE) units, where 1 HIE was the consumption of one larva from the start of the infestation period to pupation. In the dry bean experiment, yield loss occurred at a rate 6.00 +/- 1.29 g/HIE while the rates of loss in the three soybean experiments were 4.39 +/- 0.96 g/HIE, 3.70 +/- 1.21 g/HIE and 2.12 +/- 0.71 g/HIE. These three slopes were not statistically different (P > 0.05) and the pooled estimate of the rate of yield loss was 3.21 +/- 0.55 g/HIE. The first soybean experiment also showed a split-line form of damage curve with a rate of yield loss of 26.27 +/- 2.92 g/HIE beyond 8.0 HIE and a rapid decline to zero yield. in dry bean, H. armigera feeding reduced total and undamaged pod numbers by 4.10 +/- 1.18 pods/HIE and 12.88 +/- 1.57 pods/HIE respectively, while undamaged seed numbers were reduced by 35.64 +/- 7.25 seeds/HIE. In soybean, total pod numbers were not affected by H. armigera infestation (out to 8.23 HIE in Experiment 1) but seed numbers (in Experiments I and 2) and the number of seeds/pod (in all experiments) were adversely affected. Seed size increased with increases in H. armigera density in two of the three soybean experiments, indicating plant compensatory responses to H. armigera feeding. Analysis of canopy pod profiles indicated that loss of pods occurred from the top of the plant downwards, but with an increase in pod numbers close to the ground at higher pest densities as the plant attempted to compensate for damage. Based on these results, the economic injury levels for H. armigera on dry bean and soybean are approximately 0.74 HIE and 2.31 HIE/m(2), respectively (0.67 and 2.1 HIE/row-m for 91 cm rows).

TI  - Changes of supercooling point and cold tolerance in diapausing pupae of sugar beet moth, Scrobipalpa ocellatella (Lepidoptera; Gelechiidae)
AB  - Sugar beet moth (SEM) Scrobipalpa ocellatella (Boyd) is one of the important pests of sugar beet that causes quantitative and qualitative yield loss late in the season. Pest damage is occurred in the central buds and the root of the sugar beet plant. The last instar larvae enter the soil and pupate for overwintering at harvest time of sugar beet in Karaj, Iran in November. The younger larvae having suitable habitat and enough food for development may have chance to pupate in soil gradually whenever weather permit. hi order to study the overwintering potential of the pest, pupae were collected monthly from November 2015 to April 2016. Seasonal changes in cold hardiness indices such as supercooling point and lower lethal temperature of the beet moth were studied. The mean supercooling points of field collected pupae varied from -13.2 +/- 0.33 to -18.2 +/- 0.23 degrees C. The highest cold hardiness of diapausing pupae was found in November, December and January, and the lowest in April. The cold hardiness of diapausing pupae was higher than that of nondiapausing pupae at -10, -15 and -20 degrees C. Lethal temperature for 50% of population (LT50) changed from -13.99 degrees C in November to -5.5 degrees C in April. In spite of the fact that the supercooling point of the diapause pupae did not exceed -15 degrees C in the late-winter and April, the pupae could not withstand temperatures below zero under a supercooling point. However, the findings show that the ability of pupae to tolerate in the diapause stage is more than the capacity of cold and frost environment, and therefore, temperatures below zero in winter cannot be considered as a significant risk for the survival of sugar beet moth.

TI  - Close congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (bins) and species boundaries in the Erebidae (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidea) of the Iberian Peninsula
AB  - The DNA barcode reference library for Lepidoptera holds much promise as a tool for taxonomic research and for providing the reliable identifications needed for conservation assessment programs. We gathered sequences for the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 160 of the 176 nominal species of Erebidae moths (Insecta: Lepidoptera) known from the Iberian Peninsula. These results arise from a research project which constructing a DNA barcode library for the insect species of Spain. New records for 271 specimens (122 species) are coupled with preexisting data for 38 species from the Iberian fauna. Mean interspecific distance was 12.1%, while the mean nearest neighbour divergence was 6.4%. All 160 species possessed diagnostic barcode sequences, but one pair of congeneric taxa (Eublemma rosea and Eublemma rietzi) were assigned to the same BIN. As well, intraspecific sequence divergences higher than 1.5% were detected in four species which likely represent species complexes. This study reinforces the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity in particular geographical areas and the strong correspondence between sequence clusters delineated by BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis.

TI  - Effect of landscape diversity and crop management on the control of the millet head miner, Heliocheilus albipunctella (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) by natural enemies
AB  - The pearl millet head miner, Heliocheilus albipunctella, is a major constraint to increasing crop productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of any insecticide application by farmers, its control mostly relies on the action of natural enemies.The objective of the present study is to identify crop management and landscape features affecting biocontrol services by natural enemies. A set of 45 millet fields were selected in a 20 * 20 km area in Senegal, from the analysis of high resolution satellite images (Pleiades), and hypotheses on relative abundance of millet fields and semi-natural habitats (mainly trees) in the agricultural landscape. A biocontrol service index (BSI) was computed for each field over two cropping seasons by experimentally excluding natural enemies from naturally egg-infested millet panicles. Information on crop management was collected through farmer's interviews. An information theoretical approach and model averaging were performed to rank the effect of landscape metrics on BSI at eight spatial scales (from 250 to 2000 m).The BSI was generally high (77%) but highly variable among fields (0-100%), and was greater in compound fields compared to bush fields. The BSI also increased with the abundance of tree patches and the diversity of vegetation in a 1750 m-buffer around millet fields.Results support previous studies stressing the importance of semi-natural areas and vegetation diversity to support pest regulation by natural enemies. Further research is needed to better understand relationships between agroforestry systems and biological control, to promote ecologically-intensive solutions for reducing crop losses.

TI  - Reduction in leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) abundance in orchards and vineyards 1976-2016, in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand
AB  - 1 Three leafroller species were monitored between 1976 and 2016 by bait and pheromone trapping for adults, larval damage to apples and timed searches on various hosts.2 Populations of all three species decreased substantially; however, the endemic Planotortrix octo and Ctenopseustis obliquana declined to a much greater extent than did the introduced Epiphyas postvittana.3 The two endemic species dominated in the 1970s, whereas they are now rarely found on fruit crops. Epiphyas postvittana has now become the principal leafroller species. 4 Leafrollers damaged over 20% of apples receiving no insecticides during the 1980s but, subsequent to 2000, damage has been below 2%. Between 1994-1999 and 2008-2011, the numbers of immature leafrollers in searches on fruit crop and noncrop hosts decreased by 55%.5 We attribute reduced leafroller populations to increased biological control and changes to insecticide programmes. Several parasitoids were introduced around 1980 and parasitism increased by 19% between 1994-1999 and 2008-2011. Replacing broad-spectrum insecticides with selective insecticides in the mid-1990s likely enhanced this trend.6 Leafrollers were formerly major pests, whereas their status has now changed to being minor pests. Today, they are uncommon on managed and unmanaged fruit crops and noncrop host plants on orchards and vineyards in Hawke's Bay.

TI  - Damage assessment of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in soybean reproductive stages
AB  - Quantification of damage by Helicoverpa armigera on soybean is a key factor in understanding the potential of this pest to cause losses in Brazil soybean fields and determining the timing of its control. The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify the damage of H. armigera at two reproductive stages of soybean in Brazil. Four experiments were conducted at two soybean phenological stages, full bloom (R2) and early grain filling (R5.1) over two years. A range of H. armigera larval densities up to 8 larvae m(-2) were infested on plants using third instar larvae for 15 days. Number of pods m(-2), seeds m(-2), seeds pod(-1) and seed yield were assessed in the upper, middle and lower third of soybean plants. H. armigera caused more injuries in the middle part of the plant, followed by the upper and lower third. The rate of seed-yield loss at the R2 growth stage was 7.7 g per larva, significantly lower than the rate of loss at the R5.1 stage (10.6 g per larva). At both crop growth stages, there were losses in total pod numbers and seeds/pod with increasing larval density, but sometimes with an initial period of compensation. The response of average seed weight to increasing infestation varied with plant growth stage, decreasing at the R2 stage, but increasing or not changing at R5.1. The results demonstrate that relatively low infestations of H. armigera can cause significant reductions for soybean in Brazil, and it is necessary to intensify monitoring and use of efficient and alternative control methods for the use of insecticide. In conclusion, our study shows that growth stage R5.1 is more sensitive to damage by H. armigera than the R2 stage. Further studies should be carried out to quantify the damage of H. armigera in the vegetative stage of the soybean crop in Brazil and also on determinate cultivars.

TI  - Resistance of transgenic rice events (rbcS:cry1Ac) against three lepidopteran rice pests
AB  - The transgenic rice expressing cry1Ac gene, which is linked to the rice rbcS promoter and its transit peptide sequence (tp), was highly resistant against all instars of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenetee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). In this study, we evaluated the larval mortality, behavior change, and field occurrence of three main rice pests, C. medinalis, Naranga aenescens (Moore) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Parnara guttata (Bremer & Grey) (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) in T4 generations of three Bt rice events (rbcS3:cry1Ac; 608102, 608104 and 608107) and non-Bt rice. All of the three Bt rice events were resistant to C. medinalis which showed significantly higher mortality for all instars compared to non-Bt rice. The resistance of Bt rice events against the larvae decreased gradually as the larvae developed. However, the survived larvae which ingested Bt rice events died eventually without further development. The resistance of three Bt rice events was investigated in the pot test, which was conducted with 3rd instars of C. medinalis, N. aenescens, and P. guttata, showed mortalities of over 70%. In behavioral assay, C. medinalis fed on the Bt rice events showed feeding avoidance and less leaf rolling behavior compared to that of the larvae fed on non-Bt rice. A 2-yr field survey conducted with larvae of C. medinalis and P. guttata also showed that the three Bt rice events significantly had lower damaged on leaves compared to that of non-Bt rice. Overall, the three Bt rice events were highly resistant to the larvae of lepidopteran target rice pests.

TI  - Effects of the Continuous Cropping of Soybean Plants on the Occurrence of Soybean Pod Borer, Leguminivora glycinivorella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
AB  - We investigated the number of Leguminivora glycinivorella (Matsumura) adults using a sex pheromone trap and the abundance of infested seeds in soybean fields in Niigata Prefecture. The examined fields were uplands converted from rice paddy fields and are almost continuously used for cultivating soybean. The investigation was initiated at 6 fields in 2011 and continued until 2015. However, fields converted to paddies were excluded from the observation, and new soybean fields were included. Fluctuations in the numbers of captured adults of L. glycinivorella were similar between the fields and years, that is, capturing of adults began in the middle of August and ended in the end of September, and the peak period was from the 6th pentad of August to the 2nd pentad of September. The total number of captured adults and the percentage of infested seeds differed between the fields and increased with the number of years of continuous cropping. A significant positive correlation was observed between the total number of captured adults and the percentage of infested seeds. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between the percentage of infested seeds in the previous year and the number of captured adults in the present year. These results suggest that the number of years of continuous soybean cropping and the percentage of infested seeds in the previous year could be used as parameters for forecasting the abundance of this pest.

TI  - Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hbner) in Posavje and Dolenjska region. / Problematika pojava juzne plodovrtke (Helicoverpa armigera Hbner) na obmoju Posavja in Dolenjske
AB  - In Slovenia the first appearance of Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hb.) was recorded in 1999. In the second half of August 2003 we noticed in the south-eastern part of Slovenia the first damage caused by polyphagous caterpillars. We used several different methods for monitoring and forecasting and we developed our own monitoring system. Monitoring was performed with pheromone traps, pyramid attracting lights and automatic light traps. The most complete results were acquired with the use of automatic light traps. With the use of collected data we established a critical moment for appropriate use of insecticides. Pheromone traps were used on three and automatic light traps on five different locations. Automatic light traps monitoring and pyramid attracting lights gave satisfactory data of moth flight. The damage which occurred was the biggest on tomato crops in greenhouses and lesser on crops of pepper fields. We determined that unripe tomatoes are more exposed to the attack of the bollworm than the ripe ones. Caterpillars drill into the unripe tomatoes and feed on epidermis of ripe ones. In the case of attacked peppers the damage can be mistaken with an European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hb.) which is momentarily causing damage on a big scale. The caterpillar is, because of its color and pattern changes, during the growth cycles easily mistaken with other noctuid caterpillars. During the research we also acquired the knowledge of the bionomy of the noctuid pest which will be useful in our future monitoring and forecasting.

TI  - Role of habitat management technologies in the control of cereal stem and cob borers in sub-Saharan Africa
AB  - Floral and faunal biodiversity is relevant to pest management in many ways. In the present paper, emphasis is given to the use of alternative wild and cultivated host plants as trap plants, mixed cropping and management of soil nutrients through mineral nutrition, and use of leguminous cover crops in crop rotation systems for integrated control of maize cob and stem borers in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings indicate that hydromorphic inland valleys (IVs) are reservoirs for borers and their natural enemies in upland maize fields. Populations of Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), the most important borer in Cameroon, were low in IV maize fields, increased and reached high levels during the first and second cropping season in adjacent upland maize fields, while egg parasitism of borers was 40% higher in the dry compared to the first rainy seasons, in IV and upland maize fields, respectively. Thus, IVs should be targeted for inundative releases in biological control programmes. Wild host plants, namely grasses, are highly attractive to ovipositing female moths. However, results from laboratory studies on the survival of immature stages of stem borer on different grass species showed that no Sesamia calamistis (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) and Eldana saccharina (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) larvae pupated on Pennisetum polystachion, indicating the role of wild hosts as trap plants in the vicinity of maize fields. Depending on the wild host plant and borer species, larval densities were reduced by 30-60% in maize fields surrounded by wild grasses. Consequently, up to two-fold higher levels of plant damage were recorded in maize without compared to maize with surrounding grasses. Depending on the crop association and planting pattern, intercropping maize with non-host plants reduced egg and larval densities of borers by 52.6-73.7% and 34.3-51.5%, respectively, compared to a maize monocrop. Consequently maize yield losses due to stem borers were up to two-fold lower in intercrops than in monocrops. All intercropping systems had the additional advantage of higher land productivity than the maize monocrop. A maize-cassava intercrop was most efficient in terms of land use, and thus recommendable for land-constrained poor farmers. Average densities of B. fusca at 42 days after planting were generally higher after maize-maize and additional nitrogen (N) fertilization of 60 or 120 kg/ha than after a short fallow of leguminous food or cover crops, and higher after legumes than after maize-maize without additional N doses. However, egg-larval mortalities were up to two-fold lower in maize-maize compared to legume-maize treatments. As a result, extent of dead-hearts did not vary significantly among treatments. The average yield losses due to borers were five times higher in the maize-maize sequence without additional N compared to both a legume-maize sequence and maize-maize and additional N dose treatments, suggesting that an increased nutritional status of the plant enhanced both borer fitness and plant vigour, but with a net-benefit for the plants.

TI  - Monitoring of plum fruit moth (Grapholita funebrana [Treitschke], Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) in extensive orchards in Slovenia. / Spremljanje zastopanosti epljevega zavijaca (Grapholita funebrana [Treitschke], Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) v ekstenzivnih sadovnjakih v Sloveniji
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to monitor the occurrence of the plum fruit moth (Grapholita funebrana) in Slovenia. In 2004, on six locations (Gabernik, Latkova vas, Dol near Hrastnik, Rakitnica, Zelimlje, Kromberk near Nova Gorica) pheromone traps were placed in extensive orchards. The aim of the research was to determine the number of generations it develops per year in climatically and geographically different regions. Based upon this monitoring (from the middle of April till the end of October) it can be concluded that the plum fruit moth has 3 generations per year only in the littoral part of Slovenia (Kromberk), while, in the continental part of the country it has 2 generation per year. In addition, bionomics of the pest, types of damage it causes and harmfulness of the moth are presented.

AB  - European corn borer is purposeful pest of corn catenarium. This pest developed different generation number as a function of its spread area. Object of my investigations was looked for explanation for mass propagation and increasing damage of corn borer. For a nationwide study of flight phenology and dynamics of European corn borer I acquired the national light trap results of three years (1999, 2000, 2001) from the Central Service for Plant Protection and Soil Conservation, Budapest. It contained the data of 45 places of survey from almost all counties of Hungary. I carried out corn borer larva investigation in South-East Hungary. I established ecology statements by means of climatic factors of previous years. Four different flight types of European corn borer were ascertained (generation quotient by Mszros 1st type=-; 2nd type ~ 0.1-0.6; 3rd type ~ 0.7-2; 4th type ~ 2-11). Tendency of moving of flight types are from southeastern to northwestern. The larval examination results confirmed the development of a second generation in South-East Hungary. Results of examinations can be proved influencing effect of climatic factors, and displacement of ecotypes can be explained with increasing average temperatures of years (average temperatures of year 9.6C in 1996; 11.3~C in 2002).

TI  - Effect of varietal diversity in olive groves on the population of leopard moth, Zeuzera pyrina L
AB  - The leopard moth, Z. pyrina, is a polyphagous pest attacking more than 70 shrub species belonging to over 30 botanical families including olive. It seriously attacks both young and old olive trees and presents continuously threat for olive farming on almost all olive growing areas in Egypt. The damage caused by the Z. pyrina larvae has already led to uprooting of many olive groves in Egypt. Infestation rates by Z. pyrina of a large olive farm (ca. 450 feddans) of young and fruitful olive trees (61 774 trees) of nine table olive cultivars were studied for two successive years (2002-03). The farm was divided into 88 uniform plots (5-7 feddans each). Each plot was surrounded by windbreak trees (Casuarina sp.) isolating each plot from the others. Each plot contained 2, 3 or 5 olive cultivars of total 780-900 trees per plot. All trees of 21 plots were carefully inspected at the peak period of adult emergence of leopard moth. The results suggest three categories of olive cultivars (1) susceptible (Toffahi, Hamedy and Sennara); (2) intermediate (Kalamata, Dolce, Becual and Manzanillo); and (3) resistant (Aks and Shamy). Interestingly, the co-existence of one olive cultivar may decrease or increase the rate of infestation by Z. pyrina larvae. The study may provide information about colonization of the leopard moth on specific olive cultivar in multiple cultivar cropping olive farm system. The present work suggests that using cultivar diversity of olive trees in olive groves is a good method for reducing crop losses due to leopard moths. Discovery of allomones in resistant cultivars, which drive away egg laying of Zeuzera females, may be fruitful in protecting the susceptible olive cultivars, i.e., olive farms from the leopard moth.

AB  - This study provides a detailed analyses of long-term (1962-1997) light trap data sets of winter moth (Operophtera brumata), in particular on the characterization of regional and country-wide population dynamics, the detection of synchrony level between fluctuation patterns, and the indication of aridity effects in the promotion of outbreaks. In the analyses, regional long-term time series of damages caused by geometrid moths were also used. In the statistical procedures, time series analytical methods were applied. Meanwhile, auto- and cross correlation functions were used for the detection of periodicity and synchrony of time series of light trap catches and damages. It was found that the light trap population fluctuations of winter moth were closely synchronized both in regional and country-wide spatial scale. Based on the light trap catches, a 9-year periodic fluctuation could be detected in the country-wide population dynamics of winter moth. The majority of peaks of winter moth derived from light trappings coincided with maximal values of time series of damages caused by geometrid moth assemblage. The long-term time series derived from light trappings of O. brumata can be used for prediction of outbreaks, because of the peaks of catches precede them frequently by one year. The outbreaks of winter moth are promoted by years with arid, droughty climate.

AB  - There are frequently extensive defoliations in Hungary - mainly in oak forests - caused by assemblage of geometrid moths. The dynamics of population and damages of most important winter (Operophtera brumata L., Erannis defoliaria Cl., Colotois pennaria Hbn., Agriopis aurantiaria Hbn.) and spring geometrid moth species during 1961-97 were studied. For the analyses the long-term data series were based on yearly captures of forestry light trap network and yearly samplings of area and scale of damages. By the time series analyses greater levels of synchrony were found between population dynamics of species within geometrid groups and between forest damage patterns of different regions. During the period studied, 4 outbreaks were detected (years of outbreak peaks 1962-63, 1972, 1983, 1993) in which the greatest damages were caused by winter geometrids, namely O. brumata and E. defoliaria. A tendency for 9-10 year long periodicity in fluctuation patterns of geometrids was indicated by the autocorrelation function analyses. Using aridity indices, a stronger relation was found between droughty years and development of outbreaks.

AB  - In a recent study the authors analyse statistically the long-term fluctuation patterns of the lackey moth (Malacosoma neustria). Time series analysis showed that the fluctuations of lackey moth were regionally synchronized. The maxima of light trap catches generally occurred 2-3 years earlier before the peaks of outbreak which phenomenon can be useful for forecasting of this pest. No significant periodicity in the fluctuation patterns was detected by the autocorrelation function, consequently the outbreak patterns of Malacosoma were aperiodic in each area investigated. The fluctuations of Malacosoma and Euproctis were regionally synchronized. The population increases and outbreaks of lackey moth was strongly promoted by droughty years.

TI  - Macrolepidoptera fauna of the Hungarian Great Plain based on forestry light trap catches between 1962-1996. / Az alfld nagylepkefaunja az erdszeti fnycsapdk adatai alapjn (1962-1996)
AB  - The authors listed 789 macrolepidopteran species of the Hungarian Great Plain based on collections of 9 forestry light trap stations between 1962 and 1996. The local species compositions of moth assemblages were influenced by the land use changes (e.g. agricultural intensification, dropping water table level caused by drainage and droughty climate), because of the decreasing area and increasing fragmentation of typical lowland forests. The relics of old-growth oak forests, serving as refuges for the original lowland moths, are seriously threatened by drying up. Whereas, the settlements of new forest stands (e.g. oak and pine) have promoted the remaining of assemblages and new moth species followed their food plant (Pinus spp.) in lowlands. As an example for this process a young (50-year-old), isolated oak forest stand is mentioned which have been already colonized by the typical moth fauna. Unexpected captures of numerous moth species supported evidences for greater distance flights (50-150 km) far from their habitats. The authors gave further examples for moth species migrating to northward and partly settled in lowlands, too (e.g. Noctua haywardy, Helicoverpa armigera, Heliothis peltigera, Celerio lineata [Hyles lineata] and Chersotis cuprea).

TI  - Forecasting Helicoverpa populations in Australia a comparison of regression based models and a bioclimatic based modelling approach
AB  - Long-term forecasts of pest pressure are central to the effective management of many agricultural insect pests. In the eastern cropping regions of Australia, serious infestations of Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) and H. armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) are experienced annually. Regression analyses of a long series of light-trap catches of adult moths were used to describe the seasonal dynamics of both species. The size of the spring generation in eastern cropping zones could be related to rainfall in putative source areas in inland Australia. Subsequent generations could be related to the abundance of various crops in agricultural areas, rainfall and the magnitude of the spring population peak. As rainfall figured prominently as a predictor variable, and can itself be predicted using the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), trap catches were also related to this variable. The geographic distribution of each species was modelled in relation to climate and CLIMEX was used to predict temporal variation in abundance at given putative source sites in inland Australia using historical meteorological data. These predictions were then correlated with subsequent pest abundance data in a major cropping region. The regression-based and bioclimatic-based approaches to predicting pest abundance are compared and their utility in predicting and interpreting pest dynamics are discussed.

TI  - Survey on the occurrence of Grapholita inopinata (Heinrich) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) at some areas in Aomori, Fukushima and Miyagi Prefectures
AB  - No infestation of apple fruit, Malus domestica [M. pumila], with Grapholita inopinata (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) has been reported in Japan for about 50 years since the first report in Fukushima Prefecture in 1953. As such, surveys on the occurrence of G. inopinata were carried out in Aomori, Fukushima, and Miyagi Prefectures (at sprayed apple orchards, non-sprayed or non-controlled apple orchards, and habitats of its wild hosts including M. toringo) from 2002 to 2003. As a result of a pheromone trap survey, using a sex pheromone for G. molesta for the first time, which has (Z)-8-dodecenyl acetate as the main component, a total of 54 males of G. inopinata were attracted over two years. There was a peak of adult flight in the latter half of August. Further, as a result of inspecting a total of 59 467 fruits (including 50 275 apples from sprayed orchards), two moths that emerged from fruits of M. toringo and M. prunifolia were identified as G. inopinata, but no moth from apples was identified as this species. From the result of this survey, it was found that the pheromone trap and survey of fruits, in the appropriate period, could be used to monitor G. inopinata in apple orchards to certify the pest-free places of production.

TI  - Population dynamics of Palpita unionalis (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in Central and Northern Greece
AB  - The jasmine moth, P. unionalis (Lepidoptera Pyralidae), was monitored in olive orchards by means of pheromone-baited funnel traps, in 2 regions of Greece, Magnissia (Thessaly, Central Greece) and Chalkidiki (Macedonia, Northern Greece). The pheromone of this species consists of 2 pheromone components, (E)-11-hexadecenal and (E)-11-hexadecenyl acetate. The traps were inspected for captured males at weekly intervals from July 2002 until March 2003. During summer and early autumn, adult numbers in traps were extremely low, usually less than one individual per trap. However, later in the trapping period (mid October-early November) captures were increased for both regions examined. Surprisingly, the highest numbers of males caught were noted during mid November and December, given that more than 70% of the total number of individuals captured was recorded during this interval. Despite the fact that during January and February captures were notably reduced, the traps continued to contain males even at low temperatures. This is the first quantitative study about the long-term monitoring of P. unionalis in olive orchards. The results showed that this species was active during the entire season of the monitoring, in varied densities, at least in the 2 regions examined.

TI  - Population establishment of the leafroller Eudemis gyrotis (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) at a new plantation of bayberry Myrica rubra (Myricaceae)
AB  - To clarify the immigration process of a phytophagous insect to a new habitat, I examined seasonal changes in the abundance and parasitism of larvae and pupae of a leafroller, Eudemis gyrotis (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), at both a new and an old plantation of the bayberry Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc. (Myricaceae) on Mt. Tanakami, Shiga Prefecture, central Japan, in 1999. E. gyrotis adults singly lay eggs on only young leaves of M. rubra, and their larvae feed on the leaves. Therefore, the young leaves of M. rubra are necessary for the occurrence of E. gryrotis larvae The number of E. gyrotis larvae per tree was correlated with the amount of young leaves per tree. At the old plantation where E. gyrotis had already been found in 1998, the larval occurrence of E. gyrotis began in late May. At the new plantation, which was at a distance of ca. 600 m from the old plantation, E. gyrotis larvae had not occurred by late July, although there was an abundance of young leaves of M. rubra in late May. These findings suggest that E. gryrotis adults that had emerged from the old plantation in July immigrated to the new plantation and laid eggs on the plants there. The parasitoids that attacked E. gyrotis at the new plantation just after immigration were polyphagous. This suggests that those parasitoids switched hosts from other herbivore species to E. gryotis. In spite of the attack by polyphagous parasitoids, the E. gyrotis population successfully established itself at the new plantation.

TI  - Dynamics of cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hbner) flight in Sombor area during 1994-2003. / Let pamukove sovice (Helicoverpa armigera Hbner) na podruju Sombora u periodu 1994-2003. godine
AB  - The dynamics of cotton bollworm (H. armigera) flight in the town of Sombor in Serbia was monitored for 10 years using Beej-type light traps. During 1997, 1998 and 1999, the population of cotton bollworm was small and less than 200 butterflies were caught annually. In 1994, the incidence of this species was high and 339 butterflies were caught, while in 1995 and 2001 a medium-high incidence was recorded, with 850 butterflies being caught annually. Large populations (1308-1838 individuals) of this insect pest were also observed in 1996, 2000 and 2002. In 2003, extremely high incidence was reported, with 10 027 butterflies trapped. The paper also presents detailed data on the occurrence of peak flight periods and flight dynamics at 5-day periods. The dynamics of butterfly flight varied greatly according to year, probably as a result of the fact that the cotton bollworm is a migratory species whose abundance, just like that of any other insect species, depends on environmental conditions. It is therefore recommended that its butterfly incidence be monitored constantly using light or pheromone traps.

TI  - Performance of the cyclic autumnal moth, Epirrita autumnata, in relation to birch mast seeding
AB  - The mast depression hypothesis has been put forward to explain the 9- to 10-year population cycle of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata; Lepidoptera Geometridae) in northern Fennoscandia. We analysed long-term data from Finnish Lapland in order to evaluate the critical assumption of the mast depression hypothesis that better individual performance of herbivores, followed by high annual growth rate of populations, occurs in the year following mast seeding of the host, the mountain birch (Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii). Since mast seeding has been suggested to occur at the expense of chemical defence against herbivores, we bioassayed the quality of birch leaves from the same trees by means of yearly growth trials with autumnal moth larvae. We also measured the size of wild adults as a determinant of potential fecundity of the species in different years. The relative growth rate of larvae was poorer in post-mast years compared to other years, rather than better as assumed by the hypothesis. Conversely, a slight indication of the increase in potential fecundity was observed due to the somewhat larger adult size in post-mast years. Population growth rate estimates, however, showed that the increase in fecundity would have to be much higher to facilitate population increase towards a cyclic peak with outbreak density. Accordingly, our two data sets do not support the assumption of a higher annual growth rate in autumnal moth populations subsequent to mast seeding of the host, thereby contradicting the predictions of the mast depression hypothesis. Temperatures, when indexed by the North Atlantic Oscillation and accumulated thermal sums, were observed to correlate with the abundance or rate of population change of the autumnal moth. The factors underlying the regular population cycles of the autumnal moth, however, remain unidentified. Overall, we suggest that the causal agents in cyclic insect population dynamics should be clarified by field experimentation, since trophic interactions are complex and are further modified by abiotic factors such as climate.

TI  - Larvae occurrence and moths emergence of the leaf midrib miner, Cosmopterix pararufella Riedl, (Lepidoptera Cosmopterigidae), on sugarcane in Egypt
AB  - The occurrence of larvae and moth emergence of the leaf midrib miner, Cosmopterix pararufella, were studied. Mined leaves were collected weekly from pesticide-free sugarcane fields in Egypt from September to October 2000 and from February 2001 to October 2003. Larvae inhabiting mined tunnels of midribs on infested plant leaves were varied in growth stages in the different years. It generally increased with the ovipositional activity of emerged females while decreased gradually by developing the full-grown larvae to pupae. The increases were observed by mid- and late-May in 2001-03, mid-August and late-October, in all years. It declined to low numbers by early-August and October in all years, also, by late-April (2001 and 2002) and early-May in 2003. The full-grown larvae (approximately 6%) were undeveloped to pupae and lived from 63 to 173 days. Emerged moths accounted for 75, 89.2, 74.3 and 90.6% of the total number of failed and emerged moths in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Moths, overwintering as larvae emerged from late-March, early- and mid-April in 2002, 2001 and 2003 which continued until late-May and early-June. It peaked by mid- and late-April as well as early-May, and was considered the main source of new infestation. The second emergence occurred from early-July to late-August in all years, but continued a week later in 2003. A peak was attained by mid- and late-July in 2002 and 2001 or 2003. However, the last emergence was observed by mid-September and a week later in the first and the last 2 years. The emergence period was prolonged to early- and mid-November and the moth peak was observed by mid-October and late-September. The duration period from the newly-hatched larvae to adult lasted for a mean of 180, 76 and 77 days during early-November to late-May, late-May to mid-August and early-August to late-October in 2002-03. Under both field and laboratory conditions, moths emerged in spring, summer and autumn generations in a year.

TI  - Microlepidoptera in The Netherlands in 2003. / Microlepidoptera in Nederland in 2003
AB  - In this 15th annual report, we record Cydia inquinatana for the first time from 2 localities in the province of Gelderland, Netherlands. We also refer to 4 other new records published elsewhere. The first larvae and mines of Tischeria decidua constitute the second and third records of this species. The leafminers on Cornus sp. (Antispila metalella and A. treitschkiella) are recorded with increasing frequency from city parks; the latter appears now to be at least partly bivoltine. The leafminers Bucculatrix demaryella, Calybites phasianipennella, Phyllonorycter pastorella and Bedellia somnulentella were exceedingly common in 2003 and several new provincial records are given. The very warm and dry summer of 2003 may be partly responsible for the abundance of some of these species. All checked Dutch Oegoconia quadripuncta are in fact O. caradjai and we therefore tentatively remove O. quadripuncta from the Dutch list. Other interesting records include the second Dutch Caloptilia suberinella, the fourth record of Coleophora niveicostella, an inland find of the halophilous Scrobipalpa salinella, the very rare tortricid Gynnidomorpha minimana from Gelderland, the sixth and seventh locality of Endothenia oblongana, the fourth and fifth specimens of Crocidosema plebejana, the first record of Cydia indivisa which was not taken with a pheromone trap and the first far inland records of Vitula biviella. In total we report here 115 species and 56 new provincial records, particularly for Overijssel (11) and Zeeland (14).

TI  - Trapping Chilo sacchariphagus (Lepidoptera Crambidae) in sugarcane using synthetic pheromones
AB  - In June 2002, pheromone-trapping techniques were used successfully to detect the presence of Chilo sacchariphagus in sugarcane at Mafambisse and Marromeu sugar estates in Mozambique. Trap design, bait concentration, trap placement and moth flight activity were examined. A simple trap constructed from a 2-litre plastic bottle and baited with two commercial synthetic sex pheromone vials (1 mg each) attracted and retained males. In mature sugarcane, individuals were caught mostly at 2 m above ground. In the first experiment at Mafambisse, trap efficiency was the highest at 58%. The highest overnight catch in a single trap was 9 males. Positive attributes of pheromone trapping as a monitoring tool are low cost, ease of operation, sensitivity at low population levels, and selectivity that negates the need for sorting. Pheromone trapping was used as a complement to field scouting to determine the distribution of C. sacchariphagus in Mozambique on 2 other estates situated south of Mozambique. Moths were not detected. The pheromone-based trapping technique is being deployed in Malawi and South Africa as an early warning system for this pest. Additional uses include determining moth flight phenology and to examine the relationship between catches and infestation levels. Such knowledge would determine the period and intensity of moth attacks, and would help decide which and when control strategies are warranted.

TI  - Population assessment of Helicoverpa armigera moth through sex pheromone trap
AB  - Male populations of H. armigera were monitored using ICRISAT standard sex pheromone traps in a chickpea field in Pantnagar, Uttar Pradesh, India. The number of trap catches increased with the advancement of crop stage and increase in temperature. Trap catches increased by 3- to 6-fold per week between the 7th and 10th week. Moth populations peaked on the 14th week, and marginally decreased or increased in subsequent weeks. The flowering and podding/pod maturation stages of the crop, which occurred between the 9th and 16th week, coincided with the increase in moth populations. Moth populations declined sharply by 3- to 4-fold on the 17th week to only 3 moths trap-1 night-1 on the 18th week. Trap catches ranged from 3.0 to 0.5 during the post-crop season up to the 22nd week. No moth was captured starting on the 23rd week.

TI  - Flight activity patterns of the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)
AB  - Experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of commercially available synthetic potato tuber moth pheromones for monitoring local tuber moth populations. Tuber moth populations were monitored on farms located in Roodeplaat (1994) and Zeekoegat (1993-95) in South Africa. Three pheromone traps were placed in each field, approximately 100 m apart and 15 m inside the outer edges of the field. All pheromone capsules were replaced after 3 months. Traps were examined weekly throughout the year and all moths were removed and counted. For the purpose of this study, the seasons were defined as summer (December-February), autumn (March-May), winter (June-August) and spring (September-November). A rapid increase in pheromone trap catches was recorded during the warmer summer months. This was followed by a sharp decline in moth numbers during autumn. Moth numbers peaked during or just after summer harvest (January-February). Lower moth numbers were recorded during the colder winter months, although moths were present in traps even during the coldest winter months of 1994 when the minimum temperatures dropped to -2.4C. For a given year, moth numbers fluctuated greatly from one month to the next. This was most obvious during 1993 when average catches declined from almost 1000 moths per week in March to fewer than 100 moths per week in April. The main decline (after summer) occurred during February in 1994 and 1995 and during March in 1993. During 1995, the increase in moth numbers at the end of winter was gradual, taking several months, while a sudden increase occurred during November 1993 and 1994. A sharp decline in numbers occurred in December in all 3 years. At the beginning of 1994, numbers increased to more than 1200 (from approximately 700 during the previous year's December), but during the following year (1995), the numbers remained lower (500-600) for the rest of the summer. During the winter months of 1995, however, more moths were caught in traps than during the 2 previous years. These results indicate a positive correlation between temperature and moth numbers. Tuber moth numbers differed between the adjacent farms depending on the time of the year. There was always significantly higher numbers in traps during the warmer months at Zeekoegat, except for February and October, than at Roodeplaat. Moth numbers remained below 100 per week for both farms during colder months (April to August). For March, April and December, Zeekoegat had twice as many tuber moths in traps than Roodeplaat. This study also showed that the commercial potato tuber moth pheromone is very effective against the local moth population and under South African conditions.

TI  - Impact of silicon in alleviating biotic stress in sugarcane in South Africa
AB  - For many years, silicon (Si) deficiency in crops was relatively unknown and this element was widely regarded as non-essential for plant growth. In recent years, Si has emerged as an important nutrient for a wide variety of crops including rice, sugarcane, wheat, barley and a range of horticultural crops. With the exception of potassium, sugarcane is known to take up more Si than any other mineral nutrient, with the potential to accumulate almost 400 kg/ha of Si, in a 12-month old irrigated crop. Early studies have tended to emphasise the role of Si in alleviating abiotic stress caused by factors such Al and Mn toxicity in soils. In recent years, research increasingly has focused on the beneficial role of Si in alleviating biotic stress from factors such as pests and disease. In South Africa, the stalk borer Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) has been the most destructive pest in sugarcane and has over the past 30 years caused huge annual crop losses. This paper documents some of the more important studies and outcomes of research into the beneficial role of silicon amendments in increasing the resistance of sugarcane to the Eldana stalk borer, especially in varieties susceptible to this borer.

TI  - Influence of different host plants on the biology and behaviour of the green oak leaf roller, Tortrix viridana L. first results
AB  - In Italy, the green oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana, is a widespread pest in pure and mixed formations of deciduous and evergreen oaks. Even if many studies have been carried out on the biology and the ethology of this defoliating insect, methods to detect the occurrence of outbreaks are still lacking, and available information about the influence of different oak species on the preimaginal development is still inadequate. Therefore, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the T. viridana ecology in Italian environments, in 2003-04, a study was carried out in a tuscany oak stand composed prevalently of Quercus cerris and Quercus pubescens, with the occurrence of a severe infestation of T. viridana. The flight periods were monitored during the spring and summer 2003 and 2004. In the late autumn of 2003, twig samples were collected from 7 Q. pubescens and 5 Q. cerris specimens, at two different tree strata (24 m and 5-7 m), in order to assess the presence of eggs. In addition, starting 15 March 2004, on three of the most infested trees of each oak species, 60 twigs were examined weekly, in order to ascertain the influence of the host plant on the beginning and during the course of the leaf roller development. The results confirmed the adult emergence in late spring-early summer. The number of laid eggs was similar on the two oak species, the most part being deposited in the higher strata (about 64% on Q. pubescens and 62% on Q. cerris). Larvae hatched almost three weeks earlier on Q. cerris than on Q. pubescens, and also the pupal stage occurred about two weeks earlier on Q. cerris.

TI  - The use of a natural predation of tits (Paridae) in the control of overwintering Codling moth caterpillars (Cydia pomonella L.) in commercial apple orchards. / Moznosti vyuzit prirozen predan schopnosti skor (Paridae) v regulaci vskytu prezimujcch housenek obalee jablenho (Cydia pomonella L.) v produknch sadech
AB  - The possibility of the apple protection against overwintering Codling moth (C. pomonella) caterpillars by means of the artificially increased predation activity of tits (Paridae) was tested during period 1989-2001 in Czech Republic. For this purpose the plastic bird boxes were installed in the various site conditions. During the trials the number of Codling moth caterpillars predated by tits and the emergence of tits in orchards were observed. It has been shown that natural predation is usually very high (&gt;95% in some cases) in the plantings situated in landscapes with high diversity, in young plantings and also in small neighbouring orchards in villages or private gardens. Here, the installation of bird boxes is not effective in terms of reduction of overwintering Codling moth caterpillars. On the contrary, emergence of tits and their predation activity are low in the large (tens of hectares acreage) and old orchards surrounded by fields. The increase of predation activities was observed after the installation of artificial shelters.

TI  - It is possible to anticipate peach twig borer infestations on peach. / Le infestazioni di anarsia su pesco si possono prevedere
AB  - Since 2001, populations of the peach twig borer, Anarsia lineatella, in peach orchards in the Piedmont region of northern Italy have been increasing significantly, so much so that in 2003 serious reductions in yield were recorded. In 2004, although population levels were again high, yield losses were contained at economically acceptable levels thanks to adequate control. With a view to developing integrated pest control measures, studies were undertaken during 2003-04 in various peach-growing areas of Piedmont to verify the applicability of a method used in the USA of predicting the flight of the over-wintering generation and the start of first generation larval activity. This method is based on calculating specific temperature sums to simulate successive phenological events (a) initiation, 50% and end of first flight, and (b) start of emergence of first generation larvae. The model produced allows decisions to be made on the most appropriate time for the installation of pheromone traps and diffusers for mating confusion and disorientation, and the correct time for the first ovicide and larvicide interventions. To verify the temperature sums simulation model, flights were monitored in 20 peach plantations (10 in each year) using Isagro and Novapher pheromone traps installed from the beginning of May. The results obtained in the 2 years were very encouraging in that average errors registered for the model were within acceptable limits.

TI  - Combining tools for the control of codling moth in the Provence-Alpes-Cte-d'Azur Region. / Combiner les outils contre le carpocapse en Provence-Alpes-Cte-d'Azur
AB  - Monitoring of commercial orchards in the Provence-Alpes Cte d'Azur region in France, conducted by the Regional Plant Protection Office (SRPV) and a range of other organizations has produced useful information pertaining to the population dynamics of apple and pear codling moth (Cydia pomonella) and has made it possible to draw up a series of practical recommendations for protection against the pest. Field tests with granulosis virus (Carpovirusine 2000) have confirmed prior laboratory findings an effect on the codling moth generation immediately following that to which it is applied. This therefore constitutes a useful tool when used in combination with other tools (observations conducted on highly infested orchards). Mating disruption is not effective in preventing a slow and steady growth of populations (based on a 2-year study of approximately 300 orchards each year). Hence, constant monitoring and complementary, integrated interventions (granulosis virus or chemical insecticides)is needed. Rational use of chemical insecticides, group I organophosphorous pesticides and/or insect growth regulators still has a meaningful role to play in conventional farming.

TI  - Control of codling moth Cydia pomonella L. using insecticides relationship between susceptibility and efficacy in the field
AB  - Field and laboratory experiments were conducted in Italy, in 2003 and 2004, to detect insecticide resistant Cydia pomonella populations. Results showed a generalized reduced efficacy in the control of C. pomonella, even though the orchards were highly infested and the trials were carried out under favourable climatic conditions. A reduction in the susceptibility of codling moth populations was therefore hypothesized. The susceptibility of C. pomonella populations was assessed using in laboratory bioassays. Larvae were collected from orchards where reduced efficacy was observed. Young larvae, less than 10 mg in weight, were collected from infested fruits and tested by feeding them with apples coated with a discriminating dose of insecticide. A large difference between the expected mortality and that obtained in the dipping test were recorded for 3 out of 8 tested insecticides tebufenozide -8.7%, methoxyfenozide -23.2% and chlorpyrifos -41.8%. In the second bioassay, overwintering larvae collected in cardboard bands were treated topically with a discriminating dose of insecticide. A significant reduction in the mortality was recorded for 8 out of 13 tested insecticides when the average of 2 years worth of data were considered. Two other insecticides showed a significant reduction only in the second year, while only deltametrine [deltamethrin], spinosad and emamectine [emamectin] did not show significant loss in their activity. The topical application technique was used to monitor the susceptibility of 18 populations. Overwintering larvae collected in different apple growing districts in Trentino, Italy, were treated with the discriminating dose of tebufenozide. The survey confirmed that C. pomonella from orchards that received a large number of applications of tebufenozide are no longer susceptible to this insecticide.

TI  - Growth loss of Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani) stands as related to periodic outbreaks of the cedar shoot moth (Dichelia cedricola)
AB  - An outbreak of D. cedricola, the cedar shoot moth (CSM), began in spring 1998 and lasted 3 years. This was the first monitored outbreak of the CSM in Isparta, Turkey. Tree crowns recovered to near normal condition by the middle of each growing season (in early June) during the outbreak. Tree volume and volume element increments were examined throughout the outbreak cycle from 1954 to 2001. In the past, CSM activity in stands of Lebanon cedar (C. libani) was assessed through radial increment analyses. Cedar tree ring chronologies were analysed for evidence of the CSM. Tree-ring chronologies from nonhost cedar (nondefoliated sample trees) were used to estimate potential growth in the host cedar (defoliated sample trees) during current and past outbreaks; all trees selected were the same subspecies and varieties. Regional outbreaks of the CSM were identified by synchronous and sustained growth periods of the trees. In 2001, increment cores were collected from 17 host and 16 nonhost dominant or codominant trees and annual radial growth indices from 1954-2001 were calculated for each of 2 host and 2 nonhost sample plots. Growth functions were defined as the cumulative sum of radial, height, and volume increment, and were graphically compared between CSM host cedar and nonhost cedar trees. Tree ring evidence suggests that a large-scale outbreak occurred in 1955 (from 1955 to 1966) and a small outbreak occurred in 1985 (1985-1990) and in 1998 (1998-continued) in the study area. The average diameter growth reductions around 1955, 1985 and 1998 were 40%, 46% and 7% of potential, respectively. It was concluded that a narrow latewood band is significant indicator of defoliation by the CSM and the outbreaks appear to be associated with dry winter and spring weather prior to the autumn and winter in which wood feeding occurred.

TI  - Monitoring of plum fruit moth (Grapholita funebrana [Treitschke], Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) in extensive orchards in Slovenia. / Spremljanje zastopanosti epljevega zavijaa (Grapholita funebrana [Treitschke], Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) v ekstenzivnih sadovnjakih v Sloveniji
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to monitor the occurrence of the plum fruit moth (Grapholita funebrana[Cydia funebrana]) in Slovenia. In 2004, on six locations (Gabernik, Latkova vas, Dol near Hrastnik, Rakitnica, Zelimlje, Kromberk near Nova Gorica) pheromone traps were placed in extensive orchards. The aim of the research was to determine the number of generations it develops per year in climatically and geographically different regions. Based upon this monitoring (from the middle of April till the end of October) it can be concluded that the plum fruit moth has 3 generations per year only in the littoral part of Slovenia (Kromberk), while, in the continental part of the country it has 2 generation per year. In addition, bionomics of the pest, types of damage it causes and harmfulness of the moth are presented.

TI  - Flowering phenology, seed set and arthropod guilds in Trichogoniopsis adenantha (DC) (Asteraceae) in south-east Brazil
AB  - Trichogoniopsis adenantha (Asteraceae) is a shrub plant that inhabits forest margins and glades. This species blooms throughout the year, attracting arthropods of various guilds, including herbivores, pollinators and predators. In this study, done over a two year period, we described the phenology of T. adenantha and assessed the seasonal variation in arthropod numbers of different guilds. We also determined the periods of lowest and highest seed set. T. adenantha population showed a peak in flowering in March-April (rainy season) with greater production of achenes in December-April. April and October had respectively highest and lowest number of fertilized, undamaged ovules, and this pattern is possibly related with population dynamics of pollinators and herbivores. In August, which was the period of greatest damage to the stigma (by geometrid larvae), there was a positive relationship between the proportion of unfertilized ovules and flowers with damaged stigma, suggesting that floral herbivory may affect reproduction in T. adenantha. We discuss the complex dynamics of the beneficial and harmful interactions between arthropods and the host plant.

AB  - A study was conducted during 2001-02 in 9 olive orchards from 3 villages in Mut district, Mersin province of Turkey, where pesticide application is nearly absent, to determined the population dynamics of adult, infestation ratio and injury level in the leaf, flower and fruit generations of P. oleae. By using pheromone traps, it was observed that the adult population of P. oleae was the highest in the second generation and the lowest in the third generation in 2002. Although the ratio of the olive fruits having larva entrance holes was high (60%), the ratio of the fruits with larva exit holes was very low (14%). The yield loss due to the olive moth was 3.2-5.4%.

TI  - The adult population fluctuations of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in flour factories in Bursa province
AB  - An experiment was conducted in Bursa, Turkey, during 2000-02 to determine the adult population fluctuations of Ephestia kuehniella in flour factories using pheromone traps. The first E. kuehniella adults were observed on April while adult flight decreased after October. A total of 2-4 distinct flight peaks were observed in the flour factories, which were usually dense in the machine section of the factory. The pheromone traps were effective in determining adult emergence and density in storage houses.

AB  - The seasonal phenology of the summer fruit tortrix, Adoxophyes orana fasciata, was examined from 1980 to 2002 using sex pheromone traps at seven apple orchards in Aomori Prefecture. From 1980 to the early 1990s, the trap catch pattern in the Tsugaru region (west Aomori) showed three peaks of moth abundance per year, corresponding to moths of the overwintering, first and second generations. However, the patterns after the early 1990s showed only two peaks per year. The peak of the overwintering generation occurred in the early to mid-June in the trivoltine pattern, whereas in the bivoltine shifted from the end of July in the trivoltine pattern to the end of August in the bivoltine pattern. The total effective temperature (above 5.9C) between adult flight peaks of two successive generations in the bivoltine pattern was 1060 degree-days, which was greater than that in the trivoltine pattern (approximately 700 degree-days). In contrast, the trap catch pattern in the Nanbu region (east Aomori) showed two annual peaks throughout the period examined (1980-2002).

TI  - Microlepidopteran hazelnut pest in Central-Eastern Poland
AB  - The list of insects and mites associated with hazelnut shrubs is extremely long but only a few of them are harmful, the remaining ones being either beneficial or incidental. Pest incidence and importance has changed in time as well as the cultural practices used in the orchards. Some of the pest problems are primarily induced by the use of insecticides. In orchards where no chemical treatments and horticulture techniques are applied, some pests like microlepidopteran species can have economic significance. The aim of this research was to establish the species composition of microlepidopteran occurring in two ecosystems formed by man to various degrees. Data were gathered at 10-day intervals during three growing seasons (1998-2000) in two ecosystems a protected hazelnut orchard and an unprotected one, in central-eastern Poland. Six microlepidopteran species were found Stigmella microtheriella and S. floslactella [Nepticula floslactella] from the Nepticulidae family; Parornix avellanella, Phyllonorycter coryli and P. nicellii from the Gracillaridae family; and Coleophora serratella from the Coleophoridae family. The main factor affecting the occurrence of microlepidopteran species feeding on the hazelnut, with regards only to quantitative composition, was the type of environment with different chemical treatments. Differences in microlepidopteran species composition between the two studied orchards were not confirmed. Species from the genus Phyllonorycter were dominant in both orchards, whereas S. floslactella and C. serratella occurred in the smallest number. Abandoning suitable chemical pest control and horticultural techniques resulted in an increase in the number of microlepidopteran species.

TI  - The life cycle of the pine processionary caterpillar in the bioclimatic conditions of a sub-Saharan region
AB  - Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidopetra, Thaumetopoeidae) is a gregarious univoltin species. In the pine (Pinus halepensis) stands of the sub-Saharan regions, this defoliating insect has adaptive mechanisms related to temporal adjustments of its phenology emergence rhythms of adults, larval development and aptitude to pupal diapause. These mechanisms have a direct effect on the evolution of the demographic strategies of the insect. According to the model of Demolin that predicts all possible life cycles, depending on temperature and elevation, it appeared that the life cycle at Djelfa (Algerian sub-Sahara) was similar to that at Antibes (French Mediterranean rim). At the southern limit of the distribution area, the frequency and duration of maximum temperatures higher than 30C led to periods of adult emergences varying between plots and years, whereas minimum temperatures played a major role in the other localities of the distribution area. Thus, although a 30-day delay occurred between the period of main adult flights and the oviposition period on the north rim of the Mediterranean Sea, the pupation processions took place at about the same dates as in Djelfa. Otherwise, by comparing the two types of larval developments, the model of Demolin, based on thermal and insulation thresholds, showed that larval development could take up to 7 or 8 months at Djelfa whereas it could take less than 5 months in other conditions.

TI  - Species composition of leaf-rolling caterpillars on three wild cherry strains
AB  - The species composition of leaf-rolling microlepidoptera on 3 species of wild cherry (Prunus verucunda, P. apetala and P. grayana) was studied in Sendai, Japan. The microlepidopteran communities were monitored once a week from April to July 2004. A total of 8 species belonging to the families Tortricidae and Gelechiidae were collected. On P. verucunda, Eudemis profundana, Archips xylosteanus, A. fuscocupreanus, A. viola, Compsolechia anisogramma and Carbatina picrocarpa were collected, and E. profundana was the dominant species (mean number of larvae/100 shoots=3.80). On P. apetala, Olethreutes moderata, A. xylosteanus and C. anisogramma were collected. However, the density of each leaf roller on P. apetala was quite low (mean number of larvae/100 shoots=&lt;0.13). On P. grayana, although only Rhopobota naevana was collected, its density (mean number of larvae/100 shoots=16.80) was highest among the 8 microlepidopteran species collected. These results clearly show that the species composition of leaf-rolling microlepidoptera among the 3 wild cherry species is slightly different, although the 3 cherries are sympatric species.

TI  - Interesting Macrolepidoptera findings in Sweden 2004. / Intressanta fynd av storfjrilar (Macrolepidoptera) i Sverige 2004
AB  - This is the 32nd consecutive annual report of interesting findings of Macrolepidoptera in Sweden. Despite a rainier summer than most of the recent seasons, several remarkable findings were made during 2004, and five species new for Sweden were recorded. In June, a single specimen of Antonechloris smaragdaria was found in the archipelago of Stockholm. In July, Hadena luteago was found on the Baltic island Gotland and Polia conspicua was found close to the Finnish border in Norrbotten. Two specimens of Agrotis crassa were found on the Baltic island land in August and six specimens of Thaumetopoea processionea were found in mid-august in southernmost Skne. Occasional findings were reported of presumptive migrants as Agrius convolvuli, Macroglossum stellatarum, Nymphalis xanthomelas, Rhodometra sacraria, Orthonama obstipata, Eulithis pyropata, Colobochyla salicalis, Cucullia fraudatrix, Cucullia artemisiae, Eucarta virgo, Hydraecia ultima, Lacanobia splendens, Noctua interposita, Cryptocalia chardinyi, Peridroma saucia, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, Nycteola asiatica and Eilema griseola. Established populations in southeast Skne has been found of Minucia lunaris, Hoplodrina ambigua and Mythimna l-album. The large number of species extending their range northwards continued also during 2004 and new provincial records are compiled in the end of this report. A new redlist was established in May 2005 and we would like to draw attention to the need of better knowledge about the actual distribution of many species to confirm suspected declines. Two species; Mellicta britomartis and Cucullia argentea appear to be on the verge of extinction and in need of immediate conservation measures. The total number of species reported from Sweden is 1097, of which nine are considered as introduced.

TI  - Constant monitoring enhances the success of pheromones in IFP
AB  - In 1993, the Advisory Service decided to propose to its members to put the mating disruption method for the control of codling moth, Cydia pomonella, in practice. In 1993, some 232 ha of the South Tyrolean apple-growing area were equipped with pheromone dispensers for codling moth. Until 2004, this area has risen to 14 000 ha, which amounts to 78% of the total acreage in South Tyrol. In the past 12 years, the technicians of the South Extension Service have therefore had ample opportunity to study the possibilities and limits of this environment-friendly plant protection technique and to increase and improve their experience in monitoring orchards with mating disruption. It is concluded that on ~50% of the area with mating disruption, codling moth populations can be kept at a low level without additional treatments; on ~40% of the acreage with mating disruption, 1-2 additional sprays are needed to keep harvest damage below 1%; and on ~10% of the orchard area with mating disruption, intensive monitoring is indispensable for limiting the number of additional treatments and preventing an increase of the population density.

TI  - Behaviour of Lobesia botrana in table grape vineyards. / Comportamento della tignoletta in vigneti a uva da tavola
AB  - An account is given of a survey conducted from 1991 to 2000 in vineyards in eastern Sicily, using pheromone traps to monitor flying insects and also examining samples of grapes for damage. Results showed flight of the 1st generation of adults starting in the first 10 days of April, peaking in the second fortnight of the month and the 1st decade of May, total duration about 50 days. Second generation flight started early in August and peaked at the end of the month or in late September. Third generation flight generally followed a similar pattern and 4th flight overlapped the third and lasted to early October. The literature concerning safety thresholds and the timing of insecticide treatments is discussed.

TI  - A study on comparative performance of redgram during kharif and rabi season under front line demonstration
AB  - A study was conducted in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, India to determine the better performance of pigeon pea during rabi than kharif season under front line demonstrations. Five cultivars (LRG-30, ICPL-85063, ICPL-87119, ICPL-332 and ICPL-8863) of pigeon pea were tried at 3 different locations (2 villages from Uyalawada mandal and one village from Dornipadu) both in kharif and rabi for 3 consecutive years (1999-2002). The plant architecture i.e. plant height, number of branches and duration was reduced significantly in rabi season, hence increased population density will help to achieve the yield per unit area and also cultivating pigeon pea in rabi results in the escape from pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) infestation. All the 5 cultivars performed excellently well, giving higher yields during rabi and kharif seasons.

TI  - Efficiency of different pheromonal blends to monitor Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) moth catches
AB  - Pheromone traps containing 973, 251 and 101 ratios of Helicoverpa armigera sex pheromones (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z-11-16Ald) and (Z)-9-hexadecenal (Z-9-6Ald) were set-up in chickpea fields during February-May 2002 in Uttaranchal, India. The traps were also set-up in sunflower fields at 251 and 973 ratios of Z-11-HDAL and Z-9-HDAL. The moth catches in chickpea fields were maximum during the 10th and 11th standard week in 251 ratio. There were 0.4 and 1.2 moths per trap per week in 673 and 101 ratios during the 9th and 10th standard weeks. Slightly higher moth catches were found in traps with 251 blend (2.7 moths per trap per week). The pheromone traps in sunflower fields showed higher moth catches (1.33-54.33 moths per trap per week) in a 973 ratio compared to 251 ratio (0.33-37.67 moths per trap per week). The highest number of trap catches were recorded in the middle of the 15th and 16 standard weeks. The population trend of H. armigera declined until the 18th and 19th standard weeks. The relationship between moth catches and weather parameters was also studied. The first appearance of H. armigera in chickpea fields corresponded to a maximum temperature of above 25C and minimum temperature of 10C, maximum relative humidity above 88% and minimum of 51%, minimum rain of 0.31 mm and wind velocity of 2.49-5.48 km/h. The highest moth activity in sunflower fields was observed with the maximum temperature of 31-34C and minimum temperature of 16-18C, maximum relative humidity of 70-72% and minimum relative humidity of 31-33%, and wind velocity of 2-4 km/h. Moth catches of H. armigera in 973, 251, 101 (Z-(11)-HDALZ(9)-HDAL) blends showed positive non-significant correlation with maximum relative humidity, minimum relative humidity and wind velocity in chickpea. There was a significant negative correlation between moth catches in 251 pheromonal blend in sunflower and wind velocity.

TI  - Role of neonicotinyl insecticides in Washington apple integrated pest management. Part II. Nontarget effects on integrated mite control
AB  - The effect of neonicotinyl insecticides on integrated mite control in Washington apple was examined from 2000-2004. In a series of 20 field trials (54 treatments) designed primarily to look at efficacy against the codling moth, Cydia pomonellai, nearly half of the treatments using four or more applications of acetamiprid had peak mite densities exceeding the economic threshold of 5 mites per leaf. Overall, acetamiprid treatments had 4.6-fold higher mite densities than the standard organophosphate insecticide treatment. Of the treatments with high mite populations, Panonychus ulmi, the European red mite, and Tetranychus urticae, the twospotted spider mite, were the dominant species in roughly equal numbers of cases. Only 11.1% of the thiacloprid treatments exceeded 5 mites per leaf; these experimental treatments included eight applications, whereas the current label restricts the number of applications at the rate for C. pomonella to two applications. One out of six clothianidin treatments caused a significantly higher mite density than the standard treatment; however, this material appeared to suppress predatory mites. Neonicotinyl insecticides did not eliminate predatory mites, but they inhibited their ability to respond normally to increasing prey populations. In field trials designed specifically to examine mite population densities where neonicotinyl insecticides were used, significantly higher levels of tetranychid mites occurred in one or more acetamiprid treatments (one, two or four applications) in five out of six trials. In the sixth trial (in a commercial orchard), only two acetamiprid applications were made, and mite populations were low in all treatments. While elevated mite densities were more likely to occur with four applications, in one case it occurred following a single application. The predominant tetranychid mite species (either P. ulmi or T. urticae) varied from trial to trial; however, there was no apparent bias regarding stimulation of the two species. Horticultural mineral oil was used with acetamiprid in some trials in an attempt to mitigate mite outbreaks. However, the addition of oil did not counteract the tendency of acetamiprid to increase tetranychid mite populations, and in one trial, had a negative effect on predatory mite densities. Seasonal tetranychid mite density was positively related to the total grams AI (or number of applications) of acetamiprid, thus reducing the number of applications per season should lower the probability of mite outbreaks.

TI  - Influence of weather on population dynamics of Spodoptera - a polyphagous pest
AB  - A study was conducted in Tamil Nadu, India during 1999-2000 to investigate the effects of weather parameters on the population dynamics of Spodoptera sp. Pheromone traps were used to monitor the moth population. Frequency analysis showed that moth activity was high under maximum and minimum temperatures of 26 and 18C, respectively. Moth population increased with increasing relative humidity and cloudiness. A total of 50 moths per week emerged when the morning relative humidity increased from 85.6 to 89.4%. Moth population was high with a rainfall of 20-40 mm/week. Among the different seasons (cold weather, January-February; hot weather, March-May; South West Monsoon, June-September; and North East Monsoon, October-December), the South West Monsoon season showed the highest effect on the eruption of moth population.

TI  - Analysis of annual fluctuation of Plutella xylostella pheromone trap
AB  - Annual fluctuation of monthly occurrence of Plutella xylostella in 1986-2003 was studied in Morioka in Japan, using the figures of the insects trapped in sex pheromone traps. The occurrence has a peak in August in common in all years, but there was a second peak (approximately more than 20 trapped insects/half month) in September since 1990. In 1991 and 2001, more than 100 trapped insects in half month are reported at a second peak. This change is considered due to the decreasing parasite ratio by wasps, which might be caused by weather conditions, such as rainfall and low temperature.

TI  - Charateristics of microsatellite DNA in lepidopteran genomes and implications for their isolation
AB  - A comparative analysis of microsatellite DNA in lepidopteran insects was carried out, based on our data from microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries of lepidopteran insects (the cotton bollworm and the masson pine moth) and a variety of other organisms (the migratory locust, gadoid fishes, fen raft spider and the crested ibis), as well as published data on other lepidopteran insects. Our results suggest that (1) Both the proportion of the positive clones in genomic libraries and the optimization efficiency of microsatellite loci are much lower in lepidopteran insects than in other organisms. (2) A much larger proportion of microsatellite loci bear repetitive flanking region(s) in lepidopteran insects than in other organisms and some are present as multicopy microsatellite DNA families. This means that although the overall abundance of microsatellite loci in lepidopterans is lower, the proportion of multicopy loci is more pronounced. Therefore, the majority of positive clones from genomic libraries are not suitable for use as diagnostic markers in population genetic analysis. This considerably increases the difficulty in microsatellite isolation in lepidopteran insects. (3) There are relatively more trinucleotide microsatellite loci in the cotton bollworm, with the majority of them being a single copy locus. This compensates somewhat the difficulty in the isolation of effectively usable microsatellite markers in this species. (4) Null allele appears to be a commonly occurring phenomenon for lepidopteran polymorphic microsatellite loci. It means that there possibly exists an elevated mutation rate in the flanking regions of microsatellite sequences in this group of insects. (5) The existence of poly(T/A) sequences in the repetitive flanking regions of microsatellites suggests that retrotransposition or retrofection may be involved in the formation of microsatellite DNA families and other multicopy microsatellite loci.

TI  - Effects of conversion of pure pine stands on ground dwelling spiders (Arachnida Araneae) as potential pest antagonists. / Effekte von Waldumbaumassnahmen in Kiefernforsten auf potenzielle Schdlingsantagonisten am Beispiel der epigischen Webspinnen (Arachnida Araneae)
AB  - The effects of conversion of commercial pine stands by planting deciduous trees or tolerating natural regeneration on the structure and functionality of ground-dwelling spiders in the northern Saxonian Lowlands were investigated. The study sites (n=8) were established in 2 different areas (latency gradation area) which were characterized by different climatic parameters and susceptibility to mass gradation of pest insects. One pure pine forest served as reference in each area. Spiders were collected by pitfall traps (n=8 per site) during the vegetation periods of 2000 and 2001. The results were based on the determination of 21 500 Araneae (150 species, 21 families), of which 14 Araneae are listed in the Red Data Book of Germany and 19 species of Saxony. The dominant families were Linyphiidae (n=66, 51%), Gnaphosidae (n=15, 6%) and Lycosidae (n=9, 26%) regarding to their species and relative abundance. In contrast to this, the activity biomass showed a dominance of the Lycosidae (51%), Amaurobiidae (16%) and Gnaphosidae (11%). Forest conversion showed contrasting effects, depending on affiliation of the study sites to the area of latency or gradation. In the gradation area, species diversity, individual numbers and activity biomass increased with complexity of the forest structure from pure pine stand to the pine stand with natural regeneration and with beech trees in the understorey. The coincidence between different live stages of phytophagous Lepidoptera (Panolis flammea) and spider antagonists indicated an increase in the predation potential due to high activity biomass. Site-specific trees and the cultivation of hardwood may support the biostability of pure stands while in the area of abundance raised only in the initial growth.

TI  - Detection of codling moth (Cydia pomonella) resistance by topical application of insecticides and validation on a laboratory resistant strain by dipping of apples and incorporating products into artificial diets
AB  - Dose-mortality reference curves were established for 13 insecticides (diflubenzuron, emamectin, fenoxycarb, thiacloprid, tebufenozide, imidacloprid, methoxyfenoxide, spinosad, deltamethrin, indoxacarb, phosalone, chlorpyrifos-ethyl [chlorpyrifos] and chlorpyrifos-methyl) administered by topical application to diapausing larvae from a susceptible codling moth (C. pomonella) strain. Discriminating doses, determined for the detection of resistance in field-collected diapausing larvae, were between 1 and 10 000 ppm, depending on the product. A resistance survey was carried out by topical application of discriminating concentrations on diapausing larvae of codling moth collected in Swiss and Italian orchards. In the worst cases, cross-resistance concerned 12 out of the 13 insecticides tested. In some other orchards, the pronounced loss of efficacy seemed to concern only some products, but the other insecticides also showed undeniable signs of 'fatigue'. To validate the topical application technique as a detection tool, different products were tested in the laboratory with 2 other techniques on a codling moth susceptible strain (SS) as well as on a resistant strain (RS). Insecticides were applied either by dipping apples in solutions or by incorporating them into an artificial diet. For the majority of the products tested so far, the resistance of the RS strain detected by topical application seemed to be confirmed by tests of dipping apples or by incorporation of the products into the artificial diet. However, the factors of resistance obtained varied according to the detection technique.

TI  - Protecting the vine. / Difesa della vite
AB  - The state of health of Italian vineyards in 2004 is reviewed region by region. The major problem was Peronospora in the centre south, but damage there was not severe; in the north only Veneto suffered badly, with the worst outbreak for 25 years. Flavescenza dorata was under control everywhere. Insect pests were a problem in Sicily, Veneto and Sardinia. To achieve maximum efficiency, cautious use of pesticides is essential based on a knowledge of the mode of action and recommended use of the different chemicals. A wide range of products against Peronospora, Oidium and Botrytis is discussed, stressing the role of good agronomic practice in minimising the use of chemicals and the importance of attention to weather forecasts, varying the pesticides and using the most appropriate to the environmental conditions. The course of a severe epidemic of Plasmopara viticola was monitored weekly at 13 sites in Veneto. Detailed charts show the weather from October to July and the progress of the epidemic at each site. Working groups met weekly to discuss the data obtained and proved very valuable. A 5-year experiment near Ravenna studied the role of sexual confusion in controlling populations of Lobesia botrana. The results obtained each year are discussed separately. The initial high populations were significantly reduced by the 3rd year, but increased again the following year in response to favourable weather conditions. Supplementary control measures were needed in most years but in another experiment with less density of L. botrana the pheromones alone gave adequate control.

TI  - Stress management in insect pests on oil palm, Elaeis guineensis Jacq
AB  - A survey was conducted in the oil palm orchards of Krishna, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh, India, during 1995-2002 to determine insect pest incidence on different aged palms. Case studies were conducted to observe the yield losses due to pest attack by selecting two leaf eating caterpillar-infested gardens (10 years old) in Billanapalli village, Krishna. Both the gardens were at their peak yielding stages. Psychid Metisa plana, leaf webber Ambadra sp. were observed as endemic pests whereas incidence of limacodid, Darna catenatus, was observed for the first time during 1999 in West Godavari. The stress due to defoliation by these pests resulted into yield loss, which continued for two to three years after attack. Control measures (root absorption techniques) that were taken immediately after the attack led to the effective control of the pests. Even after that, the resultant effect on the yield could be seen for next 18 months period. However, gardens not protected at the correct time showed prolonged yield loss for more than two years. Control measures in the form of root absorption techniques effectively controlled the pest infestation. Control measures applied immediately after the pest outbreak caused low impact on the yield losses. Delay in the implementation of the control measures resulted into severe defoliation with reduced yields for nearly three years.

TI  - Dynamics of appearing Cydia molesta and Anarsia lineatella in peach orchards in Slovenia
AB  - Peaches have been already known in Slovenia three hundred years ago. Ever since planting the first peach orchards, the oriental fruit moth (C. molesta [Grapholita molesta]) and peach twig borer (A. lineatella) are mentioned as the most important pests. They spread from Italy to Slovenia in the 1930s of the twentieth century. The control of these pests is very difficult. Additional problem presents the number of these individuals on the population, the time of occurrence and spreading the damage on the other types of fruits. If we compare recent observations with long-term observations, we can see that the beginning of the flights of the first generation are earlier and the endings of the second generations are extended into autumn. Another problem is the growth of the population of oriental fruit moth in apple orchards, which are the leading sort of fruit in Posavje region. In Slovenia, there are two major areas of peach production Primorska region with sub-Mediterranean climate and Posavje region with continental climate. The average temperatures of these two areas come close because of the growth of the mid-day temperatures in Posavje region, which is proved by observation and comparison of the populations. Exterminations with available resources for plant protection are not giving satisfactory results (13-54% efficacy). Because these pests also represent a big problem in apple orchards, we are planning bigger accentuation on biological control. This includes also recognition, protection and stimulation of autochthonous organisms, and use of biotic products.

TI  - The status of Eldana saccharina (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in the South African sugar industry based on regular survey data
AB  - The Local Pest, Disease and Variety Control Committee Eldana saccharina survey records from 2001 to 2003 were analysed to investigate the pest status of this stalk borer in the South African sugarcane industry. The percentage of damaged stalks (SD), stalks with red coloration (SLR) and numbers of larvae per 100 stalks varied in different mill areas. Furthermore, damage levels were higher in the coastal than the inland regions. Higher levels of damage were correlated with older cane, and certain varieties suffered more damage than others. Infestations were lower in small-scale than commercial grower sectors. Higher levels of damage were associated with increased nitrogen applied to fields. The estimated economic injury level was 7% SLR and 54% SD.

TI  - Low diversity but high differentiation the population genetics of Aglaope infausta (Zygaenidae Lepidoptera)
AB  - Aim A. infausta is a thermophilous Zygaenid of Atlanto-Mediterranean origin, distributed in Portugal, Spain, France and northwestern Italy reaching its northeastern distribution limit in western Germany. The local, regional and inter-regional genetic structure of this species is studied in this analysis. Methodology The alloenzymes of 456 individuals from 12 populations (11 from western Germany and one from southern Portugal) were studied by electrophoresis. Results Six of the 19 loci analysed were monomorphic. Genetic differentiation between populations was high (FST 0.404), while the mean genetic diversity was low (He 3.4%). Most (96.5%) of the genetic variance between populations was between the Portuguese and the German samples, but also the differentiation within Germany was considerable (FSR 0.101). In Germany, A. infausta occurs in two major regions (middle Rhine and Nahe) that are geographically separated, and 55.5% of the genetic variance was between these two regions. The populations of both areas do not differ in their genetic diversity, but those of the middle Rhine have significantly higher genetic distances among them than the Nahe populations (0.020 and 0.015, respectively). FST was also higher in the middle Rhine region than in the Nahe region (0.089 and 0.045, respectively). Conclusions A. infausta shows a very low level of genetic heterogeneity for a lepidopteran species. However, this genetic poverty is not affecting the species' viability. During the ice ages, differentiation into two genetic lineages occurred, most probably in a southwestern and a southeastern differentiation centre in Iberia. The gap in the distribution range in Germany is clearly reflected in the genetic structure. This differentiation must have developed relatively quickly because western Germany most probably was colonized during the climatic optimum 6000 years ago.

TI  - Effects of outbreaks of the autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata on the mountain birch forest. / Fjllbjrkskogen - ett helt ekosystem som styrs av en liten fjril
AB  - We studied the effects of a geometrid moth (the autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata) on the long-term dynamics of the mountain birch (Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii) forest of northwestern Europe. The moth population density varied strongly among years and showed peaks at approximately 9-year intervals. Most of the population peaks had relatively marginal effects on the birch forest, but occasionally the population peaks reached outbreak densities which, in the most severe cases, could kill birch stems. If the birches were one-stemmed (monocormic), the entire trees were often killed after such outbreaks and forest recovery was dependent on seedling establishment. In contrast, multi-stemmed (polycormic) trees could recover by producing new basal sprouts. Recovery by sprout production is a much faster and more reliable mechanism of recovery than seedling establishment. The multi-stemmed trees were, thus, more adapted to tolerate and recover from severe outbreaks than the single-stemmed type. Possibly, the multi-stemmed type has evolved as a response to herbivory. The insect outbreaks drive a cyclicity of these forests with more or less regular events of rejuvenation. Other parts of the ecosystems, such as the field layer vegetation and birch fauna, are affected by the birch-moth interaction. For example, after a severe outbreak, the dwarf-shrub heaths that normally dominate the multi-stemmed heath forests are replaced by a vegetation dominated by graminoids.

TI  - Evaluation of pheromone lure of Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera Torticidae) and forecasting its phenological events in Suwon
AB  - The sex pheromone blend (Z8-12ACE8-12ACZ8-12OH=9551) of oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta, was evaluated with reference to its male attractivity at different dosage and lure longevity of 1.0 mg under field conditions (Suwon, Korea Republic). Degree-days (DD) were also calculated up to major phenological events of G. molesta using seasonal adult flights monitored by pheromone traps and egg population densities in early season in Suwon peach orchards. In the range of 0.1- to 4.0-mg dosage examined, G. molesta males caught in pheromone trap decreased with increasing total pheromone doses. The highest number of G. molesta males were attracted in traps baited with 0.1-mg lure, and there were no significant differences among the 0.5- to 4.0-mg lures. In a longevity test with a 1.0-mg lure, there was no difference in mean numbers of G. molesta males caught between traps with fresh-baited lures every 20 days and field-lasted lures up to ~50 days after trap installation, but thereafter more G. molesta males were attracted in the field-lasted lures than in the fresh-baited lures. Accumulated degree-days (DD) from 1 January to the first adult emergence (biofix) were 39DD at a lower threshold temperature 8.1C. Degree-days from the biofix up to the first adult peak through 4th peak were 98DD, 620DD, 1233DD, and 1916DD, respectively. Required degree-days from the first adult peak to the first egg peak were 130DD, while the 2nd egg peak timing was simultaneous with the 2nd adult peak. Management strategies of G. molesta in peach orchards are discussed.

TI  - Geostatistical methods were applied to obtain some maps of spatial dispersion in a tomato field of Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) catches, monitored with 112 sex pheromone traps. / Tcnicas geoestadsticas aplicadas al anlisis de la distribucin de capturas de Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) mediante trampas con feromonas sexuales en una plantacin de tomate
AB  - From 10 to 31 July and from 14 to 17 August, just before and some days after picking tomato fruits, respectively, monitoring of H. armigera catches was carried out to design a pattern of spatial variation in densities, behavioural response to pheromone emissions, and moth population. The sex pheromones used were (Z)-11-hexadecenol and (Z)-9-hexadecenol at a ratio of 973. Information representing the daily spatial distribution of male moth catches was obtained by geostatistical estimation method, i.e. kriging. A series of maps for the analysis of the temporal evolution of the catches was developed. Theoretical models of spherical or exponential variograms showed how the density of catches is variable in all the fields. Some acceptable variograms were produced, and these provided the best estimation at the points where no data were found. Monitoring maps were developed as a geographical information system command. With this information, a design of sex pheromone trap distribution in the fields was developed to be used for the observation of moth flight. These integrated pest management techniques could improve integrated pest control.

TI  - Spatial analysis of an outbreak of Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in the southwest of Western Australia does logging, vegetation type or fire influence outbreaks?
AB  - There was an outbreak of gumleaf skeletoniser (GLS, Uraba lugens) in the southern jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in Western Australia during 1982-1988. Aerial and observational survey data were used in a geographic information system analysis of the possible impact of forest management practices on this insect. In addition, this allowed investigation of the influence of vegetation type on the distribution of GLS. A total area of 6.7 million ha was interrogated, including 89 900 ha of land infested with GLS. Neither logging nor controlled burning induced increases in GLS populations. However, a decrease in area infested with GLS was indicated for controlled burning up to 3 years prior to the outbreak. Interrogation of vegetation complexes indicated that the GLS outbreak was initiated on marginal jarrah forest on poorly drained sites that are prone to inundation in winter and drought in summer. In addition, bivoltine GLS populations were discovered on the fringes of the southern jarrah forest during the observational surveys. This supports the hypothesis that bivoltine GLS were more prevalent in the southern jarrah forest during the outbreak as opposed to univoltine GLS during non-outbreak periods.

TI  - Density-dependent prophylaxis and condition-dependent immune function in Lepidopteran larvae a multivariate approach
AB  - The risk of parasitism and infectious disease is expected to increase with population density as a consequence of positive density-dependent transmission rates. Therefore, species that encounter large fluctuations in population density are predicted to exhibit plasticity in their immune system, such that investment in costly immune defences is adjusted to match the probability of exposure to parasites and pathogens (i.e. density-dependent prophylaxis). Despite growing evidence that insects in high-density populations show the predicted increase in resistance to certain pathogens, few studies have examined the underlying alteration in immune function. As many of these species show increased cuticular melanism at high densities, the aim of this study was to use a multivariate approach to quantify relative variation in the allocation of resources to immunity associated with both rearing density (solitary vs. crowded) and cuticular colour (pale vs. dark) in a phase-polyphenic Lepidopteran species (Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval). Relative to pale individuals, dark larvae (the high-density phenotype) exhibited higher haemolymph and cuticular phenoloxidase [catechol oxidase] (PO) activity and a stronger melanotic encapsulation response to an artificial parasite inserted into the haemocoel. However, they also exhibited lower antibacterial (lysozyme-like) activity than pale larvae. Larval density per se had little effect on most of the immune parameters measured, though capsule melanization and antibacterial activity were significantly higher in solitary-reared than crowded larvae. Correcting for variation in larval body condition, as estimated by weight and haemolymph protein levels, had little effect on these results, suggesting that variation in immune function across treatment groups cannot be explained by condition-dependence. These results are examined in relation to pathogen resistance, and the possibility of a trade-off within the immune system is discussed.

TI  - Population dynamics of oriental fruit moth in peach and plum orchards. / Dinmica populacional da mariposa oriental em pomares de pessegueiro e ameixeira
AB  - An experiment was conducted to study the population dynamics of oriental fruit moth (Grapholita molesta) in peach and plum orchards. Adults were monitored in two peach and one plum orchards for five years (1994-99). The equivalent time series of maximum and minimum temperatures were correlated to the population fluctuation data to verify the correspondence between pest occurrence and temperature fluctuations. A Fourier analysis of the moth time series revealed cyclic dynamics, with a main average period of 53.91 weeks. A mean short period of 7.45 weeks was also obtained, as well as approximations to the mean pest generation time. The power spectrum analysis of the time series, with and without the main periodicity, revealed that G. molesta population dynamics had one regular component characterized by the observed periods, and one irregular component, reminiscent of 1/f noise, characterized by the apparently irregular amplitude oscillations in the insect occurrence. The combination of components generated a process in the low frequency domain, consistent with noisy periodic dynamic. The pest cycles occurred in phase with the maximum and minimum temperature fluctuations.

TI  - Remarkable records of Microlepidoptera in Sweden during 2003. / Anmrkningsvrda fynd av smfjrilar (Microlepidoptera) i Sverige 2003
AB  - The series of annual compilations of remarkable records of Microlepidoptera is continued for the 31th year. The winter started early with snow in Scania already on 19th October (2002) but then continued more as usually in south Sweden with mild weather, except in February, when hard frost on snowless ground occurred occasionally. Spring arrived at normal time but was rapidly followed by summer weather throughout June-August. The summer was unusually warm and dry, though not as extreme as in 2002. However, the moth supply diminished rapidly already in July which is difficult to explain. Possibly the weather was too fine. Most miners were also more or less absent during the autumn, following the decline previous year, but with remarkable local exceptions. Again the winter appeared early with -10C at Kristianstad already on 24th October and this month was even colder than the following November. In spite of the cold spell, larvae and pupae of Phyllonorycter platani had survived in their mines. Two species are reported new to Sweden Cameraria ohridella found as numerous mines, and Herpetogramma licarsisalis, collected already in 2000. The unknown Monochroa species (reported by Svensson 2000) has to be deleted. At present 1689 species of Microlepidoptera are known from Sweden.

A range of species acts as a host to the insect, e.g. wild cherry Cerasus avium [Prunus avium], domestic and wild apple Malus domestica [Malus pumila], M. sylvestris and common pear Pyrus communis as well as members of the genus Crataegus and Sorbus. The incidence of the pest was monitored at several sites in and around Lublin in 1996-98; between 20 and 60 individual larvae were collected per untreated tree, whilst very limited numbers were found in orchards sprayed with insecticides. The presence of the insect did not seem to cause noticeable commercial loss.

TI  - Relative abundance of noctuids (Lepidoptera) associated with cotton and other crops in Haryana
AB  - The prevalence of important noctuids associated with cotton and other crops grown in arid Haryana (India) was ascertained through light trap catches during two consecutive years (1996 and 1997). Out of 19 species observed, Helicoverpa armigera outnumbered all others, whereas Parallelia torrida was the least abundant. The population of Agrotis flammatra [Ochropleura flammatra], A. ipsilon, H. armigera, H. assulta, Spodoptera exigua, S. litura attained peak twice, i.e. in March-April and September-November. The other species, namely Achaea janata, Anomis flava, Earias insulana, E. vittella, Mythimna loreyi, M. unipuncta, P. torrida had peak in October; Grammodes stolida in August-September; while Autographa nigrisigna and Thysanoplusia orichalcea were most abundant during April. Sesamia inferens and Spirama retorta were relatively most abundant during August and September, respectively.

TI  - Second, late summer flight peak of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbner) in south area of Hungary
AB  - The investigations were induced by the controversial question of the generation number of European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) in Hungary. Relying on the data of a nation-wide light trap network, surveys were made in 3 places in a southern area of Hungary (Fadd, Kecel, Kiskunflegyhza) in maize fields of previous years which had been left unharvested. The survey was conducted by cutting 4100 infested stalks to settle the question of a second flight peak. Beside the mentioned places, 480 stalks were cut in current year maize fields in order to determine the larval stages. The examinations were conducted between 6 and 8 August in accordance with the second flight peak. In the previous year's stalks, dead larvae and chrysalises were found without exception, while the examination results of current year's stalks confirmed the development of a second (first summer) generation in this area. It is thus regarded as a fact supported by the data of the national light trap system that in South-East Hungary a true second generation has for years been developing.

TI  - Interactions between growth, herbivory and long-term foliar dynamics of Scots pine
AB  - It is generally thought that carbon-limited conifers with low priority stem growth investment will suffer significantly reduced wood formation following defoliation by insects, as long as resource sinks (apical buds and young needles) are unaffected compared to sources (mature needles). We examined the long-term consequences of periodic defoliation by a moth (Bupalus piniaria L.) on the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), by retrospectively determining annual rates of needle retention using the needle trace method, and comparing these rates with patterns of radial growth obtained by tree-ring analysis. Cumulative moth densities in the current and previous year had the strongest negative influence on subsequent tree growth. Radial and volume increments were reduced substantially (by up to 50%) for 2-3 years after peaks in the moth population. In turn, tree growth was positively correlated with needle retention, with better growth promoting better retention in the following two seasons. This dominant relationship masked the more subtle impact of B. piniaria on needle retention. However, when each needle cohort was examined separately, it was possible to detect the immediate effects of B. piniaria on the loss of the youngest (0 to 1-year-old) needle cohort. Needle budgeting differed for trees in two study compartments, where the rate of tree growth was evidently different. In the compartment where trees grew more slowly they retained a greater number of needle sets over time by shedding fewer of the older needles, but they responded more quickly to the negative effects of the defoliator by losing needles more rapidly in years when the defoliator was abundant.

TI  - Density-dependent shoot-borer herbivory increases the age of first reproduction and mortality of neotropical tree saplings
AB  - Shoot herbivory by the sapling specialist shoot-borer Cromarcha stroudagnesia (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae, Chrysauginae) is shown to have large direct and indirect effects on the rates of height increment and mortality of saplings of its host tree, Tabebuia ochracea (Bignoniaceae), in the secondary successional tropical dry forests of the Area de Conservacin Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Experiments and field observations over 3-4 years show a substantial reduction in sapling height increments due to C. stroudagnesia herbivory, of equivalent magnitude to the difference in height increments between undamaged saplings in canopy gaps and full understorey shade. Extrapolating this data at average amounts of C. stroudagnesia herbivory increases the duration of the pre-reproductive sapling life stage by about 40% relative to undamaged plants. This is an underestimate, as top shoot herbivory by C. stroudagnesia also increased the probability of canopy gap saplings being overtopped and shaded by surrounding vegetation. Sapling mortality was increased by C. stroudagnesia herbivory, with 11.8% of the most heavily damaged young saplings dying in 3 years while no undamaged saplings died. Cromarcha stroudagnesia herbivory strongly increases with the number of conspecific T. ochracea saplings and the number of conspecific shoots within 50 m of focal saplings. It is therefore likely to disproportionately decrease the number of saplings and rate of recruitment to reproductive age in areas of high conspecific sapling density. These results suggest that sapling herbivory, especially herbivory of terminal meristems, has an important but largely unexplored influence on the population dynamics of tropical tree species. They further demonstrate that sapling herbivory by insects, in addition to the well-studied insect predation and herbivory of seedlings, is likely to influence tree species coexistence in tropical forests.

TI  - Influence of weather factors on the activity of rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee)
AB  - Studies on the rice leaf folder population dynamics conducted in rice fields in New Delhi, India during June to November from 1997 to 2000 revealed that the moth numbers were higher in the month of October, exhibiting peak activity in the first week, followed by September. Correlation studies between light trap and net sweep collection with weather parameters on population build up showed that maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity in the morning were highly significant. Maximum and minimum temperatures had negative impact on population build up. However, the RH in the morning had a positive impact on population build up. The correlation between net sweep and light trap collection was very high (0.866), showing that either of them was enough to monitor the leaf folder population under field conditions.

TI  - Evaluating legume species as alternative trap crops to chickpea for management of Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in central Queensland cotton cropping systems
AB  - Mounting levels of insecticide resistance within Australian Helicoverpa spp. populations have resulted in the adoption of non-chemical IPM control practices such as trap cropping with chickpea, Cicer arietinum (L.). However, a new leaf blight disease affecting chickpea in Australia has the potential to limit its use as a trap crop. Therefore this paper evaluates the potential of a variety of winter-active legume crops for use as an alternative spring trap crop to chickpea as part of an effort to improve the area-wide management strategy for Helicoverpa spp. in central Queensland's cotton production region. The densities of Helicoverpa eggs and larvae were compared over three seasons on replicated plantings of chickpea, Cicer arietinum (L.), field pea Pisum sativum (L), vetch, Vicia sativa (L.) and faba bean, Vicia faba (L.). Of these treatments, field pea was found to harbour the highest densities of eggs. A partial life table study of the fate of eggs oviposited on field pea and chickpea suggested that large proportions of the eggs laid on field pea suffered mortality due to dislodgment from the plants after oviposition. Plantings of field pea as a replacement trap crop for chickpea under commercial conditions confirmed the high level of attractiveness of this crop to ovipositing moths. The use of field pea as a trap crop as part of an area-wide management programme for Helicoverpa spp. is discussed.

TI  - A study on correlation between abiotic factors and incidence of tomato fruit borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - A study on the correlation between abiotic factors and incidence of tomato fruit borer was conducted in different locations (Thummalahalli, Singasandra, Kaiwara, Kembodi, Seethi and Kannur) in Chintamani and Kolar districts in Karnataka, India in 1998. Fortnightly counts of egg and larval populations were taken on selected plants from central rows of each plot from preflowering stage. After fruit formation, fruits were examined for larval presence. The egg and larval populations of Helicoverpa armigera varied in different locations. It attained a peak in March-April, and the population declined in October-November. A similar trend in larval population was observed at the different localities. For Thummalahalli, Singasandra and Kembodi, the number of eggs per plant and larvae per plant were highest in March. For Kaiwara and Kannur, the number of eggs per plant was highest in March, but the number of larvae per plant was highest in April. Seethi had the highest number of eggs per plant and larvae per plant in April. Highly significant positive correlations existed between egg and larval populations with the maximum and minimum temperatures for Singasandra, Kaiwara, Kembodi, Seethi and Kannur. For Thummalahalli, a highly significant positive correlation existed between the egg and larval populations with the maximum and minimum temperatures and the total number of rainy days.

TI  - Effects of growing Bt-maize on non target organisms lepidopteran larvae in weed strips. / Auswirkungen des Anbaus von Bt-Mais auf Nichtzielorganismen Schmetterlingslarven in Unkrautstreifen
AB  - Biosafety research needs to evaluate potential side effects of the cultivation of genetically modified Bt-maize on nontarget lepidopteran larvae living in accompanying vegetation. In our experimental approach, we conducted a 2-year trial (2001 and 2002) on a 6-ha field in Germany. Three treatments were used (i) isogenic control variety without insecticide (control), (ii) isogenic control cultivar with chemical insecticide (Baythroid [cyfluthrin]) and (iii) Bt-maize expressing the recombinant toxin. We layed out a weed strip (201 m) in every plot consisting of a Chenopodium album/Sinapis alba mixture. We estimated diversity and abundance of lepidopteran larvae during maize bloom and pollen shed. C. album hosted 5 species but all in very low densities. S. alba hosted 11 species. The most abundant were Plutella xylostella and different Pieris species. In both years, maize flowering and larval development stages barely overlapped. No differences were detected between Bt-treatment and the control, but the chemical insecticide treatment reduced larval abundance significantly. Conclusions regarding experimental methodology and results are discussed in regard to environmental monitoring of GMOs.

TI  - Excrement-based characterisation of changes in abundances of pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea Den. et Schiff.) larvae in selected stands of the Tuczno Forest District in the years 1999-2002. / Charakterystyka zmian liczebnoci larw strzygoni choinwki (Panolis flammea Den. et Schiff.) na podstawie opadu ekskrementw, w wybranych drzewostanach Nadlenictwa Tuczno, w latach 1999-2002
AB  - The mass occurrence of pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea) in forest stands has been noted in many parts of Poland and the prognoses point out to the threat of pandemic outbreaks of this species. Considering this scenario, the monitoring of occurrences of larvae of this foliophage was carried out in the Tuczno Forest District in the years 1999-2002. Occurrences of larvae during their feeding activity were additionally monitored in 2001 and 2002 to assess the level of infestation of stands by larvae, changes in their densities in tree crowns and the rates of their growth and development. Observations carried out in 2001 and 2002 showed significant changes in densities of larvae in crowns during their feeding activity. The occurrence of pine beauty moth larvae was observed almost in every fragment of the studied stands with densities of larvae in crowns changing from year to year. The highest excrement mass values were recorded in the third decade of June and first decade of July. In 2002, the densities of larvae in crowns were lower and changes in densities during the feeding activity were less dynamic than in 2001. Moreover, the development of larvae was more rapid and the size of frass suggested that towards the end of their development they attained greater sizes than in 2001. The study confirmed the occurrence of larvae in centres as typical for the between-outbreak period.

TI  - Chickpea cultivation in rice-growing area of Punjab Province of Pakistan potential and constraints
AB  - A 2-member team of pulses agronomists from the National Agricultural research Centre, Islamabad, Pakistan, with financial help of the rice-wheat project conducted an informal exploratory survey from 23 February to 1 March 2003 of 5 major rice-growing districts of Punjab. Overall, ~50 experienced farmers and personnel of the Departments of Agriculture Extension and Adaptive Research in these districts were interviewed to determine the present status of chickpea in rice-growing area and existing chickpea-based cropping systems, and explore possibilities for the reintroduction of chickpea cultivation in rice-wheat cropping system. The results show that there is very little scope of pulses in irrigated agriculture in general and that of chickpea in particular. Farmers grow chickpea on limited scale only in drought years as a temporary intervention. Few farmers grow chickpea and sell the green pods and earn a sizeable income. Farmers adopt rotations involving pea, potato, onion, fodder and off-season cucumber. Introduction of chickpea in the area requires a strong policy by the provincial government highlighting its economics through training programmes and publicity on television and radio. There is hardly any prospect of relay cropping chickpea in rice as hard paddy fields and dense crop stand hinder germination and emergence. Similarly, if chickpea is sown in the rice-wheat rotation, the next rice crop cannot be planted due to late maturity of this crop. The major constraints of chickpea cultivation are (1) high weed infestation; (2) high insect (pod borer [?Helicoverpa armigera]) attack; (3) wet conditions and poor drainage of the soil due to clayey nature; (4) excessive vegetative growth followed by less pod bearing; and (5) more income from rice and wheat, which are high-yielding and safer crops. Recommendations are outlined.

TI  - Implementing of an IPM programme for vegetable brassicas in New Zealand
AB  - In New Zealand, increasing levels of resistance in diamondback moth (DBM) to recommended synthetic pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides were monitored for five years in vegetable Brassica crops until in 1997 they were associated with control failures in three regions. Subsequently, Crop & Food Research initiated a two-year IPM implementation programme with financial assistance from government and industry, including agrochemical companies. The IPM programme emphasizes the use of a reduced spray programme developed in the early 1990s based on a crop scouting system using presence/absence per plant of the major pests and a proven action threshold for cabbage. Further research has reconfirmed this cabbage action threshold, and broccoli and cauliflower action thresholds have been developed. The implementation phase involved training scouts and crop managers in insect identification and crop scouting techniques, and incorporated an accreditation system for trainees and a crop management recording system to document insecticide use in the IPM crops. Demonstration sites in three of the main Brassica growing regions were used for grower field days and to compare IPM practices with conventional pest management. Levels of resistance in DBM to the commonly used groups of insecticides were monitored and resistance levels were compared within a region as well as between regions. The IPM programme also recommends an insecticide resistance management rotation strategy with different chemical groups assigned to two different seasonal windows as well as the preferential use of selective insecticides to preserve natural enemies. An independent survey in November 2001 reported that 80% of growers in the main Brassica-growing region were using IPM and 96% were using crop scouting. Crop management records from IPM crops show an average saving of at least 50% in insecticide use compared with conventional crops.

TI  - Use of ethyl and propyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoates in codling moth management improved monitoring in Bartlett pear with high dose lures
AB  - The propyl and ethyl esters of (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoic acid were evaluated in gray halobutyl septa as kairomone lures for both sexes of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). All studies were conducted in 'Bartlett' pear orchards with moderate to high codling moth adult population densities and treated with sex pheromone dispensers for mating disruption. Variable results were obtained with kairomone loading experiments. Increasing the lure loading to 40.0 mg of either the ethyl or propyl ester significantly increased male and total moth catch in separate experiments. However, in other tests with the ethyl ester no difference was found in total moth catch in traps baited with 0.1, 1.0, 3.0 or 10.0 mg versus 40.0 mg lures. The 40.0 mg ethyl and propyl ester lures were both more effective than a 3.0 mg ethyl ester lure and comparable to a sex pheromone lure in detecting the beginning of codling moth flight in the spring generation. No difference was found in moth catch between 40.0 mg propyl and ethyl ester lures. Significantly more females were caught in traps baited with 1.0-10.0 mg than with 1.0-100.0 g lures loaded with the ethyl ester. In general, kairomone lures caught significantly fewer moths than sex pheromone lures.

TI  - Ranking of individual mountain birch trees in terms of leaf chemistry seasonal and annual variation
AB  - The quality of tree leaves as food for herbivores changes rapidly especially during the spring and early summer. However, whether the quality of an individual tree in relation to other trees in the population changes during the growing season and between years is less clear. We studied the seasonal and annual stability of chemical and physical traits affecting mountain birch (Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii) leaf quality for herbivores (Epirrita autumnata, Lagopus lagopus, Rangifer tarandus and Lepus timidus) in northern Finland. Rankings of trees in terms of the contents of two major groups of phenolics in their leaves, hydrolyzable tannins and proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins), were very stable from the early spring to the end of the growing season. There were also strong positive within-season correlations in the levels of some other groups of phenolics in the leaves (kaempferol glycosides, myricetin glycosides and p-coumaroylquinic acid derivatives). The contents of individual sugars and the sum content of protein-bound amino acids showed patterns of seasonal consistency in mature leaves, but not in young developing leaves. The seasonal correlations in leaf water content and toughness were also strongest in mature leaves. The correlations between two years at corresponding times of the growing season were strongly positive for the major groups of phenolics throughout the season, but were more variable for the contents of proteins and some sugars. Leaf toughness and water content showed strong positive correlations in mature leaves. Despite the consistency of tree ranking in terms of leaf phenolics, the relative resistance status of trees may, however, change during a growing season because there was a negative correlation between the content of hydrolyzable tannins (early-season resistance compounds) in leaves early in the season and the content of proanthocyanidins (late-season resistance compounds) late in the season, and vice versa. Thus, assuming that phenolics affect herbivore preference and performance, different plants may suffer damage at different times of the growing season, and the overall variation between trees in the fitness consequences may be low. In addition, the adaptation of herbivorous insects to mountain birch foliage in general, as well as to specific tree individuals, may be constrained by variation in the relative resistance status of the trees.

TI  - Evaluation of presence-absence sampling plans for the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) (Lepidoptera Plutellidae)
AB  - Two sets of sequential presence-absence sampling plans for the management of diamondback moth (DBM) were developed and evaluated, one for the classification of levels of the proportions of plants infested with larvae and the other for the classification of levels of larval density. The action thresholds investigated were 0.15, 0.25, 0.35 and 0.45 for proportion-based sampling plans and 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 larvae/plant for density-based sampling plans. Under the proportion-based sampling plans, the expected correct decision rates were 95% for 86-87% of all possible population levels and the expected average sample size was 50 plants for 73-87% of all possible population levels. Re-sampling analyses showed average sample sizes of &lt;40 plants in reaching the 95% accuracy. For density-based sampling plans, an empirical proportion-density model was first established. The resulting model was highly significant (P&lt;0.001) and explained 97% of the total variation in the independent variable. Satisfactory performance (95% accuracy at 50 plants sample size) of the density-based sampling plans can be expected when the true population density does not lie in the vicinity of the action threshold. In conclusion, the sequential binomial sampling plans presented here can be used effectively in the monitoring of DBM populations for decision making.

TI  - Emergence of overwintered larvae of eye-spotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in relation to temperature and apple tree phenology at Summerland, British Columbia
AB  - We recorded daily appearance of overwintered larvae of eye-spotted bud moth (ESBM), Spilonota ocellana (Denis & Schiffermller) in spring 1992, 1994, and 1996 in an un-sprayed apple orchard at Summerland, British Columbia, to relate larval emergence to degree-day (DD) accumulation and apple phenology. In all years the first larva was found between mid-March and early April, and none appeared after late April. Median emergence of larvae occurred when McIntosh apple trees were at early, tight-cluster stage of fruit-bud development. Larval head capsule measurements showed that ESBM usually overwinter as fifth and sixth instars, with a small proportion (6%) as fourth-instar larvae. In the laboratory we monitored emergence of non-diapausing overwintered larvae from apple branches incubated at 8.8, 9.4, 12.9, 15.0, 18.0, and 20.9C. A least-squares linear regression described emergence over this temperature range relatively accurately (r2=0.57, P&lt;0.05) and a base temperature for emergence (Tb=1.0C0.6) was extrapolated from this regression. Regression analysis indicated median emergence should require 154.66.7 DD above 1C (DD1C). Using daily air-temperature maxima and minima and 1 March to start accumulating DD1C, the error between predicted and observed days to median emergence in the field was -6.73.1 d; the regression model predicted early in every case. Using observed larval appearance on apples (1992, 1994, & 1996) and an iterative process, we determined that a combination of 6C as the Tb and 1 January as a date to start accumulating DD6C, minimized the coefficient of variation for the three-year mean DD6C accumulations (82.73.5 DD6C) required for 50% of the larvae to appear in the field. While this latter DD index described observed emergence of larvae accurately, and its use may help improve management of ESBM, it should be validated using independent data before growers use it routinely.

TI  - Impact of defoliation by the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) on radial, height and volume growth of Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia) trees in Turkey
AB  - An outbreak of the pine processionary moth (PPM; T. pityocampa) began in spring 1998 and lasted 5 years in a Pinus brutia (Calabrian pine) stand. Tree volume and volume elements increments were examined throughout a PPM outbreak cycle from 1981 to 2003 in an even aged, pure, undisturbed, young Calabrian pine stand in Isparta, Turkey. Tree ring chronologies of the control Calabrian pine, which was not defoliated by PPM during 1998-2003, were used to estimate potential growth characteristics in the host Calabrian pine (moderate and high defoliation groups) for current and past outbreaks. Increment cores were collected from 70 host and 78 control dominant or co-dominant trees, and annual radial growth indices from 1981-2003 were calculated for each defoliation group in a 41-point sampling. Growth functions were defined as the cumulative sum of radial, height and volume increments, and graphically compared between host Calabrian pine (3 moderate and one high), 4 control Calabrian pine, and one host Crimean pine (P. nigra) sample trees. At least 3 severe outbreak periods were identified (from 1981-86, 1992-97 and 1998-2003), and much of the study area being severely affected by PPM. Tree ring evidence suggested that large-scale (in 1981, 1992 and 1998) and partial (in 1988) outbreaks occurred in the study area. Negative inflections of host radial growth curves relative to the control height and volume indicated PPM activity. The periodic average diameter growth reductions (in %) in 1981, 1988, 1992 and 1998, respectively, were 0, 13, 5 and 0 for the control; 12, 8, 7 and 2 for the moderate-defoliation group; and 18, 5, 0 and 7 for high-defoliation group. The outbreaks appeared to be associated with dry winter and spring weather prior to autumn and winter when feeding occurs.

TI  - Impact of repeated applications of alpha-cypermethrin on Eldana saccharina (LepidopteraPyralidae) and on arthropods associated with sugarcane
AB  - In five field-scale insecticide trials conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during 2001, the repeated application of the synthetic pyrethroid -cypermethrin to carry-over cane reduced damage caused by the sugarcane borer E. saccharina. The insecticide was applied with mistblowers at 200 ml formulation/ha in 350 litres of water/ha once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, commencing when the crop was 6 to 9 months old. At harvest, average damage and larval numbers were reduced by 72 and 73%, respectively. The estimated recoverable crystal percentage in cane increased by an average of 28%. Arthropods were monitored in 2 of the trials by pitfall trapping. The treatment significantly affected arthropod abundance and diversity, primarily during the period of insecticide application; however, at crop harvest, 5 months after the last application, no significant effect was observed. The impact on ants, considered important predators of eldana, was similar. It is concluded that this approach to suppressing borer infestations may have commercial value.

TI  - Study on European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn.) on different corn hybrids in Gorika region. / Preuevanje koruzne vee (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn.) na razlinih hibridih koruze na Gorikem
AB  - The European corn borer (O. nubilalis) has been known as a pest of maize in Gorika region, Slovenia. During 1996-1998, more intensive studies of the pest were performed. Bionomics was monitored by light traps placed in maize fields. Moths were caught from the beginning of May until the end of September. Moths caught in the traps were counted daily. During 1996-1997, infestation on some hybrids of different FAO groups was monitored. In the experiment, 3 hybrids of FAO groups 400, 500, 600 and 700 were observed. Before harvesting, 60 plants were chosen randomly and examined. Damage on plants and ears, and the number of the caterpillars in maize stalks were evaluated. The results revealed that the European corn borer has 2 generations per year in this region, and the intensity of infestation highly depended on weather conditions. The extent of damages or percentage of infestation varied among the hybrids and FAO groups, and with pest population density.

TI  - Oviposition traps to survey eggs of Lambdina fiscellaria (Lepidoptera Geometridae)
AB  - Outbreaks of the hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria (Guene), are characterized by rapid increase and patchy distribution over widespread areas, which make it difficult to detect impending outbreaks. This is a major problem with this insect. Population forecasting is based on tedious and expensive egg surveys in which eggs are extracted from 1-m branches; careful observation is needed to avoid counting old unhatched eggs of previous year populations. The efficacy of artificial substrates as oviposition traps to sample hemlock looper eggs was tested as a means of improving outbreak detection and population forecasting. A white polyurethane foam substrate (1 095 lb/ft3) used with the Luminoc insect trap, a portable light trap, was highly efficient in sampling eggs of the hemlock looper. Foam strips placed on tree trunks at breast height were less efficient but easier and less expensive to use for the establishment of extensive survey networks. Estimates based on oviposition traps were highly correlated with those obtained from the 1-m branch extraction method. The oviposition trap is a standard, inexpensive, easy, and robust method that can be used by nonspecialists. This technique makes it possible to sample higher numbers of plots in widespread monitoring networks, which is crucial for improving the management of hemlock looper populations.

TI  - On factors causing outbreak of Spodoptera litura (Fabricius)
AB  - The population dynamics and fluctuation of S. litura were studied using sex pheromone trap and net cover. Alongside this, the factors responsible for the outbreak of the pest in the past 10 years were determined. The authors believe that the increasing area of some economically important crops (mainly vegetable) and protected cultivation provide suitable sites for feeding and overwintering of S. litura. The pest tends to occur earlier than before, which is helpful in building a big population by increasing their original number and generations in the field. The other factors resulting in the pest outbreak may include high temperature and less rainfall in summer, and misuse of pesticides that might kill several natural enemies of this pest.

TI  - Trends in codling moth activity in apple orchards under mating disruption using pheromones in the Elgin area, Western Cape Province, South Africa
AB  - The reliability of decisions regarding spray applications for the control of Cydia pomonella using pheromone trapping in apple orchards (Grogans and Geelbos farms in Elgin, Western Cape Province, South Africa) under mating disruption and in orchards not under mating disruption was evaluated during 1994/95-2000/2001. The long-term trends in C. pomonella activity, pesticide (azinphos-methyl, parathion, chlorpyrifos, phosmet, tau-fenvalerate, fenvalerate, alpha-cypermethrin, flufenoxuron and tebufenozide) use and damage levels in orchards under mating disruption were studied. Decisions regarding spraying in orchards under mating disruption were less reliable than in orchards not under mating disruption (7 and 3% probability of making an incorrect decision, respectively). Codling moth trap catches were reduced after the introduction of mating disruption at the two sites. This was accompanied by a reduction in the number of codling moth spray applications from eight to 3-5 at the first site. At the second site, nine sprays were applied during the season before the use of mating disruption. During the first and second seasons of mating disruption, eight and six applications, respectively, were made to reduce C. pomonella population levels. Thereafter, the number of spray applications specifically for codling moth control varied from 3 to 4. Fruit damage at harvest did not exceed 0.23% on the first site. On the second site, there had been a 30-40% fruit damage prior to mating disruption. This was reduced to 1.02% during the first year after the introduction of mating disruption. Thereafter, it did not exceed 0.58%.

TI  - Shoot borer, Hypsipyla robusta Moore (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) infestation on Chukrasia velutina Wight et Arn. in hilly areas of Bangladesh
AB  - The nature and extent of damage of shoot borer, H. robusta, were studied in 2-8 years old C. velutina plantations in the hilly areas of Chittagong, Bangladesh. A single tree could have attacked several times in the season. Approximately 47% C. velutina trees were found to have attacked at least once in their lifetime. The infestation rate was more pronounced on the hill slopes (56%) than on the valleys (37%). A high number of trees (60%) exhibited recovery trend after the infestation while other trees had formation of fork, cork, knot, curve, twist, whorled branching from the point of infestation (mostly at a height of 2-3 m). Approximately 42% potential biomass production was lost due to the infestation. Some trees were found to show an encouraging 'resistance' against the infestation that referred an ample scope of propagation and plantation in the future for a better inheritance.

TI  - Presence of the olive moth on Lake Garda. / Presenza di tignola dell'olivo sul lago di Garda
AB  - Losses of olives around Lake Garda are attributed to the olive moth Prays oleae. Monitoring at 3 sites at 220, 350 and 460 m above sea level showed the moth to be present at all the sites in each of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 but not in large numbers. Experiments showed that most captures occurred in traps containing 1 mg of pheromone. It was concluded that the damage caused by the moth was not sufficient to justify the use of insecticides.

TI  - Four generations of the vine moth in Veneto. / Nel veneto quattro generazioni di tignoletta della vite
AB  - The vine moth (Lobesia botrana) normally produces 3 generations/year but recently a 4th generation has been recorded in Italy. In 2003 a study of the life cycle in Verona and Padua provinces revealed a 1st generation flying from mid-April to late May, a 2nd from early June to early July, a 3rd from mid-July to mid-August and a 4th from the end of August to mid-October. Comparisons with previous years showed that the 2nd and 3rd generations were flying markedly earlier in 2003, thus giving time for a 4th generation to appear. In 1983, when weather conditions were similar, a 4th generation was suspected but not confirmed. The 2003 study found that the 4th oviposition occurred throughout September. Larvae were found on a few ripe grape bunches during harvest but were mainly on immature bunches which were never harvested. The 4th generation did not cause serious damage to the crop.

TI  - Feasibility of integration of plant resistance with plant population density and mode of insecticide application for the management of maize stem borer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe)
AB  - A field trial was conducted in 1997 and 1998 to investigate the feasibility of integration of plant population and mode of insecticide application with plant resistance in maize borer, C. partellus. A resistant (Antigua Gr.L) and a susceptible cultivar (Pusa Composite-I) were grown at normal (52 800 plant/ha) and high (66 000 plant/ha) population levels. Insecticide treatments included foliar spray of endosulfan 35 EC (0.1%) and whorl application of carbofuran 3G at 1 and 1.25 g per m row, at normal and high population plots, respectively. Lower infestation was observed in the resistant than the susceptible cultivar. Borer damage was higher under high than plant density. The reduction in borer infestation was higher with carbofuran (6.1% infestation) than endosulfan (7.0% infestation). The resistant cultivar showed higher yield than the susceptible one. Carbofuran and endosulfan reduced damage to 3 and 5.6% on Antigua Gr.I, and to 13 and 9.5% on Pusa Composite-I, respectively. Plots with high plant density showed a high spider population (13.44/plot). Carbofuran application reduced the spider population more than endosulfan. Lower spider population was observed on insecticide-treated Pusa Composite-I than untreated plants.

TI  - Recent increase of apple leafminer, Lyonetia prunifoliella (Hbner) on apple orchards in Gyeongbuk Province
AB  - Leaf damage by apple leafminer, Lyonetia prunifoliella, was surveyed on Fuji apple orchards with seedling rootstock from 1992 to 2001 and with M.9 rootstock from 1999 to 2001 in Gyeongbuk Province, Korea Republic. The damage was negligible in apple orchards with seedling rootstock, i.e. 0.15% in 1992 and 0.06% in 1993. However, it sharply increased to more than 3.39% since 1994, reaching peak damage of 6.28 to 7.78% in 1996 to 1998. Damages on apple orchards with M.9 rootstock from 1999 to 2001 were higher, i.e. 6.09 to 15.3%, compared with those with seedling rootstock in the same years. In seedling rootstock apple, the damage was highest in September but in M.9 rootstock apple, the difference was not significant. Leaf damage showed no differences between cultivars including 4 Korean cultivars and Fuji. These results may explain that increase of M.9 rootstock apple orchards is responsible for the recent outbreak of the leafminer in Korea.

TI  - The description of changes in the state of the Notecka Primeval Forest. / Charakterystyka zmian w stanie lasw Puszczy Noteckiej
AB  - A study was conducted to define the trends in changes of indicators used in the assessment of the state of forests and forest management plans of the Notecka Primeval Forest, Poland. Results showed the dynamics of individual tree species occurring in the Notecka Forest. The proportion of Scots pine [Pinus sylvestris] in the forest composition changed in favour of broadleaved species. The analysis of areal share of age classes for oak [Quercus spp.] and beech [Fagus spp.] proved the lack of balance between the share of these species in age classes I-III and IV-VII. The share of oak beech was considerably higher in the oldest than in the youngest age classes. The share of oak and beech in plantations and thickets increased, but in a slow process attributable to specific natural conditions of the Notecka Primeval Forest. In spite of adverse natural conditions, the more thorough recognition of habitats revealed the possibility of attaining higher biological diversity and greater productive capabilities of habitats. The average stand age (53 years) may be considered as the near felling age of the dominant tree species, however the share of age classes was particularly unfavourable. Stands up to 50 years of age occupy only 31% of the area, 51-70 years - 43% and older (71) - 16%. The successive series of forest planning operations showed positive trends in the average growing stock and volume increment of stands when pine stands approach the felling age that established following the outbreak of pine beauty moth [Panolis flammea] in 1922-24 (more than 40% of the Notecka Primeval Forest area). The total harvesting volume from final and intermediate fellings gradually increased to the level of the average increment of the total yield of pine stands (3.5 m3/ha/year). The need for further analysis of the structure of forest functions in the stands belonging to the protective and managed forests is suggested.

TI  - A three-year partial life table study of the stemborer Busseola fusca Fuller (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on sorghum in the highlands Eritrea
AB  - The population dynamics of B. fusca was studied from 1997 to 1999 at Halhale and Halhal Begos, located at altitudes of 1960 and 1850 m above sea level respectively in the highlands of Eritrea. Sorghum was sown in early April in Halhale and late June in Halhal Begos throughout the study period. All agronomic practices recommended for sorghum production in the two areas were followed to ensure good crop stand, except for the application of pesticides. Fifteen generations, nine in Halhale and six in Halhal Begos, were observed. B. fusca had three and two generations per year in Halhale and Halhal Begos, respectively. Peak egg laying at Halhale was in early May, July and early September, while at Halhal Begos it was in July and early September. Stage-specific mortalities of B. fusca were caused by infertility, disappearance (predation by ants and earwigs, lack of suitable host, abiotic factors), residuals and parasitoids. The key mortality factor was disappearance of small larvae (35-66% mortality). The mortality of the other stages was low but had a composite effect on the overall generation mortality. The mortality of small larvae was density-dependent and density-independent at Halhale and Halhal Begos, respectively. The changes in population between generations were due to small larval mortality of B. fusca from one generation to the next. The life table study showed that mortality due to natural factors did not reduce B. fusca population below the damage level. Integrated management strategies are discussed to reduce the damage caused by B. fusca on sorghum.

TI  - Characteristic features of the tortricid fauna (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) of the Thai Nguen Plateau (South Vietnam) and descriptions of new and little known species
AB  - As a result of the field observations in the autumn 1988 in the Gialai Province of South Vietnam, a clear dependence of the tortricid moth activity on weak fluctuations of the air temperature and humidity has been revealed. The evening rise of air temperature by 0.5-1.0C sharply increased the abundance of moths near electric light sources. A new genus Pammenopsis gen. nov. with the type species Eucelis critica [Cydia critica] and 6 new species from other tribes (Drachmobola dentiuncanae sp. nov., Mimeoclysia incompertana sp. nov., Semniotes confinana sp. nov., Sycacantha beatana sp. nov., Sorolopha asymmetrana sp. nov. and Rhopobota svetlanae sp. nov.) are described from South Vietnam. Redescriptions or diagnoses of 12 little known species from Vietnam are given, including that of Dudua aprobola. A new synonymy is established Noduliferola (=Duessa syn. nov.). Four new combinations are proposed Eucosmogastra aeolantha comb. nov.; Noduliferola pleurogramma comb. nov.; Noduliferola atriplaga comb. nov.; Noduliferola phaeostropha comb. nov. All types and other examined specimens are in the Zoological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg.

TI  - Preliminary investigations on the interaction between spiders (Araneae) and grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana (Denis et Schiffermller)) populations in Apulian vineyards
AB  - The relationship between spider population and grapevine moth (L. botrana) infestation were studied in 2000-2001 in an experimental vineyard in Valenzano (Bari), Italy. Spider species composition and seasonal fluctuations in spider population were also investigated. Samples of 50 clusters were collected weekly from each of the two vine cultivars, Italia and Sangiovese, from the onset of vine blooming until vintage. Spiders, grapevine moth larvae and infested berries of each cluster were counted. Spiders were identified up to family, genus or species level based on the developmental stage. From vintage stage until the end of 2001, spider samples were further collected. Grapevine moth flights were also monitored. Approximately 1400 specimens of spiders were collected. The most represented spider families were, in a decreasing order, Clubionidae, Theridiidae, Thomisidae (including Philodromidae), Salticidae, Linyphiidae and Gnaphosidae. These families accounted for more than 90% of the collected spiders. Hunting spiders comprised approximately 70% of the whole spider population. The most frequent species were Cheiracanthium mildei, Theridion melanurum, Philodromus rufus, Icius hamatus and Meioneta rurestris. Significant correlations were established between the population trend of single spider families and grapevine moth flight diagram, indicating that L. botrana was one of the main preys comprising the diet of spiders. Clubionidae, Theridiidae and Thomisidae were the most represented families. On the contrary, the spider population did not show any close relationship with grapevine moth larval infestation. The population trend of spiders was very similar in the two cultivars; thus, revealing the absence of any preference related to cluster colour and compactness. In 2001, almost the same number of spiders was collected from Italia and Sangiovese (approximately 500 spiders per cultivar). The total number of spiders collected from Sangiovese varied between 2000 (approximately 300 spiders throughout the year) and 2001 (approximately 500 spiders); however, the general population trend during the year, on the same cultivar, was basically the same in both years.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution and enumerative sampling of the pink borer, Sesamia cretica Led. (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), in maize fields in Egypt
AB  - Surveys for population densities of the maize borer Sesamia cretica Led. (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) were conducted for three consecutive years (1997-1999) in several localities of the Nile delta in Egypt, in order to get a better insight into the population dynamics of the pest and to propose rational basis for its biocontrol using a recently isolated granulovirus. High population densities (more than one borer per plant) were observed only in the first plantings after winter (first fortnight of April). After this peak, populations almost vanished until the end of the crop season (September-October) when a slight increase was observed (0.1 borer per plant). The drastic decrease in population densities in plantings from the end of April occurs because most final instars of the borer leave the plant to pupate in the soil. This behaviour, uncommon in maize borers, results in a very high mortality rate due mainly to pupal parasitism. Only the few larvae pupating in the stem, which are much less parasitized, give rise to adults. Spatial distribution was studied using Taylor's power laws which enabled the elaboration of enumerative sampling plans for eggs, small larvae (1st and 2nd instars) and older ones. Fixed optimal sample size and sequential sampling plans for different precision levels were developed. The precision of the estimated sample size was checked using resampling of some of the data that were not used to build the models. The validation study showed that the plans were suitable for the entire Nile delta region.

TI  - Relationship between Helicoverpa armigera Hubner and Maruca vitrata (Geyer) abundance, damage and yield loss in short-duration pigeonpeas
AB  - The relationship between abundance of the lepidopteran borers Helicoverpa armigera and Maruca vitrata and damage and yield loss in short-duration pigeon peas was studied in two multilocation trials in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997 rainy seasons at four locations in India Patancheru (Andhra Pradesh), Akola (Maharashtra), Sardarkrishi Nagar (Gujarat) and Vamban (Tamil Nadu). Larval populations of H. armigera and M. vitrata were correlated with pod damage and grain yields. Significant correlation of location, years and genotype on insect population, level of damage and grain yield was obtained. The effect of plant type on lepidopteran pod damage was also observed. The relationships between pod damage, yield and larval population of Helicoverpa and Maruca are discussed.

TI  - The seasonal abundance of the legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, in Kagoshima, Japan
AB  - In 2001, an experiment was undertaken in Kagoshima, Japan, to study the seasonal variation in legume pod borer larval abundance in four legume species (cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), adzuki (V. angularis), soyabean (Glycine max) and red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)). The survey began 20 days after sowing the first set of seeds. Observations were performed weekly and the number of legume pod borers on the plants was recorded until the pest could no longer be found. The seasonal abundance of the larvae was bimodal. Larvae were first observed on 15 June 2001 on cowpea and adzuki plants, but the infestation began earlier than mid-June, because the larvae found were already at the 3rd- or 4th-instar stage. The infestation peaked in mid-July, when more than 90% of cowpea and adzuki flowers were infested. A second, smaller peak occurred in mid-October. The larvae were present until 16 November. From mid-August to September, no larva was found on any of the legume plants. A six-fold increase in insect abundance was observed between the first and second generations in the field (59 on 21 June; and 350 on 17 July). The cowpea and adzuki plants were more severely attacked than the soyabean and kidney bean plants. There was a distinct correlation between insect infestation and trichome density. Most of the larvae were found on flowers and flower buds. The larvae often formed webbing between flower buds and leaves, especially on adzuki plants that were sown in May.

TI  - Seasonal occurrence of smaller clearwing moth, Synanthedon tenuis in sweet persimmon orchards
AB  - The seasonal occurrence of smaller clearwing moth (S. tenuis) was monitored with sex pheromone traps in sweet persimmon orchards in Gimhae and Jinju (Korea Republic) in 1998, 2001, and 2002. Results indicated that it occurred in two generations a year. The first generation of the moth occurred from mid-May to early July, and the second one from late July to late September, showing the peaks in early June and early to mid-August, respectively.

TI  - Modeling the changes in the population growth patterns of pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.)
AB  - For three successive cotton-growing seasons (1996-98) in Egypt, the changes in the population density of P. gossypiella were monitored. In modelling the changes in population growth patterns, the number of male moths of P. gossypiella was considered based on pheromone trap catches. The results revealed that P. gossypiella, after emerging from the diapausing stage, underwent two distinct broods; the first had two generations, while the second possessed 4-5 overlapping field generations. The 2 generations of the first brood emerged during mid-April until mid-June and proved to be suicidal since the fruiting structures suitable for infestation were not available. The 4 generations of the second brood extended from early June to the end of December. The number and duration of generations were estimated based on both the zero of development (11.97C) and the accumulated thermal units needed for completing one generation (487 day-degrees). The present field and laboratory studies introduce valuable information establishing a profitable model when adopting integrated pest management programmes.

TI  - Hibernation and seasonal occurrence of the cotton caterpillar, Palpita indica (Lepidoptera Pyralidae), in watermelon
AB  - The population density of the Cotton caterpillar, P. indica [Diaphania indica] larvae was gradually increased until 10 October and then decreased rapidly after that time at the watermelon culture of rain sheltered house. After 15th October, many larvae went to soil and molted to pupae for the hibernation. Most of pupae were found in pF 2.4 soil moisture condition, but none in pF 1.5 hydromorphic soil. Most of the pupae were found below 5 cm and there was no pupa below 10 cm from the soil surface. The sex ratio of the overwintering pupae was 1.091.00. For the monitoring of the cotton caterpillar adults using sex pheromone compounds, different mixture ratios of each pheromone compound were investigated with (E)-11-hexadecenal and (E, E)-10, 12-hexadecadienal. Seven versus three ratio of (E)-11-hexadecenal and (E, E)-10, 12-hexadecadienal was more attractive than any other ratio, and then followed by 64, 82, 91, and 55 mixtures. As a result of monitoring with 73 mixture of (E)-11-hexadecenal and (E, E)-10, 12-hexadecadienal, occurrence peaks of cotton caterpillar adults showed 4 times per year. The first time of adult appearance was late July in 2000 and middle July in 2001 and the highest number was collected on late September.

TI  - Dynamics of codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) incidence in orchards of various agrotechnical conditions
AB  - The population dynamics of the codling moth, C. pomonella in a conventional or protected apple orchard in Poland was investigated and the extent of the damage it causes in apple cultivars Cortland and Idared was determined. The close location of orchards to natural sources of pests and existing zones that limits the migration of the pests enhanced the expansion of the pests. The number of male insects was higher in the traditional than the protected orchard. Mass flight of moths of the overwintering generation was observed under a sum of effective temperature of 168C, whereas that of the first generation was observed at the sum of effective temperature of 643C. Idared recorded higher crop damage than Cortland.

TI  - Short-term indirect interactions between two moth (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) species mediated by shared parasitoids the benefit of being scarce
AB  - Despite the impact of parasitoids on insect populations being extensively studied, indirect parasitoid-mediated effects remain rarely documented in natural communities. We examined the influence of shared parasitoids on the interactions between two functionally monophagous moths, Nonagria typhae and Archanara sparganii. The moths showed a considerable variation in terms of relative abundance and the degree of phenological synchrony between the species. On average, parasitism levels caused by shared parasitoids did not differ between the two host species. Relative parasitism levels of the two hosts, however, varied considerably among different samples. Percentage parasitism of the scarcer species, A. sparganii, thus could not be fully explained by that of the dominant species, N. typhae. The results indicated that A. sparganii may benefit from the presence of N. typhae. In particular, both low relative density as well as high phenological synchrony with N. typhae reduced parasitism levels in A. sparganii. The case thus indicates the presence of parasitoid-mediated indirect effects between the coexisting herbivores. The patterns of host use observed in this study are consistent with the scenario of frequency-dependent host use caused by changes in parasitoid behaviour. Such a host use by parasitoids is suggested to promote numerical stability and coexistence of the moth species in the system studied.

TI  - Evaluation of two commercial sex pheromone lures for monitoring males of pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella and spiny bollworm, Earias insulana in Egypt
AB  - Two commercial sex pheromone lures were evaluated for monitoring pink bollworm (PBW) males, Pectinophora gossypiella and spiny bollworm (SPW), Earias insulana during the cotton growing season of 2000, in a 7.5 acre cotton fiels in Fayoum Governorate, Egypt. Pheromone traps were placed at 100-m intervals along sown rows. Males captured by the traps were recorded every 3 days from 11 June to 7 September. PBW Xlure90 lures (containing a 11 ratio of Z,Z-7,11-hexadecadienyl acetate and Z,E-7,11-hexadecadienyl acetate) accurately detected the June activity peak (11 moths captured every 3 days per trap), but recorded lower catches for July and August moth activity peaks compared to population densities recorded in the past in other Governorates where other sex pheromone dispensers have been evaluated. Traps baited with SBW Xlure90 (containing E,E-10,12- hexadecadienyl aldehyde) caught few moths throughout the evaluation period, despite the expectation of considerable SBW population pressure based on previous studies. Chemical analysis showed that PBW dispensers have high release rates in the beginning, which gradually decrease within a few weeks (87.23% of pheromone components released in July), while SBW dispensers have insufficient release rates (pheromone components in the dispensers only decreasing from 2 mg to 1.57 mg after 90 days). These results suggest the need for more careful studies on performance of the range of available commercial pheromone lures under Egyptian environments.

TI  - The simultaneous triangular relationship between certain weather factors temperature, humidity, number of captured pink bollworm male moths and infestation in green bolls
AB  - A field trial was carried out to study the combined effect of day maximum temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the corresponding number of captured pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) male moths as indicated by sex trap and infestation in green cotton bolls in the field in Assiut and Gharbia Governorates (Egypt) during the 2000 growing season. The number of captured male moths was recorded every three days during the season. The number of moths increased gradually, forming a peak when the day maximum temperature ranged between 36C on 5 May in Assiut and 33C on 20 May in Gharbia. The correlation value yielded a significant and positive "r" value between day maximum temperature and number of trapped moths and insignificant positive correlation among minimum temperature, minimum RH and number of captured moths during the valuable occurrence of green bolls susceptible to infestation (three weeks old). An insignificant positive correlation was recorded between temperature degrees and activity of newly hatched larvae, which attack the green bolls in cotton fields. The average temperature fluctuated between 29 and 30C in Gharbia and Assiut, respectively. The study also revealed that there was a relationship between average RH and the corresponding average number of newly hatched larvae of pink bollworm inside the green bolls and insignificant positive correlation for Assiut (between 39 and 46% RH). A significant positive correlation for Gharbia (between 66 and 73% RH) was found suitable for flight activity of newly hatched larvae.

TI  - Outbreak of migratory Noctuid species in vineyards and orchards in southeast Slovenia. / Pojav migratornih vrst sovk v jugovzhodni Sloveniji in Njihov kodljiv vpliv v trajnih nasadih
AB  - In permanent plantations of southeast Slovenia in the last few years, there was a mass appearance of Noctuid caterpillars on grapevine and fruit trees at the time of budding. Because of the night activity of these caterpillars, the growers could not find any of the pests. We identified the caterpillars as two related Noctua species N. fimbriata and N. comes. These two species are not known as pests in orchards and vineyards. The increase in the population density of these pests was associated with the increase in average year temperatures, especially in summer and autumn. Despite insecticide treatments, damage by these pests persisted.

TI  - Flight of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn.) as followed by light- and pheromone traps in Vrda and Balatonmagyard 2002
AB  - Prognostic surveys were carried out using Jeremy's light- and Arco-Pheron MZ type pheromone traps in a 100-ha one-piece hybrid maize field in Balatonmagyard (Zala county) and a farmer's 50-ha maize field in Vrda (Somogy county), in Hungary, during 2002. The generation number of the population appearing on the respective areas and the characteristics of the flight of the European maize borer (O. nubilalis) were determined. The meteorological data of the areas obtained from Keszthely and Kaposvr for the period concerned were compared with the data of flight. In Balatonmagyard and Vrda, 2 definite generations were found. Between the 2 generations, differences in the course of flight were observed due to different weather conditions of the 2 places. In Balatonmagyard the first, while in vrda the second generation was larger in individual number. In Balatonmagyard, male dominance was recorded for the whole year, which means that the increased number of individuals was not coupled with higher fecundity. In Vrda, the initial male dominance ceased, and the females were in excess all over the year. The meteorological elements (temperature, precipitation and relative humidity) significantly influenced the possibility of trapping in the case of both sexes. The female sex ratio had close correlations with the minimum, maximum and average temperature and precipitation data. Considerable asynchrony was observed between the data obtained with the 2 prognostic means which was ascribed to the unreliability of the pheromone trap.

TI  - Phenology of the codling moth Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in the southern part of Syria and its damage to apple fruit
AB  - The phenology of the codling moth, C. pomonella, was studied in the southern part of Syria for two consecutive years (1992-93). Adults were sampled using pheromone traps and mature larvae were sampled using cardboard traps. Sampling started in the middle of April and continued through October. Diapause of larvae from different broods and percentage infestation of apple fruit by codling moth larvae were also investigated. The codling moth achieved two successive generations a year during the study period. The adult moths had shown two peaks of abundance, the first one from late May to early June (spring generation) and another about the middle of August (summer generation). The larvae had shown a similar trend indicating two generations per year. Spring generation larvae started to appear in the first half of July and peaked early in August while summer generation larvae peaked at the end of September. A considerable proportion of spring generation larvae entered diapause and this proportion increased later in the season to reach 100% for summer generation larvae, particularly for those maturing in September and October. Indices of infested fruit have shown two peaks of infestation; the first about the middle of June, the other in the second half of August and percentage infestation at harvest exceeded 96% in neglected orchards. The obtained information can form a basis for planning control measures against this pest in the southern part of Syria.

TI  - Mating disruption against apple and pear tree codling moth advantages and limitations. A survey of 274 plots in the Provence region of southern France. / Confusion sexuelle contre le Carpocapse des pommes et des poires succs et limites de la mthode. Enqute sur 274 parcelles en Provence
AB  - The use of mating disruption as a technique for the control of apple and pear tree codling moth [Cydia pomonella] was the object of a monitoring study in Provence (co-ordinated by the CETA in Cavaillon) during 2001 and 2002. 130 hectares of land were monitored in 2001 and a further 202 in 2002, a grand total of 274 plots, with weekly feedback reports of moth attacks occurring and crop damage caused. The method provided satisfactory protection in terms of damage to yield and also helped to reduce significantly the number of chemical insecticide applications an average of 1.8 application per plots where mating disruption was used in 2002, with weather conditions favourable to the development of codling moth, in a sector which was previously subjected to between 8 and 12 applications per year. A statistical plot-by-plot analysis of the efficacy of the method brings to light the key success factors of the technique and also its limitations. The shape, size and landscape of the plots concerned must be taken into account and also the surrounding environment and the stage of maturity of the varieties. First results of 2003 confirm this facts. If these conditions are taken into account, it should be possible to make the method even more effective and therefore to reduce the average number of insecticide applications and to increase the number of product-free plots.

TI  - Traditional regulation of edible caterpillar exploitation in the Kopa area of Mpika District in northern Zambia
AB  - The Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of the Bisa people of northern Zambia on species, life cycles and host plants of the caterpillars they exploit for food and for household income generation, and the traditional control of caterpillar harvesting, were investigated through a household survey. The accessed indigenous knowledge on caterpillar biology was validated through a forest survey, caterpillar collections and identifications. Eight species of caterpillars were harvested from the surrounding miombo woodlands. Their life systems and host plants were well understood by members of local communities and this knowledge was communicated amongst them orally. Popular commercial species were Gynanisa maja and Gonimbrasia zambesina. Over 20 miombo tree species hosted the two species but the mean numbers of the caterpillars on Julbernardia paniculata were significantly larger than those on other host plants (p&lt;0.05), indicating that J. paniculata was probably the main host plant of the two species. Traditional regulation of caterpillar harvesting involved (i) monitoring for edible caterpillar development and abundance and for changes in caterpillar habitats, (ii) protection of host plants and moth eggs against late bush fires, through use of traditional fire technology, and (iii) temporal restriction of edible caterpillar harvesting. The possibility of the Zambian Government promoting caterpillar harvesting as an economic incentive to the Bisa people to conserve both this renewable edible caterpillar natural resource and their environment is discussed.

TI  - Microflora of soils under pine forests area affected by gradation of leaf-eating insects
AB  - Soils of pine [Pinus] forests in the Bytnica Forestry District, Poland, are poor in nutrients readily accessible to plants. The excessively acidic reaction of the soils, typical for soils under pine forests, unfavourably affects the growth of microorganisms whose numbers are lower than in soils under deciduous and mixed forests. In the pine forests of the studied forestry, there were outbreaks of a defoliating insect - pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea), which resulted in over 60% defoliation of the trees. The studies were carried out on the area of tree stands subjected to gradation by leaf-eating insects (sprayed and not sprayed) and healthy stand of the same age class (age 60 to 70 years). The studies revealed increased number of soil microorganisms in samples taken from the area affected by pine beauty moth gradation in the case of both unsprayed areas and those sprayed with the pesticide. The occurrence in these soils of larger numbers of ammonifying and denitrifying bacteria points to the presence of conditions favouring the growth of heterotrophic organisms. Changes in the number of actinomycetes and fungi in soils under tree stands subjected to gradation by insects, compared to healthy stands, can be a consequence of a change of environmental conditions (e.g., % content of organic carbon). Soils under defoliated tree stands show higher biochemical activity related to nitrogen cycling in the pine forest ecosystem. This leads to higher availability of organic nitrogen for conversion to inorganic forms of nitrogen, which are utilized by trees. Further changes occurring in soils under forest stands affected by gradation by leaf-eating insects would allow to gain knowledge on the ecological consequences of the use of insecticides in the protection of pine stands against harmful insects, with particular stress on those situations in which pine stands not threatened by complete defoliation are sprayed.

TI  - Recent data on the microlepidopterans of Saxony, with notes on other German federal states (Lepidoptera) IV. / Aktuelle Daten zur Kleinschmetterlingsfauna von Sachsen mit Hinweisen zu anderen Bundeslndern (Lep.) IV
AB  - This paper presents recent collections of microlepidopterans from Saxony containing 21 species that are reported from Saxony for the first time, and 16 species that are reported for the first time since 1980. Phyllonorycter issikii is observed for the first time from Germany in 2001. Two published records of Agnathosia mendicella and Aplota kadeniella, which are overlooked and not included in the German fauna, are mentioned. Seven species are reported for the first time, and one for the first time since 1980, from the state of Bradenburg. Caloptilia fidelia is already observed in Lower Saxony before 1900, but is overlooked by Gaedike & Heinicke (See Gaedike, R. & Heinicke, W. Verzeichnis der Schmetterlinge Deutschlands. Entomofauna Germanica 3. Entomologische Nachrichten und Berichte (1999) Beiheft 5, 1-216). Pammene germana is reported for the first time since 1980 from Saxony and Bradenburg, while Eurhodope rosella is reported for the first time since 1980 from Germany. Oxyptilius distans is reported from Thuringia for the first time since 1980. Eudonia delunella is not observed in large parts of Central Europe. Specimens in museums document the first occurrence of these species in Hessem, Rhineland-Palatinate and Badenburg. Specimens supporting historical records from Saxony and Bavaria are not available and these records are regarded as erroneous.

TI  - Studies on diapause in sugarcane plassey borer, Chilo tumidicostalis Hmpsn
AB  - Studies on diapause in Chilo tumidicostalis larvae were conducted by periodically collecting 6th instar larvae from sugarcane field at Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, Assam, India from 1999 to 2000. Larvae living longer than 20 days in the laboratory before pupation were considered to undergo diapause. The insect underwent facultative diapause in full-grown larval stage. Diapaused larvae were most abundant in field during November and December as evidenced by collection of mostly matured larval stage and the absence of the pupae in the field. The average time required for pupation of field-collected larvae in the laboratory during October, November and December 1999 ranged from 28.0 to 42.8 days, while the duration was 8.3 to 19.6 days for field-collected larvae during May to September 1999. Diapaused larvae increased steadily from 3.3% in July to 95.2% in December 1999 and then decreased to 46.2% in January 2000 and by March 2000 to 4.7%. The percentage diapause incidence showed significant negative correlation with photoperiod (r=-0.750) and mean temperature (r=-0.633). The short photoperiod, low mean temperature and accumulation of sucrose in the canes/ripening of cane may influence the rate of larval diapause in this insect and the interaction of these needs to be analysed further.

TI  - Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) in urban habitats the moths of Warsaw. I. Noctuidae, Pantheidae, Nolidae
AB  - Some 302 moth species of the families Noctuidae, Pantheidae and Nolidae have been recorded in Warsaw, Poland to date. Of these, 286 species were recorded in historical times (86 of them only then, including one which can no longer be found in Poland, Mesogona acetosellae). Most of these species are now regarded as very rare and occurring only locally in Central Europe (e.g. Idia calvaria, Schrankia taenialis, Catocala pacta, Polychrysia moneta, Plusidia cheiranthi, Heliothis ononis, Acosmetia caliginosa, Dicycla oo and Trichosea ludifica). Contemporary records list 212 species, most of which are widely distributed in Poland and classified as abundant (e.g. Discestra trifolii, Mythimna pallens, Xestia c-nigrum and Agrotis exclamationis). Seven species, Macdunnoughia confusa, Autographa gamma, Schinia scutosa, Heliothis peltigera, Spodoptera exigua, Luperina zollikoferi and Agrotis ipsilon, are migrant visitors.

TI  - Courtship and mating behaviour of the Mediterranean corn borer, Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - The behavioural sequence of courtship and mating of S. nonagrioides males and females in laboratory cages is described. The attractant capacity of both sexes was studied by tethering males or females. The courtship and mating sequence of tethered females was the same as untethered ones, but tethered males were absolutely inactive. Age (1 day versus 2 days) did not affect the mating rate. Differences in calling time onset and first calling age were found between north-eastern Spanish and Greek populations. The role of hair pencils in courtship flight is discussed, rejecting that they stimulate calling behaviour of females or that they attract females. The influence of adult population density was studied in laboratory and field tests, and was found to have no effect on the mating rate in the controls. However, moth density influenced mating rates where mating disruption treatments were applied. Several consequences for investigations into pheromone composition and its use in monitoring and population control are reported in the discussion.

TI  - Seasonal incidence of pigeonpea pod borers under Akola conditions (Maharashtra)
AB  - A field experiment was conducted in the kharif season of 2000 in Akola, Maharashtra, India to investigate the seasonal occurrence of pod borers (Helicoverpa armigera and Exelastis atomosa) on pigeon pea cv. Maruti. Weekly observations were done to evaluate the numbers of H. armigera egg and pupae, and E. atomosa larvae and pupae. The pest population was generally low in 2002. Data revealed that the oviposition of H. armigera started from the 41st meteorological week (1 egg/5 plants) when the maximum and minimum temperature, morning and evening relative humidity and rainfall were 32.3 and 16.2C, 72 and 47%, and 0 mm, respectively. Oviposition decreased until the 46th meteorological week, and no eggs were observed from the 48th week onwards. H. armigera larvae were active from the 41st to the 49th meteorological week, with a peak in activity in the 47th week (1.2 larvae/5 plants) when the maximum and minimum temperature, morning and evening relative humidity, and rainfall were 31.3 and 11.3C, 72 and 41%, and 0 mm, respectively. E. atomosa larvae were also active from the 41st to 49th meteorological weeks, with a peak in activity in the 45th week (2 larvae/5 plants) when the minimum and maximum temperature, morning and evening relative humidity and rainfall were 32.3 and 16.2C, 72 and 47%, and 0 mm, respectively.

TI  - Factors affecting the field performance of an attracticide against the codling moth Cydia pomonella
AB  - Factors affecting the efficacy of an attracticide strategy for the control of the codling moth C. pomonella were investigated using laboratory and field experiments in a number of sites in Europe and in Germany. The sex-pheromone-based insect control strategy utilizes 100-l droplets of a sticky, paste-like formulation containing 1 mg/g (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol (codlemone) as an attractant for male moths and 40 mg/g cyfluthrin, a contact insecticide, applied to branches in the upper parts of the tree crown. The longevity of the treatment under field conditions was assessed in the laboratory by biological testing of variously aged samples of the attracticide formulation which had been applied to the bark of apple cv. James Grieve trees growing in commercial orchards. Electroantennogram responses of male moth antennae were used to compare codlemone release from the attracticide after different lengths of environmental exposure. Changes in insecticidal efficacy of the same samples were assessed with reference to the speed of knockdown (KT50) and the mortalities after 48 h among populations of male moths confined in cages containing samples of fresh and field-aged formulations. Gradual declines in both the amount of pheromone released and insecticidal activity were observed over the 10-week period of the experiments. Various factors associated with the behaviour of codling moths in the field which might influence the attracticide strategy were also investigated. Although the vertical position of attracticide sources within apple trees had a strong influence on their attractiveness, their horizontal position had none. Results of field trials showed that efficacy of the attracticide depends on the population density of the pest. Under the conditions of the current study a density of three or more sources per tree (=4500 sources per ha) was required to attain satisfactory levels of codling moth control.

TI  - Frequency distribution of Malacosoma neustria (L.) egg masses and nests in cork oak forests
AB  - In order to define a reliable sampling method for the defoliating moth, data on population density of M. neustria were collected. Wild M. neustria populations were monitored at seven field localities in the major cork oak (Quercus suber) forests of Sardinia (Italy), in the spring of 1998 and 1999. Egg mass and nest location on trees was analysed. An insect preference in laying the egg masses on the East and South facing side of the tree canopy was recorded. Nest distribution on the trees followed the same trend. The spatial distribution among trees was analysed taking into account the fitting of Poisson's, Neyman's and negative binomial mathematical models to the actual distributions. In all localities nests had a gathered distribution among trees while the egg mass location showed a different pattern. Taylor's power law regression was used to determine sample size requirements necessary for estimating population average with two fixed levels of precision (D=0.10; D=0.25). At low egg mass density condition a high number of trees should be observed (D=0.10; x=0.51; n=370223). Using Taylor's power law parameters at a precision level D=0.25 with a population density of 1 egg mass per tree, it is necessary to examine 36 trees. The results obtained encourage us to suppose that the observation of a limited part of the tree offers reliable data to estimate the pest population density.

TI  - Temperature and food quality effects on growth, consumption and post-ingestive utilization efficiencies of the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria (Lepidoptera Lasiocampidae)
AB  - Temperature and food quality can both influence growth rates, consumption rates, utilization efficiencies and developmental time of herbivorous insects. Gravimetric analyses were conducted during two consecutive years to assess the effects of temperature and food quality on fourth instar larvae of the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria Hbner. Larvae were reared in the laboratory at three different temperatures (18, 24 and 30C) and on two types of diet; leaves of sugar maple trees Acer saccharum Marsh. located at the forest edge (sun-exposed leaves) or within the forest interior (shade-exposed leaves). In general, larvae reared at 18C had lower growth rates and lower consumption rates than larvae reared at the warmer temperatures (24 and 30C). Moreover, the duration of the instar decreased significantly with increasing temperatures. Type of diet also affected the growth rates and amount of food ingested by larvae but did not affect the duration of the instar. Larvae fed sun-exposed leaves consumed more food and gained higher biomasses. Values of approximate digestibility and efficiency of conversion of ingested food were also higher when larvae were fed sun-exposed leaves. Higher growth rates with increasing temperatures were primarily the result of the shorter stadium duration. The higher growth rates of larvae fed sun-exposed leaves were possibly the result of stimulatory feeding and consequently greater food intake and also a more efficient use of food ingested. This study suggests that the performance of M. disstria caterpillars could be enhanced by warmer temperatures and higher leaf quality.

TI  - Inter- and intra-site variation in the fruiting of common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in England over a twenty two year period (1980-2001)
AB  - This study of annual production of mast by the common beech (Fagus sylvatica) in England has now continued for twenty two years; it will be further extended in order to assess long term regional and temporal variation of masting in this species. During this period, beech mast has been sampled from approximately 100 trees by 7-minute samples collected from the ground. Aerial samples have also been collected from low-growing branches. The sites concerned varied from closed canopy beechwood to shelter belts, avenues and isolated trees in parks. Production of full seed varies greatly from year to year. Regional variation is much less, but over the period the northern trees have produced on average fewer full nuts but rather more empty and total nuts. Good masting occurred in 1980, 1982, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1995, 1997 and 2000 in these years at least one year of very poor masting normally followed. No full mast was found in 1981 and singularly little in 1991 and 2001. All trees produce empty pericarps as well as full mast, especially on lower or shaded branches. The proportion of full nuts consumed or damaged by the moth Cydia fagiglandana, birds and small mammals, in English sites, can become significant in non-mast years.

TI  - The possibilities of using pheromone traps and total thermal summation in estimating adult emergence of Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.), a pest of cotton growing areas in Amik Plain
AB  - P. gossypiella adult emergence and population dynamics were evaluated in Hatay, Turkey during 1996, 1997, and 1998 using pheromone traps and thermal summation. Adult emergence in the overwintering generation, which occurred for 2.0-2.5 months, commenced at the end of April or at the beginning of May and continued up to the first week of July; peak adult emergence was observed during the first week of June. Adult population was highest throughout the middle of June; it declined at the beginning of July (initiation of cotton flowering), but increased during flowering and boll formation stage. The initial adult emergence in 1996, 1997, and 1998 required 136.43, 137.43, and 186.95 heat sums, respectively; corresponding values for peak adult emergence were 570.80, 460.23, and 479.35 heat sums. During the same years, the overwintering generation required 980.80, 1090.57, and 1157.50 heat sums. The relationship between the number of adults in the field and number of adults trapped was significant in 1997. It was concluded that sex pheromone traps can be used to monitor P. gossypiella populations and that effective total thermal summation can be employed along with sex pheromone traps in evaluating first adult emergence.

AB  - Probably because of the warmer climate observed during the last decade, the army worm P. unipuncta (Mythimna unipuncta) has been able to colonize the Magadino plain in Tessin, Switzerland. Overwintering larvae were found in the vineyards of Gudo. The first moths from chrysalises of the previous year were caught in light traps from the end of February to the middle of March. Due to favourable seasonal weather conditions, the population increased considerably in 1997, provoking in autumn important damage in grasslands and in the cultures of seed maize during the following year. The evolution of the pest is monitored by light traps.

TI  - Population dynamics, damage pattern and management of spotted pod borer (Maruca testulalis Geyer.) in early pigeonpea under North Bihar conditions
AB  - Experiments were conducted in Bihar, India during 1990-91 and 1991-92 to determine the population trend and damage potential of the spotted pod borer Maruca testulalis [Maruca vitrata] on early pigeon pea. The management of spotted pod borer was also determined. The larval population of spotted pod borer fluctuated widely in relation to seasonal changes beginning from the second week of October until the end of December. The period of maximum activity was between the second and last week of November, when the mean population fluctuated around 12.67-15.17 larvae/plant. Flower damage was minimum (0.65%) in the second week of October and increased to maximum level (18.66%) in the last week of November. The mean level of pod damage gradually increased from 10.46 to 26.50% from the third week of October to the last week of December. Fenvalerate (0.01%) was the best treatment and gave maximum reduction in pod damage (73.7%) and increase in grain yield (78.3%) compared to the control. Neem oil (2.0%) also reduced pod damage by 30.4%.

TI  - Observations on the spatial distribution of green oak leaf-roller moth eggs in Sardinian forests. Third contribution sampling design in Quercus pubescens Willd. forest stands. / Indagini sulla distribuzione spaziale delle ovide-posizioni di Tortrix viridana L. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in querceti della Sardegna. Terzo contributo disegno di campionamento in formazioni forestali a Quercus pubescens Willd
AB  - In order to design a method for monitoring the abundance of Tortrix viridana eggs in large forest areas, the spatial distribution of the egg-clusters was investigated in eight Q. pubescens stands in central Sardinia, Italy. In each area of between 300 and 1000 ha, a three-stage sampling was conducted 8 one-hectare plots per area, 8 trees per plot, 4 terminal branches per tree. The egg-clusters on the branches were counted in the laboratory. During the survey, the average time taken by a team of two samplers was reckoned (6.5, 1.5 and 4.5 minutes respectively to identify a plot within the area, a tree within the plot, and the collecting and checking of a branch). Using Kuno's method for multistage sampling, we determined, for each area, the optimal allocation of sampling effort for extensive surveys, with precision D=25 and 20%, and for intensive surveys with D=10%. The total effort calculated varied for the three levels of precision (25, 20 and 10%) from 14 to 78, from 21 to 120 and from 84 to 468 branches, between the most heavily infested area and that with the lowest egg-cluster density (8 and 2 egg-clusters per branch, respectively). The univocal sampling design was determined by studying the relationship between the number of branches to be sampled per area (E) and the mean number of egg-clusters per branch (x) with the function E=a.bl/x. The three equations obtained significantly interpolated the sampling data (r2=0.91, 0.90 and 0.88 for D=25, 20 and 10%) and allowed the calculation of the optimal sampling effort as 34, 50 and 195 branches per area respectively, considering the density of 4 egg-clusters per branch as potentially dangerous for the forest. Finally, a fixed sampling plan for within plots was drawn up, involving the collection of 8 branches, 2 per tree from 4 randomly selected trees. The number of plots to be sampled in each forest area was left variable, depending on the level of precision, and proved to be 5, 7 and 25 respectively for D=25, 20 and 10%. This study helped us design a sampling method for T. viridana eggs, to obtain precise estimates of egg-cluster abundance in large areas of forest. This could be useful for making reliable projections about the risk of infestation in forests of deciduous oaks.

TI  - Shifting cultivation, edible caterpillars and livelihoods in the Kopa area of Northern Zambia
AB  - A survey on customary land and an adjacent forest reserve was conducted in the Kopa area of northern Zambia in November 2000. The objectives of the survey were to describe habitats of edible caterpillars and assess temporal and spatial variations in caterpillar abundance, the impact of tree cutting during caterpillar harvesting and the potential of edible caterpillars as sources of income for rural households. The results showed that edible caterpillars have the potential, even in years of moderate abundance, to generate incomes of over US$60 per household that are comparable to, or even higher than, incomes from the sale of agricultural crops. The most favourable habitats for the production of the two most popular edible caterpillars, Gynanisa maja and Gonimbrasia zambesina, were in young re-growth Brachystegia-Julbernardia (miombo) woodland regenerating after abandonment of chitemene shifting cultivation, probably because of the increase in abundance of their main host tree, Julbernardia paniculata; this species made up 55% of the trees in re-growth compared to 18% in the uneven-aged old-growth miombo woodland in the forest reserve adjacent to the customary land used for chitemene shifting cultivation. Although more trees were cut in young re-growths during caterpillar harvesting, tree mortality was negligible and recovery was better than in old-growth miombo woodland that is dominated by big trees that do not coppice readily. Selective cutting in old-growth woodland during caterpillar harvesting resulted in higher mortality of J. paniculata and regeneration from saplings was suppressed by the shade from uncut trees. The high mortality and poor regeneration reduce the capacity of old-growth miombo woodland to support edible caterpillars. The results also indicate that clear felling, as is practised during chitemene shifting cultivation, raises the capacity of the woodland to support edible caterpillars. We recommend that a trial caterpillar production working circle be created in Lwitikila forest reserve and managed by the local community primarily for the sustained production and harvesting of edible caterpillars in order to increase household and/or community benefits from the forest. If successful, the practice could be extended within the Kopa area of northern Zambia and to other similar sites.

TI  - Tropical grass webworm (Herpetogramma licarsisalis) implications for dairy farming in Northland
AB  - The presence of larvae of Herpetogramma licarsisalis (tropical grass webworm (TGW)) in pasture on the Aupouri Peninsula in Northland, New Zealand, was confirmed in March 1999. A delineation survey undertaken in late March 1999 found an infested area of approximately 37 000 ha, of which 4450 ha was in dairying. The establishment of TGW in the area has been confirmed by ongoing monitoring of populations from 1999 to the present. Populations decline to extremely low numbers over the winter months with the main pasture damage period in early autumn (March/April). Infestations to date have been mainly confined to kikuyu pastures. In 1999 and 2002 visual estimations were made of pasture damage by TGW. The implications of this damage are discussed within the context of management practices and economic constraints for dairy farming in the area.

TI  - Effects of temperature on egg laying activity of codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.)
AB  - Experiments were carried out in apple (cv. Lobo) orchards at the Lithuanian Institute of Horticulture, Lithuania in 1998-2001 to investigate the egg-laying activity of codling moth in relation to temperature. At the end of flowering, pheromone traps were placed in the orchard to monitor the population dynamics of codling moth. A high correlation between mean temperature at sunset (21.00-23.00 h) and egg-laying activity was observed. The highest correlation was found in 1998 and 1999. Codling moth started to lay eggs when the temperature was at least 15.6, 16.4, 16.2 and 16.1C in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The number of adults, eggs and larvae increased if the temperature was higher. On average, codling moth started to lay eggs at 16.1C.

TI  - Influence of weather factors on the population of rice leaf folder in the coastal region of Karaikal
AB  - Weekly light trap moth catches were monitored in Karaikal, Tamil Nadu, India from June 1992 to May 1996 to study the variation of rice leaf folder moths (RLF; Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and Marasmia patnalis) in light traps during different periods. The effects of weather factors on moth are discussed. RLF population was lowest from June to July and highest during August and September. The population declined and increased in October, where it reached its second peak in November. The adult catches in different months significantly varied in the respective years. The catch was significantly highest in August-October 1993. A unit increase in the minimum temperature caused an increase in the population of RLF adults by 0.10 until it reached the mean minimum temperature (24.2C). There was a negative correlation between RLF population and relative humidity. The observed mean minimum temperature was optimum for moth emergence. This situation prevailed from August to December, which resulted in an increase in the number of RLF adults in the light trap. The mean maximum temperature (32.1C) mostly prevailed between the months of March and July, and was non-conducive for RLF multiplication. Only a small number of moths were caught in the light trap with a decrease in temperature to 24.2C between January and February.

TI  - The horse chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) - biology, spread, and control. / Die Rosskastanien-Miniermotte (Cameraria ohridella) - Biologie, Verbreitung und Gegenmassnahmen
AB  - C. ohridella is widespread in Germany. Anthropogenic transport of adults and pupae by land, water, and aerial plankton has contributed to its distribution. The development of the pest population passes through several generations per year. The pupae may lie dormant for several years. Until now, medium damage (reduced leaf size, emergency flowering in the autumn, reduced formation of fruits, and year rings) has been observed. Infestation may be reduced by sticky trap rings around the trunks, but not with sticky sheets. Mass trapping using pheromone traps is not suitable for direct control. Pheromone traps, however, are suitable for monitoring purposes, particularly at certain phenological stages. Natural enemies (polyphagous species) show rates of parasitism between 5 and 20% (maximum). This is not sufficient for effective pest control. Progress could be made by detecting the natural habitat of C. ohridella to select the suitable antagonists. Red flowering horse chest nut [Aesculus hippocastanum] trees are usually less infested than white flowering ones. For chemical control, only systemic insecticides are suitable. Soil injection procedures and trunk injections may be used. Until now, an insecticide for this particular purpose has not been registered in Germany. A strategy for the sustainable protection of horse chestnut should fulfill the principles of integrated plant protection. This strategy conforms to the cost effectiveness and specific legal regulations. There is a need for future research on the biology and population dynamics of C. ohridella, physiological reactions of host plants, relationship between infestation and damage, and the selection and breeding of trees which are less susceptible to this pest.

TI  - Effect of the 3rd generation differentiation ratio and drought on the temporal dynamics of the mason pine caterpillar, Dendrolimus punctatus Walker (Lepidoptera Lasiocampidae)
AB  - The effect of the 3rd generation differentiation ratio and drought on the temporal dynamics of the masson pine caterpillar, D. punctatus, is revealed by correlation analysis of 27 years' data on the abundance of this species. The 3rd generation differentiation ratios of masson pine caterpillars fluctuate periodically and usually can be divided into three levels 1-10, 11-40 and 41-100%. The peaks occur about every 5 to 6 years with low differentiation ratios before and after the peaks. Moderate and low differentiation ratios alternate between peaks. Correlation analysis indicates that the 3rd generation differentiation ratio has a distinct relationship only with the occurrence rate of the present generation and not following generations. There is no correlation between 3rd generation differentiation ratios and the occurrence rates of previous generations. The key climatic factor affecting differentiation ratios is the temperature in July. Under higher temperatures more larvae hatch before the critical photoperiod that causes high differentiation ratios. Though drought affects the differentiation ratio slightly, it has a delayed, but distinct, effect on occurrence rate. The most affected generation is the first generation of the following year. The results reveal that drought not only affects the dynamics of current generations of masson pine caterpillars but also, more importantly, affects the pines, which in turn affects the next generation of masson pine caterpillars.

TI  - Some peculiarities of the long-term dynamics of the day's absolute maximum and minimum temperatures and the emergence rate of adult apple ermine moths (Yponomeuta malinellus Zell.) in Lithuania
AB  - A study was carried out to analyse the dynamics of the day's absolute maximum and minimum temperatures in Vilnius, Lithuania, in different years of the 20th century and its effect on the emergence rate of adult apple ermine moths (Y. malinellus) in the last three decades. During the 20th century, the range of the absolute minimum and maximum temperatures of the day varied from -35 to +35C. A large number of absolute maximum temperatures (up to 56%) and minimum temperatures (58%) were registered in the second half of the 20th century. The intervals of temperature fluctuations were also higher at the end of the 20th century. The changes in the course of emergence of adult apple ermine moths and the trends of the long-term dynamics of the day's temperatures were thoroughly investigated during 28 vegetative seasons of 1973-2000. The period of the emergence of adult apple ermine moths lasted from 15 to 35 days. The time of emergence varied from 0 to 25 days. The emergence of adult apple ermine moths occurred from the end of the first ten-day period of June till the middle of the first ten-day period of August. Earlier emergence of adult apple ermine moths was recorded in 1984. Since 1998, the emergence of adult individuals has occurred even earlier.

TI  - Hornet clearwing moth (Sesia apiformis [Clerck]) and dieback of poplars in Eastern England
AB  - Poplar trees showing severe dieback, or defoliation and death within a growing season, have been reported during recent years from the region around Bedford, Milton Keynes and Northampton in eastern England. Many of the affected trees have also been found to be attacked by the hornet clearwing moth, Sesia apiformis. Larvae of this moth tunnel beneath the bark of the lower trunk and roots, and it has been suggested that the moth might be the cause of the decline in tree health. However, a survey of 801 poplar trees in 1999 confirmed that, although there was a correlation between the amount of dieback and the number of moth exit holes visible in the trunk (r2=0.38), there was considerable variation in the relationship and a significant number of trees showed severe dieback but no evidence of infestation. The data demonstrate that dieback in many trees cannot be attributed to S. apiformis and that the moth most likely acts as a secondary agent in tree decline. Up to 53% of trees with severe dieback occurred in shelterbelts, and many of these sites were situated on reclaimed land or other man-made substrates. The area where dieback has been most prevalent is one of the hottest and driest parts of the UK, and the reports of dieback in poplar and the apparent increase in S. apiformis activity follow particular dry springs and early summers in 1995 and 1996. The available evidence suggests, therefore, that the deterioration in the health of poplars in this region is not caused directly by S. apiformis, but by a combination of climate and perhaps human influences.

TI  - Studies on seasonal incidence of head borer Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) on sunflower crop during Rabi season
AB  - A study was initiated during the rabi season of 1996 in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, to investigate the influence of current and one week lag weather factors (maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, relative humidity and sunshine hours) on the head borer (H. armigera) incidence on sunflower crops. Five sowings were undertaken, starting from November 1996 to March 1997. In the November-sown crop, the population increased gradually, reaching its peak of 1.7 larvae/plant in the 1st week of January and then declined. In the December-sown crop, the population reached its peak of 1.9 larvae/plant in the 3rd week of January and then subsequently declined. In the January-sown crop, a maximum of 1.8 larvae/plant was recorded in the 1st week of March and then disappeared towards the end of the crop growth period. In the February-sown crop, the population peaked (1.4 larvae/plant) during the 4th week of March and disappeared after the 1st week of April. The lag maximum temperature and lag relative humidity at 1416 h negatively influenced the larval population in March- and December-sown crops, respectively. Lag weather parameters were found to affect larval population more significantly than current weather parameters during all the sowings, except for the current minimum temperature, which had a significant positive effect on the larval population in the December-sown crop.

AB  - During 1996-98, studies were conducted to determine the occurrence of P. blancardella on apple trees growing in protected and unprotected orchards in Lublin, Poland. Four sites, so-called unprotected orchards, were not given any chemical treatments. Only one site, an experimental orchard of the Agricultural University, was chemically treated. Approximately 5000 mines of apple leaf blister moth were collected. This species occurred on trees growing in the suburban areas, as well as in the centre of the city, both in unprotected and protected orchards where chemical treatment was applied. Fluctuations in the numbers of P. blancardella were noted at all examined sites, which were shaped by man at various degrees.

TI  - Mechanism for saltational shifts in pheromone communication systems
AB  - A commentary on the saltational events in pheromone communication systems is presented. In particular, in an ancestral Ostriniamoth population, a saltational event occurred and gave rise to a new pheromone and new species, the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnicalis. A pseudogene that had been unexpressed for millions of years in the genome of Ostrinia and that controlled desaturation of pheromone molecules, suddenly became expressed. A case is made that the shift to the new pheromone was accomplished by ancestral males via asymmetric tracking of females emitting the new blend.

TI  - Monitoring the population dynamics of the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella with a synthetic pheromone in Europe
AB  - A monitoring system for C. ohridella (which infests almost exclusively horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanum) males based on a synthetic sex pheromone was tested in the Czech Republic, Germany, France, and Greece. From the obtained data on the insect phenology, we concluded that in Central Europe, C. ohridella typically has three generations per year. Pheromone monitoring, which can be used to detect the pest when it appears in uninfested areas, is suitable to the determination of population densities.

TI  - Prediction of grape moths dynamics using age structured models
AB  - Seven years (1993-2000) of continuous monitoring of both, the flight occurrence of male adults and the following developmental stages (e.g. eggs and larvae) of two grape moth species in the Rhine and Main river region (Germany) revealed a large variance within the data. Additionally, precise associations related to the concurrently recorded weather data could not be established. With respect to the heterogeneity of the population dynamics of the grape moths through time and density, a generalized Leslie process was adopted for the quantitative and qualitative description of their developmental stages. The flexibility of the model concept was achieved by joining nonlinear response functions that relate changes of developmental rates to changes in weather conditions with probability distribution functions. The required survival probabilities were estimated using results obtained from related climatic chamber experiments and from intensive monitoring in the vineyard. Further parameter values of the model equations were identified by a step-by-step procedure, which included adding model complexity in time and weather covariates and simultaneous fitting to the observations. Within the capacity of the model, it was possible to find constant transformation factors for data measured on different scales. The model represents a combination of both the understanding of biological mechanisms within a season and empirical components reconciling gaps of information. Potential and limits of the model are demonstrated in this report.

TI  - Feasibility of light-trapping in community research on moths attraction radius of light, completeness of samples, nightly flight times and seasonality of Southeast-Asian hawkmoths (Lepidoptera Sphingidae)
AB  - Experimental data and quantitative samples of Sphingid assemblages from tropical Southeast-Asia were analyzed to investigate methodologically relevant topics of light-trapping. Mark-Release-Recapture experiments revealed differences between lepidopteran families in the attraction radius of a light source, but no such differences could be found between 18 species within the family Sphingidae. Attraction radii (for 50% return rate within 5 minutes) were generally below 30 meters, which confirms results from previously published studies. Arrival of Sphingidae individuals at a light source was symmetrically distributed around midnight, and species differed significantly in median arrival time. No evolutionary hypothesis for such flight time differences (such as avoidance of interspecific mating or an effect of body size) could be confirmed from our data. At appropriately chosen sample sites (avoiding dense undergrowth), all-night sampling with a 125 Watt mercury-vapor lamp yielded more than 3/4 of the expected species richness of Sphingidae in an average of 5-6 sample nights. Seasonally and temporal changes of local assemblages can probably be neglected for samples from largely non-seasonal regions like Borneo if data stem from a relatively short study time of a few years. In conclusion, (1) there are no indications that light trapping 'draws' specimens from distant habitats to the sampling site, (2) we did not find proof that species within the family Sphingidae are differentially drawn to light, which would lead to biases if light-trapping data are used as a measure of relative abundance in the habitat, (3) such biases, on the other hand, probably exist between taxonomically or morphologically more diverse taxa (e.g. for different families), and must be considered for a proper interpretation of results, and (4) light-trapping is an effective means of assessing species composition and relative abundances of Sphingid assemblages in Southeast-Asia, but sampling has to be carried out all night in order to maximize catch size and avoid biases due to different flight times of species.

TI  - Mating disruption of Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in vineyards with very high population densities
AB  - Two tortricids, L. botrana and Eupoecilia ambiguella, are the most important insect pests in German viticulture. Both species are bivoltine and the second generation is the most damaging to grapes. In many German viticultural regions, populations of L. botrana have been increasing over the past years, while Eupoecilia ambiguella populations have been decreasing. Today, both species can be controlled by mating disruption. Although the mating disruption technique can be used to effectively control L. botrana at low population densities, the technique is not as effective at high population densities. An evaluation of the potential for using a combination of insecticide and mating disruption to control L. botrana at high densities was started in Neustadt/Weinstrasse during 1999. The objective of the two-year project was to reduce L. botrana populations within the trial site to a level where mating disruption could be exclusively used for control. The results obtained in 1999 demonstrated that moth captures in pheromone-baited traps as well as larval densities were significantly reduced, compared to previous years. However, density was not reduced to a level where mating disruption could be used alone for control of the first generation of 2000. Therefore in 2000, a combined treatment of pheromone plus insecticides has to be repeated, in an attempt to reduce population densities to a lower level where mating disruption will perform effectively.

TI  - Improving the prediction of adult codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) emergence in a natural environment
AB  - The precise prediction of moth flight is a key-factor for an efficient monitoring and a successful and sustainable control of codling moth C. pomonella. Nevertheless, forecasting is generally complicated by the large variability of the individual post-diapause developmental times. The spatial distribution of the hibernation sites and the corresponding microclimate were investigated from February 1996 to December 1999 to improve the understanding of the scattered emergence pattern of adult moths in spring. C. pomonella had no preference for a particular apple (cv. James Grieve) trunk sector for hibernation. Diapausing larvae were equally distributed around the tree trunk, independent of the time of diapause entrance. However, temperature varied considerably between southern and northern trunk sectors, particularly in winter and early spring when tree trunks were heated by incident radiation. Based on continuous temperature recordings from four consecutive years trunk temperature was described as a function of air temperature and incident radiation. Using this relationship site specific temperature sums were approximated to predict the beginning of moth flight. The approach was validated with independent observations on the hatching of adults from southern (sun exposed) and northern (shaded) trunk sectors. It was concluded to improve the accuracy of codling moth forecasting and hence to contribute to an optimization of monitoring control measures.

TI  - Species composition and seasonal dynamics of lepidopterous stem borers on maize and elephant grass, Pennisetum purpureum (Moench) (Poaceae), at two forest margin sites in Cameroon
AB  - Lepidopterous stem borers were monitored on plots of maize, Zea mays, and elephant grass, Pennisetum purpureum (Moench), during two consecutive cropping seasons and the off-season at two forest margin locations, Nkolbisson and Minkomeyos, in Cameroon. Busseola fusca (Fuller), Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) and Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) were found on both hosts. In addition, Cryptophlebia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) and Mussidia nigrivenella Ragonot (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) were collected from maize, and Poeonoma serrata (Hampson) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) from elephant grass. Busseola fusca was the most abundant species on both host plants. The numbers of eggs per square metre on different plant hosts was not significantly different, whereas numbers of larvae and pupae were 3-9 times higher on elephant grass than on maize. Analysis of numbers of B. fusca larvae according to size/age classes indicate that all sizes tended to be more abundant on elephant grass than on maize, but significant differences were found only during the second season at Minkomeyos, when densities were high. No significant differences were found between host plants for diapausing larvae and pupae. The implications for the possible function of the grass as a trap plant or reservoir for natural enemies in the management of B. fusca are discussed.

TI  - Population density and flight activity of Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.) moths using sex-pheromone and light traps
AB  - An experiment was carried out in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, Egypt during 1998-99 from the beginning of May to the end of November to compare the fluctuations in the population density of the male cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis and the male pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella captured in sex-pheromone baited traps and light traps. Catches in sex pheromone traps were generally higher than those in the light traps for both species, although the ratio varied from month to month. The total number of captured S. littoralis male was higher than that of P. gossypiella during the whole period of investigation in both sex pheromone and light traps. The total number of male moths from both species caught in the two types of traps collected during 1999 (17428.5 moths/trap) was higher than during 1998 (15583.4 moths/trap). The flight activity of S. littoralis and P. gossypiella moths (represented as percentage of captured male moths) ranged between 71.4 and 82.1% respectively, during the first half of night. At late seasons of 1998 and 1999, the ratio between the total number of S. littoralis captured in sex pheromone and light traps was 2.41 (for the two years), compared to the 2.61 and 31 during 1998 and 1999 respectively, for P. gossypiella. The correlation value "r" between S. littoralis in sex-pheromone and light traps was positive and significant during 1998 (0.8907) and higher than that of 1999 (0.6013). The "r" value between the numbers of P. gossypiella male moths, caught in sex-pheromone and in light traps during 1998 (0.7467) and 1999 (0.8801) was also positive and significant.

TI  - Regression modelling to predict sugarcane stalk borer, Chilo auricilius
AB  - A field experiment was conducted in Haryana, India from 1990-91 to 1999-2000 to predict the stalk borer infestation on sugarcane (cultivars CoJ 64 and Co 1148) in relation to climatic factors. Minimum temperature and sunshine were negatively correlated, while the maximum temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were positively correlated with stalk borer infestation. In both cultivars, almost a similar trend of population fluctuation was observed, except that stalk borer incidence was slightly lower in CoJ 64 than in the late cultivar Co 1148. Regression studies indicated that temperature, rainfall and humidity conditions prevailing during July-August were optimum for pest build-up. The coefficient of determination R2 value of 0.60-0.86 suggested a very good account of variability attributed to these factors.

TI  - Larval movement and its potential impact on the management of the obliquebanded leafroller (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - The rate at which obliquebanded leafroller (Choristoneura rosaceana) larvae vacated feeding sites in apple (Malus domestica [M. pumila]) trees was determined by monitoring infested terminal foliage under field conditions. The overwintering and summer generations of C. rosaceana were monitored in two orchards in 1997 and 1998. Larvae vacated terminal feeding sites relatively frequently because 50% of the sites during the overwintering and summer generations were vacant 346d (threshold=6C) and 5310d, respectively, after sites had been marked. Vacancy rates increased from the beginning to the end of the summer generation in 1997 but remained relatively constant throughout the summer generation in 1998. The differences between the 2 years were probably because of less precipitation and lower availability of actively growing terminal foliage at the end of the summer in 1997 than in 1998. Differences in larval development did not seem to contribute to differences in vacancy rate. Recolonization of growing terminals was also studied in the field by removing C. rosaceana larvae from terminals only (1997) and the entire tree (1998). In 1997 and 1998, larval recolonization of terminals and trees occurred, because 6-8 d after larvae were removed populations in removal and adjacent control trees were not significantly different. Frequent larval movement to actively growing terminal foliage with sublethal insecticide residues may increase larval survival and could slow resistance development by providing a refuge for susceptible insects.

TI  - Population trends of codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) in Murree hills of Pakistan
AB  - Studies were conducted on population dynamics of codling moth in various localities of Murree hills of Pakistan (Osia, Dehla and Aliot) which are the major apple growing areas. Six traps containing sex pheromone lures were installed in various orchards of each locality. The results showed that the maximum population of male moths per trap was captured in the month of June in all the localities. The population decreased in July and again increased in August which gradually declined afterwards. No moth was recorded up to 1 and 15 April 2000 at Dehla and Osia, respectively. Similarly no population was observed at Aliot from 30 October 1999 to 13 May 2000. It showed that the population trend was somewhat different at Aliot compared with that at Osia and Dehla. The data showed two population peaks, i.e. in June and August, in almost all the localities. Significant differences were observed across the sample dates and between the localities when the male moths captured in these localities were compared.

TI  - Long-term studies in British woodland
AB  - The papers in this volume were presented at the British Ecological Society symposium held in the Oxford Forestry Institute on 13 July 1999. The aim was to bring together examples of different types of long-term monitoring in the UK. The papers (14) and posters/short papers (3) explore changes in British woods over periods ranging from 5 to 50 years in trees and shrubs, ground flora, invertebrates and birds. The work described deals both with natural processes such as stand dynamics, population cycles, phenology and interactions of plant host and invertebrates; and with human-induced effects - woodland management, air pollution and climatic change. As important as the results of the studies themselves, are the common threads that emerge with respect to the establishment and maintenance of long-term studies, the archiving and publishing of results, and the tension between trying to design systems are simple and might be useful to future researchers. The papers are The human element in long term woodland studies; Long-term stand change in a near-natural oakwood on Clairinsh Island, Scotland (Mountford, E.

TI  - Codling moth management by means of pheromone stations with Cydia pomonella granulosis virus
AB  - The potential of attractant-aided dissemination of pathogens in field populations of insect pests is examined. The codling moth males are attracted into codlemone baited pheromone stations (modified pheromone traps) coated inside with Cydia pomonella granulosis virus (CpGV). A special pheromone station (CpGv-pheromone station) suitable for contamination of the attracted males was developed and used in field trials in the Czech Republic. The field trials with CpGV-pheromone stations started in 1995. In 1997, the stations were exposed on 16 plots at 8 different locations and 4 small apple orchards. Changes in codling moth abundance were monitored using sticky pheromone traps, cardboard strips and by examining the fruit damage. Transfer of the viral infection from CpGV-pheromone stations by attracted males to females and to larvae was documented. Preliminary results with contamination suggest that both population density and fruit damage are decreased, compared to control plots. Since 1997, direct spray of CpGV and with combinations of direct spray and pheromone stations have been studied and the results are presented.

The adults preferred ovipositing on tomato plants, while the newly-hatched larvae preferred young cotton leaves which supported their growth better than the other plants. The early 6th-instar larvae utilized cotton boll and the reproductive organs of tobacco and hot pepper more effectively than tomato fruits. The larval survival rate was up to 83.6% on cotton compared with only 7.3% on tomato. However, the duration of the larval period on cotton and tomato were almost the same, being longer on tobacco and hot pepper. The female moths on cotton had the highest oviposition, while those on tobacco had the lowest. The population trend index on cotton was about 14 times higher than that on tomato.

TI  - The phenology of Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), Tortrix capensana (Walker) and Cryptophlebia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) on citrus at Zebediela, South Africa
AB  - A long-term study of the population cycles of Helicoverpa armigera, Tortrix capensana and Cryptophlebia leucotreta on citrus at Zebediela, South Africa, was undertaken to establish a phenological model for the planning and implementation of control strategies. Helicoverpa armigera and T. capensana were monitored with light traps and orchard scouting. In H. armigera, the relationships between adult activity, oviposition on citrus blossoms, the presence of larvae on citrus trees and the correlation between moth activity and climatic factors were determined. A correlation between moth activity in autumn and pest status the following spring was demonstrated. Although the oviposition levels on Navel blossoms were higher than on Valencia, both cultivars were subject to an oviposition peak in the first week of September. The larval population peaked on both cultivars in the third week of September during full bloom. Larvae appeared earlier on Navel but persisted longer on Valencia. In a simple regression analysis, light trap catches were correlated with minimum and maximum temperatures, evaporation, and wind and saturation deficit. In a multiple regression analysis a positive correlation was demonstrated between minimum temperature and wind, and moth catches. The packhouse culling figure owing to damage by H. armigera damage for 1986-93 was 0.43% (S.D.=0.27) for Navel and 0.29% (S.D.=0.25) for Valencia fruit. Tortrix capensana activity in winter and the following spring were correlated through light trap catches. The adult population with the highest economic impact on citrus fruit quality occurred in the fourth week of September. Larvae produced by these moths appeared two weeks later. Subsequent moth generations between December and May were of no economic importance. In a simple regression analysis, light trap catches showed the highest positive correlation with ambient temperature. In a multiple regression analysis evaporation and rainfall correlated positively with moth catches. The packhouse cull averaged 0.64% (S.D.=0.68%) on Navels and 0.52% (S.D.=0.56%) on Valencias. Lemons were not damaged. Male populations of C. leucotreta were monitored with virgin female traps. The highest moth activity occurred in the second week of February. The relationship between moth catches and climatic factors were investigated, as well as the pattern and number of fruit lost as a result of C. leucotreta in Navel and Valencia orchards. The highest single incidence of Navel fruit loss occurred in December and Valencia fruit loss in July. In a simple regression analysis, weekly moth catches showed a correlation with minimum and maximum temperature, evaporation and rainfall. In a multiple regression analysis maximum temperature correlated positively and evaporation negatively with moth catches. A relationship between moth catches and fruit loss was established. According to a regression between moth catches and Navel fruit loss, a weekly average of 10 males trap-1 22 ha-1 of trees per week resulted in a loss of 0.53 cartons of fruit ha-1 week-1 four weeks later. The average percentage crop loss due to false codling moth was 1.6% in Navels and 0.3% in Valencias.

TI  - Water loss dynamics during the pupal stage of the cotton bollworm at extreme humidities
AB  - Performance and body water dynamics in the pupal stage of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, were investigated at 25C and 0, 9, 22.5, 80, 92 and 100% relative humidity (RH). The non-diapause pupae failed to emerge at RH9% and about 20% of them succeeded in eclosion at 22.5% RH. The high humidities showed little effect on their survival. The diapausing individuals rarely died at all the humidities tested except 0% RH for 30 days, during which the diapause termination percent increased with decreasing humidity. Significant linear relationships were found between the rate of cumulative water loss in both diapause and non-diapause pupae. The non-diapause pupae that died at each of the low RHs lost more than 32% of their body water on the day before death. The mean water loss in the diapausing specimens at 0% RH for one month averaged 22.4% and those at RH90% did not exceed 3.6% in the same period. At 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h, the cuticular permeabilities of the pupae of different specimens were always greater than those obtained with identical specimens except at 2 h. The maximum permeability of the non-diapause pupae, 9.0 and 10.7 g cm-2 h-1 mm Hg-1 for female and male, respectively, occurred in 4 h, while that of the diapausing individuals, 4.7 and 5.4 g cm-2 h-1 mm Hg-1, respectively, occurred in 2 h.

TI  - Distribution of pyralid moths in warehouses and food processing factories in Portugal and the Cape Verde islands
AB  - A survey was carried out to monitor pyralid moth populations inside two processing facilities and four food warehouses in Portugal, as well as in two silos and 19 stores on the Cape Verde islands. In the processing facilities and in two food stores the main pest was Ephestia cautella [Cadra cautella]. In almond and maize stores Plodia interpunctella was the dominant species. E. cautella, Corcyra cephalonica and P. interpunctella were found in the silos and food warehouses in Cape Verde. Pheromone traps proved to be excellent devices for detecting low population levels of adult moths and deserve implementation into pest management strategy of storage and processing environments.

TI  - The developmental and physiological basis of body size evolution in an insect
AB  - The evolution of body size is a dominant feature of animal evolution. However, little is known about how the underlying developmental mechanisms that determine size change as body size evolves. Here we report on a case of body size evolution in the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta that occurred over a period of nearly 30 years. We take advantage of an extensive series of physiological studies performed in the early 1970s that established the parameters that regulate body size in this species and compare their values with those of modern individuals that are descendants of the same colony. We show that three of the five processes that determine adult body size changed during this period, while two remained constant. Changes in these three developmental processes completely account for the observed evolutionary change in body size.

TI  - Monitoring of rice yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas Walker using pheromone traps and thermal summations
AB  - Monitoring studies were carried out at Medchal, Andhra Pradesh, India from the kharif season of 1996 to the rabi season of 1997 on rice yellow stem borer (YSB), Scirpophaga incertulas using a natural blend (31) of (Z)-11-hexadecenal and (Z)-9-hexadecenal. Three peak periods of moth activity were observed during the kharif season (July, August, September) and two during the rabi season (January and March/April). Late planted crop was more affected than the early planted crop. It was evident from the temporal relationship between peak periods of pheromone trap catches and field infestation that peak dead heart and white ear infestation occur 2 and 3 weeks after the peak or sudden increase in moth captures, respectively. From the regression equation worked out with trap catch and field infestation data, the trap capture of 30 and 19 male moths/week/trap seemed to result in 10% dead heart and 5% white ears, respectively. When catches exceed 30 male moths/trap/week and about 95-110C accumulate from such time (degree days accumulated up to hatching), the timing of insecticide application is considered as effective and economical, as the time synchronizes with the occurrence of first instar larvae. Both larval development and adult emergence of YSB were affected at temperatures below 16C and above 35C. Maximum temperatures of 29-30C and minimum of 20C were the most favourable for YSB development. Under these conditions, development from egg to adult is completed in 430 to 530C degree days (DD), while under adverse conditions (below 16 or above 35C) 630 to 670C DD would be required to complete the development.

TI  - Mating disruption, classical control an population dynamic of grape moths. / Technique de confusion, lutte classique et dynamique des populations des vers de la grappe
AB  - Damage rates of pests, grapevine moth Lobesia botrana and particularly grape berry moth Eupoecilia ambiguella have strongly increased since 1997 in Switzerland. The pest pressure reached an exceptional level in the first generation of 2000 and clearly decreased in the second generation. Whatever the control methods, mating disruption or classical control, population densities of the pests fluctuated similarly from 1995 to 2000 in Switzerland. In most cases, mating disruption achieved better results than classical control. However, in some regions such as the Chablais, or during exceptional years such as 2000, complementary treatments were necessary.

TI  - Climate change and outbreaks of geometrid moths in the North. / Temperaturfrndringar och utbrott av mtarfjrilar i norr
AB  - The anticipated climate changes will probably affect northern and high altitude areas most. Northern populations of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) and the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) recurrently reach outbreak densities in the mountain birch forests [Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa] of Fennoscandia. Many aspects of these insects have been studied in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Much is known about the population dynamics and interactions between the insect herbivores and their natural enemies and the mountain birch. The dynamics of the system is not yet fully understood, but temperature is an important factor directly affecting the distribution of moths and temporal and spatial dynamics. Low winter temperatures may cause extensive egg mortality. Furthermore, temperatures do affect all trophic levels in the system and the interactions between them. Higher yearly mean temperatures may mean both warmer winters and summers. This may affect the survival and performance of different life stages of moths in adverse ways, increased egg survival and reduced larval survival. Thus, predictions about outbreak occurrence and frequency are hard to make without a better understanding of the system at current conditions. The distribution ranges of moths may be extended into new areas but the frequency of outbreaks is harder to predict. Further, more knowledge about the anticipated effects of climate change, i.e. variation in temperature and precipitation, are also desirable.

TI  - In vivo characterization of Lopap, a prothrombin activator serine protease from the Lonomia obliqua caterpillar venom
AB  - Increasing occurrence of haemorrhagic syndrome in man, caused by contact with Lonomia obliqua caterpillars, has been reported in Southern Brazil in the past 10 years (since 1989). The L. obliqua venom causes a severe consumptive coagulopathy, which can lead to haemorrhagic syndrome. L. obliqua prothrombin activator protease (Lopap) is a 69-kDa prothrombin activator serine protease isolated from L. obliqua caterpillar bristle extract, which is able to evoke thrombus formation, unclottable blood, and fibrinogen depletion when injected into the blood stream of rats. The purified protein generated thrombin from prothrombin, able to clot purified human fibrinogen and plasma. A decrease in platelet count and inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation were observed, as well as leukocyte infiltration in the lungs. In addition, we observed congestion and haemorrhage in renal glomeruli and necrosis in renal distal tubules. These data support the hypothesis that Lopap contributes to the clinical syndrome caused by human contact with L. obliqua, most probably through prothrombin activation, resulting in a consumption coagulopathy.

TI  - Effect of the distance between sex pheromone or light traps and Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) egg-masses on hatchability percentage in the cotton fields
AB  - Studies were conducted in El-Minia Governorate, Egypt, during 1998 and 1999 to determine the relationship between the number of S. littoralis male moths attracted to either sex pheromone or light traps placed at different distances and the hatchability percentages of egg masses deposited on cotton plants. The daily catch number of moths in both traps were further grouped into 3 daily averages. In each area, 3 egg masses were marked at distances of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 m from the trap. The egg masses were examined every 3 days starting from 4 June till 1 July to estimate the hatchability percentage. The hatchability percentages of egg masses differed from one time to another and according to their location in the field. In the cotton area supplied with the baited sex pheromone trap, the highest general percentages of egg mass hatchability during 1998 and 1999 were 89.73 on 19 June and 99.24 on 28 June at a distance of 30 m from the trap site, while the highest general average percentages for the whole inspections and distances were 65.65 and 71.45 during 1998 and 1999, respectively. Concerning the area supplied with the light trap, the highest general hatchability percentages of egg masses during 1998 and 1999 were 93.78 on 28 June and 97.48 on 4 June at a distance of 25 m from the light trap, while the highest general average percentages for the whole inspections and distances during the 2 seasons were 75.87 and 74.37, respectively. A significant negative relationship occurred between the captured male moths in the sex pheromone trap and the hatchability percentages of egg masses during the 2 cotton seasons expressed as correlation coefficient values 'r' (-0.7220 and -0.6718). The same relationship (negative and significant) was recorded between the number of captured male moths in the light trap and the correspondent hatchability percentages during 1998 and 1999 (r=-0.6390 and -0.6120). These results represented the opposite relationship between the population of captured male moths and egg mass hatchability, i.e. the number of captured male moths increased in the trap, the percentage of egg mass hatchability decreased in the field.

TI  - Interesting records of Lepidoptera in the taiga- and tundra regions of Sweden 1999. / Intressanta fynd av fjllfjrilar i Sverige 1999
AB  - This is the sixth report on interesting finds and events from the Swedish mountain range and adjacent areas, which are generally not reported in the national lists for Micro- and Macrolepidoptera. The summer weather in 1999 was reversed in comparison with the previous year. The only cold and wet spot in the country this summer was the mountains of north-westernmost Sweden. However, in the last days of June there was a spell of warm weather also in this area. Despite the good weather, extremely few Acerbia alpina pupated this year and most lepidopteran species occurred in lower numbers than average on Nissuntjrro, perhaps with the exception of Apotomis lemniscatana and Cydia aureolana. The southern half of the Swedish mountain range had an exceptionally sunny summer, but unfortunately very few Lepidoptera. As predicted after the previous very poor season many species were found in low numbers or not at all. The Xestia species, which mainly - but not only - flies even years, were almost totally absent. Almost none of the "southern" species which have established themselves in this region during the warm summers of the 1980-90s could be found this year. The only species that occurred abundantly was Epirrita autumnata which had its second year of a mass-occurrence in western Hrjedalen this season.

TI  - Seasonal variation in leaf characteristics and food selection by larval noctuids on an evergreen Mediterranean shrub
AB  - Despite year round availability of foliage, abundance of generalist noctuid larvae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in evergreen-dominated Mediterranean forests has a narrow, distinct spring peak. This restricted larval period has been suggested to result in part from avoidance of the nutritionally poor mature foliage, and preference for nutritionally superior spring-produced young leaves. This study examines this hypothesis by (i) documenting differences in nutritional characteristics between expanding (April) and mature (June) young leaves of the evergreen Mediterranean shrub Daphne laureola L. (Thymelaeaceae), and (ii) experimentally studying the feeding preferences of noctuid larvae for young leaves, old leaves (1 yr old), and developing fruits of this species in one south-eastern Spanish locality. Young leaves of D. laureola declined in nutrient concentration and specific dry mass from April to June. The responses of noctuid larvae, in terms of both relative preference and total consumption, to this seasonal variation in chemical and physical features of young leaves were also investigated. When noctuid larvae were simultaneously offered young leaves, old leaves and developing fruits, they exhibited similar preferences for young leaves and developing fruits, and rejected old leaves developed during the previous year. Noctuid larvae did not modify their consumption of young leaves relative to old leaves and developing fruits in response to seasonal changes. Food selection patterns exhibited by D. laureola noctuid herbivores, notably the rejection of old leaves in favour of young ones, are consistent with the hypothesis relating to restricted larval periods of these generalist consumers with the low food value of the previous season leaves of evergreen Mediterranean plants.

TI  - Infestation with cotton leafworm and bollworms in relation to pheromone and light trap catches in cotton fields
AB  - The present study was conducted at Sakha Agricultural Research Station, Egypt, during 1994 and 1995 cotton seasons. The relationship between cotton leafworm and bollworms population and field infestations was investigated. Adult populations of Spodoptera littoralis, Pectinophora gossypiella and Earias insulana were more attracted to pheromone traps than to light traps. From the total catch, pheromone baited traps attracted 76.38, 78.74 and 93.46, respectively, in 1994. On the second season 1995 they attracted 76.39, 88.12 and 61.98% of adults of the three pests, respectively. They were also better at detecting pest populations particularly early in the growing season. A weak correlation between S. littoralis adult catch and egg deposition were calculated in spite of high adult catch by both types of traps. Bollworms adult population progressively increased toward late summer and early fall and then declined, but field infestation consistently increased due to accumulation of larvae. Correlation coefficient values (r) between percentage infestation and adults of P. gossypiella trapped by light and pheromone traps were 0.41 and 0.91 in the first season. A similar trend was noticed during the second season for light-trapped adults, but not for the pheromone-trapped adults. The correlation values between percentage infestation of E. insulana and number of trapped adults were higher in pheromone traps than light traps. In conclusion, as the number of field adults fluctuates and crop infestation depends on many factors, direct examination of cotton fields is strongly recommended to detect population changes, for planning insecticide applications, if required.

TI  - Development of insect population dynamics and forecast models a case of Chilo suppressalis (Walker) occurrence in Suwon
AB  - The long-term trend and pattern changes of Chilo suppressalis (Walker) occurrence in Suwon, Korea Republic were analyzed, and the forecasting models for spring emergence of C. suppressalis in Suwon were developed. From 1965 to 1996, the population dynamics of C. suppressalis in Suwon showed a cyclic fluctuation with one large peak and one small peak, and its periodicity was ca. 36 generations (18 years). C. suppressalis population dynamics in Suwon was characterized as controlled by the endogenous dynamics dictated by the 1st order negative feedback mechanism (fast density dependence). The dynamics mechanism of C. suppressalis populations was not changed although its population density decreased drastically over the years. Using the data of C. suppressalis spring occurrence in Suwon, forecasting models for spring emergence of C. suppressalis were developed based on temperature-dependent development model or degree days. In general, these models described the C. suppressalis spring emergence pattern in Suwon. Also, forecasting problems in spring moth emergence related to C. suppressalis population dynamics were discussed.

TI  - Biological control of horehound lessons from South Australia
AB  - The biological control program against horehound [Marrubium vulgare] in South Australia has focused on evaluation of the horehound plume moth, Wheeleria spilodactylus (Curtis), and initial releases of the horehound clearwing moth, Chamaesphecia mysiniformis Rambur. The plume moth has established at 37 of the 51 release sites studied in South Australia. The current rate of population increase in the plume moth, greater than 100 fold annually, appears to be enough to cover South Australia with horehound-suppressing densities of larvae in less than five years. However, the spread of populations away from release sites indicates that it will take 27 500 years for the plume moth to become distributed across the whole of South Australia. This could be over-come by actively redistributing the moth to many more sites. The horehound clearwing moth was released at three sites in 1999. The status of this insect will not be known until the end of this year. Evaluation of the impact of these biological control agents is desirable to determine their impact, to justify future redistribution efforts and to determine if additional natural enemies should be imported to enhance biological control.

TI  - Relative abundance of rice stem borer species in Tamil Nadu
AB  - A survey was conducted during the kar (June-September) and pishanum (October-January) seasons [year not given], in Killikulam, Tamil Nadu, India, to evaluate the seasonal occurrence and relative abundance of 3 rice stem borer species, i.e. the yellow stem borer (YSB, Scirpophaga incertulas), the pink stem borer (PSB, Sesamia inferens) and the dark-headed borer (DHB, Chilo polychrysus). YSB was the most predominant species in both the kar (60.0%) and pishanum seasons (48.43%). PSB was the second most predominant species in kar (35.21%) and was as abundant as YSB in pishanum (48.43%). DSB was least abundant during either season (4.29-7.18%). Screening of commercial rice cultivars (ASD 19, ADT 39 and IR 20) revealed that these cultivars had more infestation by YSB and PSB than by DHB. YSB infestation was predominant from early tillering to maximum tillering stage, and decreased gradually with increasing PSB infestation from the flowering stage. Evaluation of species composition, by random survey of Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari, Madurai, Thanjavur, Coimbatore, Dharmapuri and Vellore districts, revealed that YSB was the most common species in all districts.

TI  - Causes of cyclicity of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera, Geometridae) grandiose theory and tedious practice
AB  - Creating multiyear cycles in population density demands, in traditional models, causal factors that operate on local populations in a density-dependent way with time lags. However, cycles of the geometrid Epirrita autumnata in northern Europe may be regional, not local; i.e., successive outbreaks occur in different localities. We review possible causes of cycles of E. autumnata under both local and regional scenarios, including large-scale synchrony. Assuming cyclicity is a local phenomenon, individual populations of E. autumnata display peaks but populations all over the outbreak range fluctuate in synchrony. This concept assumes that the peaks at most localities are so low that they do not lead to visible defoliation and easily remain unnoticed. In this scenario, populations are able to start recovery a few years after the crash, i.e., at the time of the mitigation of detrimental delayed density-dependent factors, such as delayed inducible resistance of the host plant or parasitism. In that case, the same factors that lead to crashes also explain the periodicity of cyclic fluctuations. According to the regional cyclicity scenario, different factors can be important in different phases of the cycle. The key is to identify the factors that tend to produce outbreaks with a periodicity of about 10 years. Initiation of the increase phase seems to coincide with maxima in sunspot activity, but causal connections remain unclear. Climatic factor(s) associated with the solar cycle could contribute to the large-scale geographic synchrony.

TI  - Survival in space and time flexibility and variability guarantee reproductive success in the burnet moth Zygaena trifolii. / (ber-) Leben in Raum und Zeit Flexibilitt und Variabilitt als Erfolgsgaranten fr den Reproduktionserfolg beim Blutstrpfchen-Schmetterling Zygaena trifolii
AB  - Insects adjust their life cycles to the seasonally variable environmental conditions, so that growth, development and reproduction coincide with favourable seasons and adverse seasons are passed in a species-specific resistant stage. Life cycle traits are intimately associated with reproductive success, and yet a high degree of phenotypic variability is sometimes observed. Unfortunately, it is normally not known whether this variability is based on genetic differences among individuals or on phenotypic plasticity. A high degree of phenotypic variability was observed in the diapause response of the burnet moth Z. trifolii. It is a "long-day insect" with temperature-influenced photoperiodic responses, and larval diapause may occur at the 3rd or any subsequent larval instar. The observed variability is partly based on genetic differences between individuals. In a selection experiment, the larval instar at which diapause occurs was changed within six generations. Diapause instars were dependent on the time of pre-diapause development of larvae, which varied considerably between larvae. A part of the variability in development time is based on additive genetic variance. Genetic variability in life cycle traits closely associated with reproductive success is normally eroded by strong natural selection on such traits. One may speculate, that the maintenance of genetic variability in the diapause response of Z. trifolii may result from temporal changes in selection pressure close to the border of the distribution range, where unsuitable weather conditions prevent successful reproduction in some years.

TI  - Spatial characteristics of the occurrence of pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea Schiff.) larvae in stands of the Tuczno Forest District. / Przestrzenna charakterystyka wystepowania larw strzygoni choinwki (Panolis flamea Schiff.) w drzewostanach Nadlenictwa Tuczno
AB  - Observations on the occurrence of pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea) larvae were carried out in pine [Pinus sylvestris] stands of the Tuczno Forest District, Poland, in 1996-98. Droppings falling onto the ground were used as evidence of the occurrence of larvae in tree crowns; the droppings were collected, and their mass and the number of pellets were counted, and the values calculated on a square metre basis. The dependence of dropping mass and density on stand characteristics was assessed using the Pearsons correlation coefficient and spatial analysis. Considerable differences in the mass and density of droppings were found between control plots in the first year and on the same control plots in successive years of observation. There was a distinct increase in mass and density of droppings on the study plots with time, indicating the presence of greater and greater numbers of larvae in the tree crowns. There were no significant relationships between the mass and density of droppings and features of the test stands and control trees - the highest relationship was found with stand age, where the correlation coefficient was about 0.30 at the 0.95 confidence level. A patchy character of the occurrence of larvae was very clear, especially in the first year of observations, when the droppings indicated that there was a relatively low level of larvae. In the succeeding years, the growing mass and density of droppings on control indicated an increase of larval numbers in crowns, with new patches of more abundant occurrence of larvae appearing, and at the same time, the patchy character of their occurrence continually disappearing. The primary patches of more abundant occurrence of larvae overlapped with the areas of stands that were defined as threatened, based on the level of degradation found in the epigeic carabid fauna.

TI  - Seasonal distribution of Herpetogramma licarsisalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in northern Northland
AB  - The presence of H. licarsisalis (tropical grass webworm) larvae in pasture 40 km north of Kaitaia on the Aupouri Peninsula, Northland, New Zealand, was confirmed in March 1999. A survey was undertaken in late March 1999 using spade sampling and sack survey techniques. The main locus of infestation (ca. 37 000 ha) was centred on Pukenui, and a secondary infestation (30-40 ha) was identified 20 km south of Cape Reinga. Infestations were restricted to kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) pastures. H. licarsisalis population densities declined over the winter (June-September 1999). In March 1999 larvae were present at 64% of sites sampled but by early September 1999 were only present at 7% of sites sampled. Sites where H. licarsisalis were present in July and September 1999 were characterized by well drained north facing slopes. In Northland, H. licarsisalis is at the limits of its geographical range. The possibility that this is a short-term establishment and sporadic event is discussed.

TI  - Mating disruption and classical control of grape moths in canton Vaud's vineyards in 1999. / Lutte par confusion et lutte classique contre les vers de la grappe dans les vignobles vaudois en 1999
AB  - In Switzerland, mating disruption to control grape moth, Lobesia botrana, and grape berry moth, Eupoecilia ambiguella, has expanded very rapidly; in 1999 it covered over 4500 ha, representing 30% of Swiss grape acreage. The present paper compares classical treatment to mating disruption by counting of bunches damaged by two generations of both pests sampled in vineyards. Grape moths' pressure, especially that of E. ambiguella, increased strongly during the last few years but, independently of control method, it varied greatly between the different regions. Mating disruption, as well as classical control, achieved good results where pest pressure was low. But, both couldn't avoid an increase in population density where initial pressure was high, so that complementary treatments were then necessary. In most cases, mating disruption proved to be slightly more efficient than classical control. Initial pest pressure seemed to have more influence on successful insect control than dispenser density or type.

TI  - Field attractiveness of the synthetic sex pheromone of the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel (LepidopteraNocutuidae) and seasonal attractant prevalence in the Oshima District of Hokkaido
AB  - The attractiveness of a synthetic pheromone to the black cutworm, A. ipsilon, was monitored by sticky traps from 1992 to 1995 in southern Hokkaido, Japan. A. ipsilon adults were captured from May to early July and from late July to early September. Moths were not captured in large numbers by light traps, with the total catch by pheromone trap being 1.8-8.6 times greater than light traps. Pheromone traps were more efficient for population monitoring than light traps. The attractiveness of 3 dosages of synthetic pheromone (0.2, 1 and 3 mg) was assessed in the field. It is suggested that a 1 mg dose of synthetic pheromone was suitable for monitoring A. ipsilon at low population densities. Macdunnoughia confusa adults were also caught by pheromone traps for A. ipsilon. It was considered that M. confusa might utilize the same sex pheromone components.

TI  - Monitoring codling moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) with passive interception traps in sex pheromone-treated apple orchards
AB  - Male and female codling moth, Cydia pomonella, were monitored with passive interception traps (PI-traps) in apple orchards treated with sex pheromone dispensers. The proportion of mated females recaptured by PI-traps was significantly higher than the proportion released after the release of both sexes into a codling moth-infested orchard. However, no significant differences occurred between the proportion of mated females recaptured and released when only females were released into uninfested orchards. Replicated nine-tree apple plots situated either on the edge or in the centre of pheromone-treated apple orchards were monitored with PI-traps during the first moth flight in 1995 and during both flights in 1996. Moths caught on PI-traps were predominately males. The first male moths were captured 7-10 days before females during the first flight in both years. Initial capture of virgin and mated females on PI-traps coincided in 1995. Mated females were captured 14 days after the first virgin females in 1996. The mean proportion of females that were mated ranged from 32 to 55% during the first flight and from 85 to 92% during the second flight. Moth catch and fruit injury were significantly higher in the edge versus the centre plots. The numbers of total and female moths caught with PI-traps were significantly correlated with fruit injury for each generation. The percentage of female moths caught on PI-traps that were mated was 32% lower and the mean oocyte load of all females was 42% higher in a pheromone-treated apple orchard than in the untreated crabapple grove monitored during May and June 1997.

TI  - Dispersal an important driving force of the cyclic population dynamics of the larch bud moth, Zeiraphera diniana Gn
AB  - From 1949 to 1989 four population cycles of the larch (Larix decidua) bud moth, Zeiraphera diniana, were monitored in the larval stage in five subalpine valleys of the European Alps. The analysis of lambda (), the finite rate of population increase, in the subalpine optimum area and the suboptimum area in the Swiss Central Plateau (Mittelland) was employed to differentiate between local population dynamics and the potential impact of immigration. Maximum population densities throughout the Alps are characterized by the defoliation patterns of the larch forests. Mapping these patterns provided the magnitude of potential exodus areas. Furthermore, the behaviour of the moths and the particular weather patterns that induce migration complement each other in ways that can explain changes in . The analysis of specific cases of larch bud moth outbreaks illustrates the importance of long-distance dispersal in cyclic population dynamics.

TI  - Factors affecting feeding site preferences of lightbrown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), on apple trees in New Zealand
AB  - The infestation of apple (Malus domestica) trees by Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) larvae was studied over 3 years in Nelson and Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. Fresh damage to leaves increased progressively during the season, although in Nelson it declined in April. Fruit damage was first detected in December and increased throughout the season. The incidence of fruit damage was most strongly correlated with the surface area of fruit. Single leaves were the preferred feeding site for larvae on terminal shoots, although when whole branches were examined, most shelters occurred between two leaves. Feeding sites on fruit predominantly involved contact with a leaf or another apple. A field experiment examined the influence of physical contact and fruit maturation on leafroller damage. E. postvittana larvae were offered a choice of feeding sites involving leaves and three types of "apple"; namely untreated apples, apples treated with chlorethephon to promote ripening, and plastic balls. There was 16% more damage on treated compared with untreated fruit, but similar levels of damage to leaves touching the three types of apple. Although riper fruit were more attractive to E. postvittana larvae, their preference for physical contact had a greater influence on the selection of feeding sites. The increase in fruit damage over time was mainly due to the increasing extent of contact between leaves and other fruit as the apples enlarged.

TI  - A reappraisal of the population dynamics of the pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea, on lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, in Scotland
AB  - The pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea, is a defoliating pest of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests in Scotland. This article reviews early and recent research on the population ecology of Panolis flammea and presents an analysis of pupal survey data collected between 1977 and 1993. Research in the 1980s suggested that natural enemies, although effective in preventing P. flammea outbreaks on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), played an insignificant role in the population dynamics of P. flammea on lodgepole pine. However, analysis of pupal survey data showed that delayed density-dependent action of natural enemies, probably parasitoids, was overlooked during the 1970s and 1980s. Recent research suggests that fungal pathogens are responsible for a decline in the frequency and severity of outbreaks of P. flammea on lodgepole pine. This suggestion, together with the overlooked importance of other natural enemies, indicates that the population ecology of P. flammea in Scotland has changed during the past 20 years and requires a full reappraisal.

TI  - Mass-trapping of pink bollworm with gossyplure
AB  - Field experiments were conducted during two cotton seasons (1996 and 1997) at Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt, to evaluate the efficiency of a mass-trapping technique for pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) control. Five densities of one delta sticky trap per 1, 2, 5, 10 or 15 feddan were tested using the sex pheromone 'gossyplure' and compared with the mating disruption technique using PB-ROPE dispensers during the 1996 season. In 1997, more abundant mass-trapping densities (1, 2, 3 or 5 traps per feddan) were tested. In relation to the reduction of the insect population and increasing seed cotton yield, the results showed that use of five sex pheromone traps per feddan for mass-trapping male moths was equivalent to using 300 PB-ROPE dispensers per feddan. These treatments also reduced the number of insecticide sprays needed when boll infestation by pink bollworm exceeded the 3% level.

TI  - Biology of Agapeta zoegana (Lepidoptera Cochylidae), propagated for the biological control of knapweeds (Asteraceae)
AB  - We examined the influence of temperature and release density on the root-boring moth, A. zoegana, a biological control agent of diffuse knapweed, Centaurea diffusa, and spotted knapweed, Centaurea maculosa. Moths were released at six densities (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 adult male-female pairs) in each of 2 years (1992 and 1993 cohorts) into outdoor, caged plots containing spotted knapweed. Air temperature, larval establishment and mass, and adult emergence, mass, and body dimensions were measured. Larval production increased linearly with adult release density in both cohorts. Larval survival ranged from 0 to 100% and was not correlated with release density or accumulated degree-days in either year. Date of first emergence occurred earlier as both release density and larvae per plant increased, but only for the 1992 cohort. Declining resources or increased contact among the larvae may induce early pupation. Peak emergence rate increased with release density in both cohorts. First emergence was related more closely to calendar date than accumulated degree-days. In contrast, peak emergence rates were more consistent with degree-day accumulations between cohorts than calendar date. Adult production increased with parental release density in both cohorts. Females were heavier, wider, and longer than males. Optimum A. zoegana production will be achieved with releases of greater than 1.6 male-female adult pairs per spotted knapweed plant.

TI  - Population fluctuation and seasonal history of yellow rice stem borer in rice growing area of Sindh
AB  - The seasonal history of the yellow rice stem borer, Tryporyza incertulas Wlk. was studied with the help of adult activity using light traps and larval population fluctuations as influenced by plant phenology. The light trap studies revealed that the first moth appeared during first week of March. The moth activity reached its peak during October and no moth was captured during December. The larval infestation of T. incertulas in rice plants was synchronized with the moth activity. Maximum larval infestation during vegetative growth stage was recorded during August and maximum white heads were recorded during October. The mean number of egg masses deposited by female moths was significantly the highest during August when the vegetative stage was at its peak.

TI  - Residual activity of capture 2EC and other pyrethroid insecticides as indicated by control of tobacco budworm on cotton
AB  - Capture 2EC (bifenthrin) has been extensively evaluated in field efficacy and laboratory bioassay trials during the past years for control of the major insect and mite pests of cotton. Several field-laboratory bioassays have demonstrated that the residual control achieved with Capture 2EC is longer than that achieved with Karate Z [lambda-cyhalothrin] or Baythroid 2EC [cyfluthrin]. Supporting the theory that the decreased photodegradation rate of Capture would result in greater biological control. These trials also revealed a more rapid decline in residual activity for Karate Z when compared to Karate 1EC. In the absence of rainfall, the level of Heliothis virescens (F.) control for Karate Z drops significantly between 4 and 6 days after treatment. Rainfall accelerated this decline with a significant drop in activity occurring less than 3 days after treatment.

TI  - The European grape berry moth Lobesia botrana as a pest of deciduous fruit plantations in Israel
AB  - The occurrence, population levels and damage caused by L. botrana was studied in the major stone and pome fruit growing areas in Israel from 1988-97. For comparison, the occurrence of larvae and adults were studied in vineyards. Fruit injury and larval population densities were assessed. The adults were monitored by traps baited with L. botrana sex pheromone. Information is also given on the typical feeding behaviour and feeding injury on the various species of stone and pome fruits. Severe damage was caused to plums and, to a lesser extent, to pears, apples and persimmons. L. botrana larvae were also collected from cherries, pomegranates, nectarines, peaches and loquats, and from flowers of other fruit trees and cut flowers. Present findings suggest that seasonal population trends of L. botrana in deciduous plantations are similar to those in vineyards. Clear relationships were found between adult males caught in pheromone traps in the spring and the occurrence of larvae in early summer. However, there was no correlation between the number of trapped males during the season and the rate of damage. Possible reasons for the increase in the economic importance of L. botrana in deciduous fruit plantations in Israel during the last decade are discussed.

TI  - Approximate number of annual field generations of pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders)
AB  - Field trials were carried out to estimate the number and duration of cotton bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) field generations during three seasons (1993, 1994 and 1995) at Gharbia & Kafr El-Sheikh Governorates and two seasons (1993 & 1994) for Beheira Governorate, to facilitate the graphical estimation for the population cycles in each locality separately. Pectinophora gossypiella adults appeared reliably during March, April and May, termed suicidal emergence, because it occurred before the most suitable food plant (cotton) was available. The weekly numbers of captured pink bollworm moth determined by sex pheromone traps indicate that the first emergence period demonstrated unreliable changes in the population cycles of moths, while the second period underwent four obvious peaks of four overlapping generations in the three tested localities.

TI  - Preliminary results of lepidoptera fauna investigations in Prekmurje (ne Slovenia)
AB  - A review of the lepidoptera fauna of Prekmurje, Slovenia is presented. Data from different sources and 66 locations were studied. A total of 955 species of Lepidoptera were recorded (686 Macrolepidoptera and 269 Microlepidoptera). The majority of species belonged to the families Noctuidae (258), Geometridae (198), Pyraloidea (97), Tortricidae (67) and 108 butterflies (Rhopalocera). Eight species were new Macrolepidoptera for Slovenia. The forest fauna prevailed, while meadow fauna was affected due to the intensive use of grass. Some characteristic and common species disappeared from meadows (Hypodryas maturna, Mellicta britomartis britomartis and Colias myrmidone), whereas others were appearing (Colias erate, Apamea sicula syriaca and Xestia cohaesa). Changes in abundance of some species were observed during the study, as well as the general decline in abundance of all the fauna under investigation, especially on cultivated areas. The geographical, geological and climatic characteristics and vegetation of Prekmurje are described.

TI  - Pear leafroller a simple matter of weed control?
AB  - In recent years pear leafroller (Epichoristodes acerbella) has become one of the most important pests of table grapes in the Hex River Valley, South Africa, with respect to fruit rejections by USDA inspectors. This has occurred despite an increase in the number of sprays applied per season against this pest. Shoot, grape and weed inspections have shown that leafroller is present in the vineyards throughout the year on the vines during the growing season and predominantly on weeds in the cover crop during the winter months.

TI  - Infestation intensity of Zeuzera conferta Walker (Cossidae Lepidoptera) in Sonneratia apetala plantations of Bangladesh
AB  - A survey was conducted during November 1996-January 1997 to assess the present status of infestation caused by the beehole borer, Zeuzera conferta (Cossidae Lepidoptera) in keora (Sonneratia apetala) plantations along the coastal belt of Bangladesh. The survey covered plantations raised in the four Coastal Afforestation Divisions, namely Patuakhali, Bhola, Noakhali and Chittagong of the Forest Directorate. The survey revealed an overall infestation of 20.9% with an average of 15.6, 16.6, 26.3 and 25.2% in the four divisions respectively. A number of plantation attributes, such as age (3-20 years), inundation duration (very low to very high levels with which the keora stand got tidally inundated in a year), canopy closure (open and closed), and stand composition (single species and mixed species), were evaluated for their correlation/association with the degree of infestation. The correlations between the degree of infestation and plantation age in Patuakhati (r=-0.28) and Bhola (r=-0.31) were non-significant, whereas those in Noakhali (r=-0.71) and Chittagong (r=-0.53) were significant. The infestation trend reached its peak at around the age of seven years and then decreased slowly. Infestation was higher in highly inundated (&gt;9 months inundation), open canopy and single species stands.

TI  - The simultaneous effect of physical environmental factors governing the population activity of cotton bollworm moths
AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the simultaneous effect of certain environmental physical factors on the population activity of pink and spiny bollworms during 1993, 1994 and 1995 seasons in three different localities (Gharbia & Kafr El-Sheikh and Beheira Governorates, Egypt). The relationship between accumulative thermal units and the corresponding population density of the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) was studied. The effect of maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity on the population density of Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) and Earias insulana (Boisd.) moths was also investigated. It appears from the results that a strong positive relationship prevailed between the changes in the population density of each generation and the required accumulative thermal units for the three years combined in the three tested localities. The effect of the three weather factors combined was relatively the highest for Gharbia, where the corresponding population size of Earias insulana was the least. A similar trend was observed for Pectinophora gossypiella.

TI  - Seasonal fluctuations of male moth catches of potato tubermoth Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)
AB  - Field trials were carried out to estimate the numbers and durations of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) in the field and under storage. Field effectiveness periods were determined during three seasons (1995, 1996 and 1997) at Gharbia and Menoufia Governorates and two seasons (1996 and 1997) for Qalubia Governorate, Egypt to facilitate the graphical estimation of the population cycles in each locality. Data indicted that the reliable appearance of P. operculella moths took place during summer (March-June) and winter (September-January) in the field, and from July to the beginning of September under storage. The weekly numbers of captured male moths determined by sex pheromone traps indicated that the first emergence period occurred during January and extended until June in the summer planting, while the second period was from July until September at storage and the third period from September until January. Obvious peaks of 10 overlapping seasonal fluctuations were detected in the three tested localities.

TI  - Population dynamics of summer fruit tortrix moth Adoxophyes orana F.v.R. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) in Western Serbia
AB  - Summer fruit tortrix moth, Adoxophyes orana, occurs regularly in almost all apple and pear commercial orchards in Serbia. It has caused considerable damage for many years. It was first observed in the vicinity of Belgrade in 1959. Summer fruit tortrix moth has been an economically important pest in fruit production since 1970 when considerable damage of apples and pears was recorded in the region of Western Serbia. The presence and increased population dynamics and the duration of embryo development should be considered in determining optimum terms for applying control treatments. The following fruit species were registered as hosts of summer fruit tortrix moth in Serbia apple, pear, quince, peach, apricot, plum, cherry, and sour cherry. Apple and pear were the most frequent hosts in our climatic conditions. Among numerous pear cultivars, the greatest damage was recorded for cv. Wiliams (58.0%). In the climatic conditions of Western Serbia, A. orana moths develop two generations in a year with the flight period in June and August. Summer fruit tortrix overwinters in the third larvae instar. The third instar larvae leave winter shelters in early April. The emergence of the first generation moth in the area under observation occurs in the second half of May and lasts till early July. The emergence of the second generation occurs in early August and the flight lasts till mid-September. The duration of embryo development in the field conditions is 8-15 days.

TI  - Climate change and the pine processionary caterpillar adaptation of a defoliator to changing environmental conditions. / Variazioni climatiche e processionaria del pino adattamenti di un defoliatore a condizioni ambientali mutevoli
AB  - The pine processionary caterpillar (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) is the most important insect defoliator of pines (Pinus spp.) in Italy. The increase in average temperature recorded over recent decades has resulted in a spread of this forest pest both to the north, and to higher altitudes. Observations were made in 1993-94 and 1994-95 of the first outbreak of T. pityocampa in a forest plantation (aged about 30 years old) of mixed pine species - dominated by black pine (P. nigra), with Swiss mountain pine (P. mugo) at higher altitudes and some Scots pine (P. sylvestris) - situated in the Orobian Prealps, Bergamo, at altitudes greater than 1000 m. The rise in the average minimum winter temperature (to which the pest is particularly susceptible), seems to be the factor responsible for the higher survival levels, and the remarkable population growth. Both P. nigra and P. mugo were defoliated, although usually P. mugo is not affected by this pest; however, larval performance was considerably lower on P. mugo. Heavy rain between September and October 1993, aggravated by unfavourable temperatures, resulted in total larval mortality in the first stage of development. However, trees were attacked by adults emerging from pupae that had undergone prolonged diapause. Populations of natural enemies, generally considered an important factor in regulating populations of T. pityocampa, were low, and did not significantly reduce pest population density. The prompt reaction of the larvae to the rise of temperature in winter and the prolonged diapause of the pupae seem to be the main adaptive characteristics of the pine processionary caterpillar to climate change. These facts confer on the pest a high probability of success in invading forests that may become progressively more suitable as a consequence of climatic change.

TI  - The influence of the jarrah leafminer Perthida glyphopa common (Lepidoptera Incurvariidae) and prescribed burning on the girth increment of jarrah Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Smith
AB  - Girth increment in jarrah trees, E. marginata, both resistant and susceptible to the jarrah leafminer, P. glyphopa, was measured in SW Western Australia at 3 sites between 1971 and 1986 and at another site between 1971 and 1981. The sites were in 2 distinct annual rainfall zones (523-758 and 793-1155 mm in the period 1970-86). Significant annual losses of girth increment were detected in the susceptible trees damaged by the leafminer before and during the time of observation. In trees observed through the development of heavy infestation, significant girth increment losses occurred some 5 years after the damage began. Over the period of observation the mean losses of girth increment in the susceptible trees ranged from 44 to 70%. Rainfall in both current and preceding years had a significant effect on the girth increment in all trees, but varied between sites. At the drier sites both resistant and susceptible trees responded significantly only to the current year's rainfall, while those at the wetter sites were significantly influenced by rainfall of the previous year. In the susceptible trees this effect was overridden by the influence of damage by the leafminer. Girth increment in both resistant and susceptible trees increased for 1 year after 4 out of 5 ground fires (controlled burning) in spring that occurred during the period of observation.

TI  - Control of Cydia pomonella in walnuts by mating disruption
AB  - Experimental trials have been carried out over two years to evaluate the efficacy of the mating disruption technique for the control of C. pomonella in walnut orchards in the Rovigo district (northeast of Italy). Male codling moth populations were monitored within two blocks nearby; traps were hung at two different heights in the tree canopy. A 4.1 ha block was treated with 400 dispensers/ha, using Isagro's dispensers Ecopom in 1996 and Ecopom Combi in 1997, while the second block was split into two plots, insecticide-treated and untreated. Catches of male moths were reduced over 85% in the pheromone-treated block each year. Pheromone treatment was also very effective in reducing injury (77.7% in 1996, 88.2% in 1997). Damage was higher in the pheromone-treated block in the first year (4.5%) compared with the insecticide plot, but in the second year, the best results (2.7%) were obtained using the mating disruption technique. Overwintering populations increased across all blocks from 1996 to 1997.

TI  - Lepidoptera associated with blueberry cultivation in Western Andalusia. / Lepidopteros asociados al cultivo del arndano en Andaluca occidental
AB  - Among studies carried out since blueberry introduction in western Andalusia, Spain, a survey was carried out to identify the Lepidoptera species associated with this crop. Plants of five blueberry southern highbush cultivars were sampled on plots of 1010 m. Fourteen species belonging to 8 Lepidoptera families were collected. Most of them were non-outbreak pests which must have incorporated blueberry into their diets recently. Because of their biological characteristics, frequency, population dynamics and type of damage, the tortricids Cacoecimorpha pronubana and Lobesia botrana, the pyralid Criptobables gnidiella [Cryptoblabes gnidiella] and the noctuids Spodoptera littoralis and Acronicta auricoma are discussed as the Lepidoptera species which may require monitoring and/or some form of control.

TI  - Susceptibility of rice plants to stem borer damage at different growth stages and influence on grain yields
AB  - Effects of stem borer [Scirpophaga incertulas] damage at different growth stages of rice plants on yield components and grain yields were studied by conducting several experiments both under actual stem borer infestation and simulated damage conditions at the experimental farm of the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute at Gazipur, Bangladesh. Rice plants at the early vegetative stages were much more susceptible to stem borers than at the reproductive stages. At a given stem borer population density, rice plants suffered 2-10 times more damage at the vegetative growth stages than at the reproductive stages. Plants fully recovered from about 30% deadheart damage at the vegetative stage by the production of additional tillers, but suffered yield losses because compensatory tillers produced lighter panicles. Therefore, plots with 20% or more deadhearts suffered significant yield losses. A low level of infestation (1 unparasitized yellow stem borer egg mass/m2) at the reproductive stage did not reduce grain yield, but two or more egg masses/m2 caused a yield reduction. At similar stem borer damage levels plants suffered more yield losses when damage occurred at reproductive stages than at the vegetative stages. Plant recovery was more vigorous when damage was done artificially through mechanical means than damage by actual stem borer larvae. Experiments with simulated stem borer damage by mechanical means do not represent actual losses, but rather over-exaggerate plant recovery and compensation and thus underestimate actual losses.

TI  - Reinfestation of Eucalyptus marginata ground coppice by jarrah leafminer after scorch by autumn or spring fires
AB  - Population densities of the jarrah leafminer Perthida glyphopa in adjoining areas of jarrah Eucalyptus marginata forest in southwest Western Australia were monitored before and after autumn and spring fires, and then compared to examine the effect of fire season and intensity. Densities of leafminers were reduced in tree canopies and on ground coppice after autumn fire scorched the host canopies. Densities of larval mines on ground coppice increased by the second spring after an autumn fire. Numbers of mines on leaves returned to levels indistinguishable from pre-fire values by the second autumn after fire. Leafminer populations on ground coppice appeared unaffected by a spring fire. Mechanisms that may account for observed differences between the effects of spring and autumn fires are discussed. Managed fires are not considered a practical tool for control of leafminer populations.

TI  - Correlation between the number of adult male Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.) (Lep., Gelechiidae) catches on pheromone traps and the rate of infestation in fruiting bodies of cotton plants by young larvae in three regions of central Greece
AB  - In order to evaluate the influence of the number of catches in pheromone-baited traps on the percentage of larval infestation, six delta traps equipped with sex attractant were placed in each of three regions in Central Greece (Farkadona, Farsala, Almyros) in cotton fields from 20 June until 30 September 1995. The collection of fruiting bodies took place weekly and the counting of adults in the traps was carried out each day. The population fluctuation in all three regions was similar with their peak during the first weeks of August. In Farkadona the infestation level was low (1% at the first sampling of August) with a maximum of 9% in the last sampling of September. In Farsala and Almyros, the infestation level was already high (10% and above) in early August. There was a significant positive linear correlation between the number of moth catches and the infestation percentage from first- and second-stage larvae on the first (R=0694) and second (R=0.7399) boll-feeding generations.

TI  - Population dynamics and life-cycle of corn borers in South Atlantic European coast
AB  - Sesamia nonagrioides and Ostrinia nubilalis are the main pests of maize in the mediterranean countries. Population fluctuations of both species were studied in northwest Spain through 1990-96. The abundance of both species varied greatly between and within locations. Their attacks were very intense in 1995 and 1996, reaching 100% of damaged plants in two plots, 30-50% in a third one and 7% in a fourth plot. In several plots and years more than one larvae per plant at harvest was found. The captures of adult moths made with pheromone traps indicate the existence of two generations, the first one flying in May and the second one in July-August. The larvae of first generation of both species rarely attack maize, but by September, most plants have been colonized by S. nonagrioides and, to a lesser degree, by O. nubilalis larvae. Larvae of both species overwinter inside the dead plants of maize, that are usually left in the fields after harvesting by most farmers. Given the mild winter temperatures of the South Atlantic coast, most of them survive until the next spring and produce the adults of first generation. Cultural methods (e.g. destruction of plant stems) and the use of resistant maize genotypes could improve the management of maize borers, diminishing economic damage.

TI  - Seasonal abundance and association of light trap catches with field incidence of rice leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee)
AB  - Investigations on seasonal abundance of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis were carried out during the wet season for 8 years (1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1991) at Waraseoni, Madhya Pradesh, India. Moth catches and field incidence started in the first week of August and showed a significant increase in the month of September. The peak period and field incidence of moths were observed in September followed by October. A significant positive association between light trap catches and field incidence reflected the severity pattern of leaffolders in the field. Pest incidence during a period of 8 years showed a regular incidence of leaffolder with considerable damage in the eastern part of Madhya Pradesh.

TI  - Factors affecting the dynamics of pine looper (Bupalus piniarius) numbers in Siberian forests
AB  - The main factors in the population dynamics of the pine looper in Siberian forests are analysed, based on long-term studies which were conducted between 1978 and 1994 in the forest-steppe areas of southern Krasnoyarsk, Altai and Northern Kazakhstan, with the aim of subsequently creating a representative computer model. Population counts were generally conducted in spring during the pupal stage and in summer during larval stages III-IV. Data are presented showing the variability of the main indicators (adult fecundity, pupal weight, mortality rates of larvae from various factors) at different stages of the population cycle. Results revealed that factors regulating pine looper numbers in European forests, such as egg and larval parasites, do not apply significantly in Siberian forests, where factors affecting the pupal stage are of greater relative importance. Mortality rates and the relation between individual causal factors provide a diagnostic tool for determining the stage of the population cycle. It is concluded that meteorological conditions are significant determinants of seasonal and long-term population dynamics.

TI  - Behavioral observations of codling moth, Cydia pomonella, in orchards permeated with synthetic pheromone
AB  - Mating disruption of codling moth, Cydia pomonella, was studied in apple orchards treated with the main pheromone compound codlemone, (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienol, and a blend of codlemone and codlemone acetate, (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienyl acetate, a strong pheromone antagonist. Codlemone alone and the pheromone/antagonist-blend had a similar effect on the behaviour of males emerging into air-permeated orchards. Male flights within tree canopy and upwind orientation along tree rows were strongly enhanced by both formulations, compared to untreated plots. However, the codlemone/codlemone acetate-blend increased the rate of cross-wind and downwind flights within the orchard, compared to codlemone alone. The major difference between these two formulations was that males from nearby, untreated orchards were attracted towards orchards treated with codlemone, but not towards treatments with codlemone/codlemone acetate. Additional tests were done with an equilibrium blend of codlemone and its geometric isomers. Aerial pheromone concentrations in the orchards were recorded by the field electroantennogram technique. Decreasing pheromone concentrations towards the upper part of the tree canopy, together with the stimulation of male flight activity by synthetic pheromone explains failures to control codling moth at high population densities with current dispenser formulations.

TI  - Resistance of sugarcane varieties toward sugarcane moth borer. / Ketahanan relatif varietas-varietas tebu terhadap hama penggerek
AB  - The aim of this research was to study resistance of various sugarcane varieties toward moth borer Tryporyza nivella [Scirpophaga nivella] and Chilo sacchariphagus borer. In this study, levels of resistance of certain varieties to moth borer prior to deployment of a commercial variety in a specific area was observed using a randomised block design with 3 replicates. Observation were performed in 3 periods, i.e. primary cane planting season 1995/96, ratoon I 1996/97 and primary cane planting season 1996/97, using 29 sugarcane varieties. Cane resistance was observed toward Tryporyza nivella and stalk borer. Results showed that out of 29 varieties tested, 21 varieties were resistant, 7 varieties were moderately resistant and 1 was sensitive to bud borer attack. Annually, infestation by bud borer in the standard sensitive variety (Ps 59) was tested. Level of bud borer infestation in average varieties was in the range of 2.19% to 16.56%, whereas in the standard variety it was 16.36%. In one variety, 10% infestation of bud borer during cane cutting was considered as a low rate of infestation. Similarly, those 29 sugarcane varieties were tested for their sensitivity towards stalk borer. Results showed that 9 varieties were resistant while 20 varieties were moderately resistant towards stalk borer. In comparisons of stalk borer infestation with the standard sensitive variety (Ps 59), the level of stalk borer infestation in the tested variety was in the range of 1.09% to 3.84%, whereas in the standard variety it was 3.92%. This level of infestation was lower than that of economic standard (0.5%). These results suggested that high yielding resistant and moderately resistant varieties could be employed intensively. Commercial varieties sensitive to bud borer could be planted in dry land or an area that has not been infested with bud borer. During the dry season, high humidity in sugarcane plantations would moth borer population increases. To conclude, the presence of moth borer infestation did not indicate that that cane variety was sensitive to moth borer infestation.

TI  - Recent outbreak of oak decline in Lower Saxony - causes and prevention. / Aktuelles Eichensterben in Niedersachsen - Ursachen und Gegenmassnahmen
AB  - In NW Germany, several outbreaks of oak (Quercus robur) decline were recorded during the first half of the 20th century. More recent outbreaks occurred in 1985-87 and 1998-97, evidenced by tree ring analysis. The latest outbreak caused 10 to 40% oak mortality in Lower Saxony (stands aged 30 to 150 years old). Oak decline was always preceded by repeated defoliation by insects (Operophtera brumata, Tortrix viridana, Hibernia defoliaria [Erannis defoliaria], Archips sp.). However, insect attack was only followed by oak decline if there were extreme weather conditions (hard late-winter frosts, serious spring frost, and drought, especially on gleyed soils). The occurrence of oak decline in conjunction with these two factors is discussed; the physiological factor most affected is hydraulic conductivity. Field observations indicate that in mixed stands with Picea abies or Fagus sylvatica as understorey species, oak decline is considerably reduced. Silvicultural prescriptions for reducing the susceptibility of oaks to decline symptoms are discussed.

TI  - Development of a pheromone-based monitoring system for the macadamia nut borer, Cryptophlebia ombrodelta (Lower) (Tortricidae Olethreutinae), in Australia
AB  - The pheromone of Cryptophlebia ombrodelta was evaluated for its suitability as a monitoring tool in macadamia orchards in New South Wales and Queensland during October 1996-April 1997. The relationship between the number of males recovered from pheromone traps and oviposition was examined. When data on numbers of eggs recovered was adjusted using an empirical formula to predict when oviposition occurred, a reasonable correlation between trap catch and oviposition was revealed. A sharp rise in weekly pheromone trap catch often either preceded or coincided with a sharp rise in oviposition. It is concluded that the first record of 6 or more moths/8 traps per day indicates the need to begin sampling for eggs. The influence of trap height was also investigated. Significantly more moths were caught in traps placed at 5 m (just below the top of the canopy) than at 2 m above ground level.

TI  - A systems approach to assess crop health and maize yield losses due to pests and diseases in Cameroon
AB  - Three surveys of maize fields were undertaken in 1993 in Cameroon, ranging from low to high altitudes, and from forests in the south with bimodal rainfall (2 cropping seasons) to the northern savanna with monomodal rainfall distribution (1 cropping season). Field conditions, insects and diseases, plant growth and yield variables were assessed in 164 fields. Increased soil fertility (expressed as plant vigour) favoured Bipolaris maydis [Cochliobolus miyabeanus], Physoderma maydis and Busseola fusca. There was a positive relationship between soil organic matter and B. fusca, Eldana saccharina and C. miyabeanus. As organic matter decreased, percentage leaf area lost to pathogens, particularly Puccinia sorghi, increased. There was an inverse relationship between wild grasses around a field and stem borers in the field. Stem diameter, cob fill and weight increased with altitude reflecting the change from early maturing lowland cultivars to very late maturing mid- to high-altitude cultivars. Across ecological zones and surveys, B. fusca accounted for 95% of all the species found on maize, followed by E. saccharina. In the first cropping season, the mean percentage borer infestation was similar in lowland and highland with a mean of 43%. Borer incidence was higher during the second cropping season. In both low and mid-altitude fields, 52-56% of the plants were infested, resulting in a calculated cob weight loss of 9 g/plant. At that time, the average plant loss from dead hearts across zones was 11%. C. miyabeanus, Puccinia polysora and Physoderma maydis predominated in the lowlands, and Exserohilum turcicum [Setosphaeria turcica], P. sorghi and Phaeosphaeria maydis occurred mainly in mid- to high-altitudes. Maize streak monogeminivirus, stem diseases, B. maydis, Rhizoctonia (R. solani) sheath blight and P. sorghi consistently had significant negative impacts on cob weight. The aetiology of stem lesions was not determined, but they significantly affected cob weight in the humid lowlands. Average reduction in cob weight from foliar and stem diseases in the different ecological zones and seasons ranged between 10 and 12 g/plant.

TI  - Relative abundance of some lepidopterous moths attracted to a light-trap at Al-Arish city, North Sinai during two successive years
AB  - A light trap was used to study the relative abundance of lepidopterous moths at Al-Arish City, Egypt, from October 1994 to September 1996. The total annual catches were 35 532 and 11 484 moths. They belonged to 62 species of 51 genera of 15 families. The greatest numbers were trapped during summer (July-September) with peaks in August 1995 (5432 moths) and September 1996 (1950 moths). Noctuidae were the most abundant (28 species), constituting 71.8 and 66.2% of total annual catches (25 500 and 7600 moths). The most abundant of all species was Spodoptera littoralis (14.6 and 15.4% of the total noctuid catches) with peaks during June 1995 and May 1996. Sphingidae constituted 8.3 and 6.8% of total catches. Moths of other families were less abundant and less active.

TI  - An evaluation of the pest status and research conducted on phytophagous Lepidoptera on cultivated plants in South Africa
AB  - A literature survey was conducted on Lepidoptera that damage cultivated plants in South Africa, to estimate the present status of local lepidopteran pests and to highlight research priorities. A database was compiled from papers published between 1980 and 1994. Moran's formula for determining pest status was modified to provide a more objective assessment of the relative importance of the pest species. Helicoverpa armigera ranked as the most important lepidopteran pest in South Africa. The pest status of Eldana saccharina, Tortrix capensana and Chilo partellus ranked higher than in Moran's assessment, whereas the pest status of Plutella xylostella ranked substantially lower. Following global trends, the Noctuidae were found to be the most important lepidopteran pests in South Africa, and cosmopolitan and African lepidopteran pests were of greater importance than endemic species. Borers and cutworms were more important than defoliators and miners. Articles relating to extension services exceeded research papers, and 28% of research publications appeared in international journals. The output was greatest on citrus and cereal crops, and the Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Crops published the most articles on lepidopteran pests during the period reviewed. A substantial amount of information on the control of lepidopteran pests in South Africa has been published, whereas only a few articles on yield loss, economic loss or pest distribution have appeared. Studies of yield loss and economic loss will improve the efficiency of pest management practices and will also facilitate the calculation of true pest status, and are identified as research priorities. The description and monitoring of pest distribution are also important in anticipating and mitigating the potential negative impact of climate change on agroecosystems.

TI  - Tracing the epicentres of teak defoliator outbreaks in Kerala (Report of the project KFRI 175/93 sponsored by the Kerala Forest Department Development Fund, February 1993-December 1994)
AB  - A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that teak [Tectona grandis] defoliator (Hyblaea puera) outbreaks begin in small epicentres and spread progressively to extensive areas as a result of population build up in these epicentres. To collect relevant data, about 10 000 ha each of teak plantations in Nilambur and Konni were kept under observation during the outbreak period in 1993, and all outbreaks mapped. Interpretation of the spatial and temporal sequence of outbreaks gave the following conclusions. In large teak plantation areas, H. puera outbreaks begin in comparatively small epicentres which may be 0.6-12 ha in area. These epicentres are not constant over the years and do not represent highly favourable local environments. Instead, they are sites where a group of immigrating moths, or moths locally present but concentrated by as yet unknown phenomena, assemble and lay eggs. Although many of the extensive outbreaks which occurred subsequently could be attributed to the pest population build up in these epicentres, all the outbreaks could not be attributed to locally built up populations - immigration of moths from outside the Nilambur area was necessary to explain these. It appears that many of the large-scale outbreaks can be prevented by controlling the small epicentre populations. An experimental study involving control of epicentre populations is recommended to examine the effectiveness of this approach to teak defoliator management. The study also revealed that teak plantations in all areas are not equally prone to defoliator attack - incidence of outbreaks appears to be strongly correlated with the orographic (mountain) features of the planted area, but more detailed studies are needed to elucidate the relationship.

TI  - Seasonal and annual change of a folivorous insect guild in the Siebold's beech forests associated with outbreaks of the beech caterpillar, Quadricalcarifera punctatella (Motschulsky) (Lep., Notodontidae)
AB  - Seasonal and annual changes of folivorous insects of beech (Fagus crenata) associated with outbreaks of the notodontid Quadricalcarifera punctatella were investigated in northern Japan from 1988 to 1992. Lepidopterous larvae sampled from branches and fallen frass were used for the analysis. Sixty-nine species were found over a 5-year period. Most species in the families Tortricidae. Geometridae and Noctuidae infested early in the year, while Notodontidae fed later in the year. Although the number of species decreased, the size of those infesting became greater in later seasons. There were 3 peaks in seasonal changes in falling frass the first was in June and was constant over years and locations; the second, caused mainly by Q. punctatella in August, varied greatly among years; and the third peak was sometimes ambiguous. Total frass was strongly influenced by Q. punctatella density. The density of this species changed with a magnitude of 10 000, but the weight of frass produced by the other folivorous insects was estimated to fluctuate by 10 times at most. The frass of other insects decreased in the year following conspicuous defoliation by Q. punctatella. The results indicate that delayed induced response of F. crenata caused by Q. punctatella influenced not only the species itself but also other folivorous insects. Q. punctatella was the main factor determining the biomass of folivorous insects in the beech forests in northern Japan during the period studied.

TI  - Damage of pine cones by insects and ecology of Gravitarmata margarotana and Dioryctria abietella in Kangwon-do
AB  - In a study done in 1997 insect species identified emerging from cones of Pinus densiflora, Pinus rigida and Pinus koraiensis in the Chunchon region of the Korea Republic were Gravitarmata margarotana, Petrova cristata, Dioryctria abietella, Pseudacrobasis nankingella, Blastobasis sp. and D. sylvestrella. Among these cone insects, Pseudacrobasis nankingella and Blastobasis sp. were newly recorded in Kangwon Province. G. margarotana was the most frequently occurring species in Pinus densiflora and Pinus rigida, and Petrova cristata was the most frequently occurring species in Pinus koraiensis. Data are presented on seasonal development in cone size by species, and seasonal changes in percentage damage and larval infestation of cones. By August, the damage rate of cones was 91.7% in Pinus densiflora, 90.0% in Pinus rigida, and 100% in Pinus koraiensis. The average number of living larvae in Pinus densiflora and Pinus rigida cones was 2.9 and 9.0, respectively. Numbers peaked in May. More detailed studies were done on 2 of the pest species - G. margarotana and D. abietella, for which the life cycles are shown diagrammatically. The emergence period of G. margarotana was from mid-April to late May and peaked in late April, and that of D. abietella was from late May to late August and peaked in early June.

TI  - The influence of temperature on egg mortality in the budmoth Zeiraphera diniana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), and its role in determining the regional abundance of an important forest pest
AB  - The range of the tortricid Zeiraphera diniana and the regions where high population densities are infrequent and unpredictable are thought to be determined by high temperatures during egg pre-diapause. Exposure of eggs to incubation temperatures known to be optimum for Z. diniana elsewhere resulted in a pre-diapause mortality of 13%, which corresponded to known rates of egg mortality in forests in the UK. Evidence suggested that high temperature and its duration were both important determinants of pre-diapause egg mortality which, if experienced in forest conditions, may prevent populations from reaching outbreak levels. Historical records of outbreaks were associated with lower than average August temperature. However, high temperatures on their own were unlikely to determine the range of the insect in the UK, since a high proportion of eggs survived extremes (&gt;70% of eggs from the UK survived a 24-h exposure to 30C). Variations in egg mortality among families of moths suggested a genetic basis for differences in thermal tolerance. Furthermore, there may be selection for thermally-tolerant eggs in UK forest environments, and this could be connected with other forms of genetic differentiation in populations of Z. diniana.

TI  - A model for forecasting the emergence of tortrix moth Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidopterae Tortricidae). / Model prognoziranja pojave jabukinog smotavca Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - Both the models connected with forecasting the emergence and simulation flight models of Cydia pomonella are based on the primary characteristics of pest biology and environmental conditions (particularly on air temperature) suitable for pest development. They are based on flight phenology and effective temperature sums necessary for development of certain stages of growth and characteristic moments during its flight. Investigations were carried out during 1985-94 at Ljubic, near aak. Flight phenology was monitored by pheromone traps. The effective temperature sums for the most important phenological moments (flight onset, embryonic development, flight maxima for both generations, total duration of a flight) were represented by the number of degree-days. Over the 10 years of the investigation, the onset of moth flight started from 28 April to 3 May, most frequently (over 6 years) in the first half of May. The earliest end of flight occurred on 23 August 1990, while the latest one was on 8 September 1987. Over all the years of the study, the number of degree-days from 1 January to the onset of moth flight ranged from 12 to 53, averaging 27.5. The temperature conditions necessary for the first emergence of the moth were realized on average after the 4th day, namely, the first moths were caught in traps after the 4th day at a minimal temperature of &gt;10C. The maximal flights of the first moth generation were prolonged during May and June. As regard to the maximal flights of the first generation recorded in May (over 6 years), the average degree-days amounted to 47, whereas 169 degree-days were necessary for maximal flights in June. The total duration of the flight during crop growth amounted on average to 794 degree-days. According to the calculation connected with the period of copulation, oviposition and embryonic development, 5 to 6 days in accordance with the required temperature conditions were needed in order to induce first larval hatching. As far as this period was concerned, 45.5 degree-days were needed from the onset of flight. Over 7 years of the investigation, the onset of hatching occurred after the maximum flight of the first generation, ranging from 2 to 16 days.

TI  - Characteristics of the occurrence of butterflies and pupae of the pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea Schiff.) in the inter-gradation period in pine stands in forest districts of Potrzebowice and Tuczno. / Charakterystyka wytepowania motyli i poczwarek strzygoni choinwki (Panolis flammea Schiff.) w okresie miedzygradacyjnym w drzewostanach sosnowych w Nadl. Potrzebowice i Tuczno
AB  - Observations on the occurrence of butterflies (adults) and pupae of the pine beauty moth were carried out over several years (1988-95) in the inter-gradation period [the period between mass outbreaks] in 2 sample pine [Pinus sylvestris] stands each of several hundred hectares in coniferous forest sites differing in age, stand density and stand quality in Potrzebowice and Tuczno, Poland. In each stand selected trees were used for trapping adults in spring, by means of pheromone traps containing the preparation Pandor, hung 2 m above ground. Under the same trees estimations were made on the pupal density in the autumn. No relationships were found between the number of adults caught, pupal density and stand characteristics (such as site factors, stand density, and stand quality class). Neither were relationships found between quantitative occurrence of the pine beauty moth and characteristics of individual trees (such as age, dbh (diameter at breast height), height, crown length, crown compactness, and branching). There were, however, areas of stands in both study areas, where numbers of adults and pupae increased, although the regions in which the increases occurred were not the same for the 2 stages. However, for individual trees, there was a relationship between the average density of pupae during the whole observation period, and the numbers of adults caught in traps.

TI  - The flight dynamics of the oriental fruit moth Grapholitha molesta Busck. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) on sticky pheromone traps
AB  - Males of Grapholitha molesta [Grapholita molesta] were monitored in orchards in Ukraine during May-October 1992-93 using sticky traps baited with synthetic sex pheromone. Four peaks of occurrence were recorded, corresponding to the overwintered and 3 summer generations. The largest peak was observed in late August-early September. Ten other species of tortricids were also caught in the traps, G. funebrana [Cydia funebrana] being the most abundant of these.

TI  - Population dynamics of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) in undisturbed apple orchards of eastern Switzerland. / Populationsschwankungen des Apfelwicklers Cydia pomonella (L.) in ungestrten Apfelbestnden der Ostschweiz
AB  - Populations of Cydia pomonella were studied over several years on apples in eastern Switzerland in a stand of standard trees not treated with pesticides for years (Grabs); in 3 small commercial orchards (0.5-1.3 ha) with apple bushes, where C. pomonella control (insecticides or sterile insect release) was interrupted (Grabs, Uetwilen, Marschlins). On standard trees the pest population remained at a rather balanced level of 8000-25 000 larvae/ha (fruit attack 7-24%) during 1968-76. In the 3 commercial orchards the initial pest population was very low (260-430 larvae/ha, 0.5-1% fruit attack) due to regular insecticide applications. After interruption of control measures (insecticides or SIT) the population rose in 1-2 years to a higher level, different for each orchard (4000-10 000 larvae/ha, 4-7% fruit attack). The increase occurred at the same speed in the non-isolated orchard at Grabs and in the well isolated orchards at Uetwilen and Marschlins. In all three orchards immigration seemed to be of some importance. In Grabs the pest population on standard trees (absolute value and percentage fruit attack) was clearly higher than in the adjacent commercial orchard. Old standard trees have more and better shelters for overwintering larvae than apple bushes. They are also visually more attractive for flying moths. Population changes from one year to the other can largely be explained by the weather character of the summer, decisive for oviposition of C. pomonella in temperate climate. Due to the lack of basic data the importance of other factors is difficult to assess.

AB  - Field studies were carried out during 1995-96 in Germany in [Pinus] forest stands infested by pine moth (Dendrolimus pini). In 1995, stands showed a good regeneration capacity even after major needle losses (80-90%). Favourable weather conditions and absence of stem breeding forest insects were the main reasons for good growth. The highest volumes of damaged wood (10.9-16.5% of basal areas) were registered in stands with severe insect attacks. The corresponding number of dead trees, according to a computer forecast, was 220-240 trees/ha. The amount of damaged wood represented many times the normal decline (as estimated by yield tables). Differences were present in percentages of damaged wood between age classes and survey years.

TI  - Pest status and seasonal incidence of stem borer complex of rice in semi deep water situation at Bhubaneswar
AB  - Field studies were conducted in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India, during 1992-93, to study the composition of different borer species in semi-deep water conditions, population fluctuations and off-season behaviour. The yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) produced two broods, with the first peaking during the last week of September and the second peaking during the second week of November which coincided with the dough stage of rice. Egg masses were more abundant in the second brood (1.33 m-2) than the first (1.00 m-2). S. incertulas was the dominant species until the first week of October when the stripe stem borer (Chilo suppressalis) and pink stem borer (Sesamia inferens) contributed to the total larval population, which was greatest during the second week of December (23.07%) and third week of December (35.01%), respectively. Examination of stubble on 23 and 27 January 1993 showed that more larvae and pupae were found on the first day (83.25%) than on the second (76.36%).

TI  - Field validation of a developmental model for Cydia funebrana (Treitschke) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in northern Italy
AB  - Initial results from the validation of a temperature-driven model for Cydia funebrana (plum fruit moth) in northern Italy are presented using data obtained in 1995 and 1996 in Emilia-Romagna. Having defined biological parameters in the laboratory, catches of males in pheromone traps and oviposition activity were monitored in orchards of mid- and late-ripening plum varieties. The model was then run using temperature data from each farm. When the oviposition activity forecast by the model was compared to that actually observed in three orchards, good correlations between actual and forecast oviposition were obtained, particularly where cumulative oviposition was between 30 and 80%. Actual oviposition generally occurred over a longer time period than predicted. It is proposed that in the near future, after further validation, the model will predict oviposition activity as a cumulative percentage and as a result technicians will be able to assess the risk of C. funebrana damage by sampling actual oviposition on just a single occasion.

TI  - Calculating temperature dependence over long time periods a comparison and study of methods
AB  - Nonlinear temperature dependence plays a major role in a large variety of ecological models. For the sake of simplicity and efficiency, the temperature dependence functions in many models are calculated for monthly or yearly time intervals, using temperature means or interpolations between means as input. As a consequence, information about the variability of the temperature input data is lost, which leads to a bias in the temperature dependence function and to errors in the model results. This common approach for calculating temperature dependence on a larger time scale (temporal aggregation) was tested against a range of 7 new aggregation methods, all with the common principle of estimating the expected value of the temperature dependence over the aggregation period, but also taking into account the information about the temperature variability contained in the available input by using the mean or standard deviation of temperature variables in different temporal resolutions. In the tests carried out temperature dependence functions were used from four different ecological fields - soil respiration, apple tree bud rest break, forest tree net photosynthesis (of Pinus cembra, Picea abies, Abies alba, Larix decidua, Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica), and the development of the larval and pupal stages of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella). Hourly temperature data sets from various climatically differing sites were used as input. The precision of the tested methods increased with the resolution of the input data, although computing time increased. The mean errors ranged from less than 1% to about 8% for the aggregation to 1 month and from about 1% to over 30% for the aggregation to 10 years. The most precise and efficient method is the explicit calculation of the expected value for the dependence function, which is based on the mean and standard deviation of hourly temperatures. The least precise but most efficient method is the common application of the dependence function to mean values. The quality of these methods is mainly determined by the quality of the approximation of the temperature variability. Condensing highly resolved input data into means is only appropriate if either the dependence functions are linear in the observed temperature range, or low precision but very high computing efficiency is required. Given a certain requirement on precision or computing efficiency, it is now possible to indicate for a number of input data resolutions the appropriate method for calculating temperature dependence over long time periods.

TI  - Monitoring field populations with pheromone trap and seasonal trend of adult body size of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera Yponomeutidae), in Central Thailand
AB  - Three traps baited with a sex pheromone lure were placed in a field with Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra [B. alboglabra]) and Chinese white cabbage (B. pekinensis) located in Pathum Thani, in the suburbs of Bangkok City in Central Thailand, to estimate the seasonal trend in population density of Plutella xylostella. Large numbers of moths were captured all the year round regardless of the distinctive differences in climatic conditions. A sharp decline in population coincided with harvest of the vegetables in the furrows and a lag to recover the population density was detected for several weeks after harvest, indicating a low flight activity of the moths in the near proximity and/or narrow range of action of the pheromone lure. The insects maintained a high population level all the year round, and there were no clear differences in the number of the moths captured by traps between seasons. The body size of the male moths found in Thailand was small and constant throughout the year, as the temperature is always hot with negligible seasonal changes. The size coincided with that of the moths found only in mid-summer in Japan.

TI  - Population dynamics of rice leaffolders and yield loss potential in Bangladesh
AB  - Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, Marasmia patnalis, M. exigua and Brachmia arotraea [Helcystogramma arotraea], fold rice leaves and feed on the green tissue in Bangladesh. H. arotraea was recorded for the first time as a rice leaffolder (RLF) in that country. The relative abundance of the RLF complex varied with the rice seasons. In six successive seasons in Gazipur, larval population density (0-2.89/m) and leaf damage (0-3.34%) were very low. Concurrent surveys in other selected areas also revealed very low incidence of RLF in the country except for a localized outbreak occurring in the 1994 transplant Aman season (monsoon rice) in Gazipur. Preliminary crop loss assessment indicated that these outbreaks may have low damage potential. RLF larvae are attacked by about 15 parasitoid species and average parasitism in 13 crop seasons was 34.6% (6-45%), which seemed to play an important role in population suppression. Thus it appeared that RLF may be considered as a sporadic pest in Bangladesh and damage potential of localized outbreaks needs to be critically examined.

TI  - Argyresthia moths (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae, Argyresthiinae) on Norway spruce in the West Carpathians. / ber die Fichten-Silbermotten (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae, Argyresthiinae) in den Westkarpaten
AB  - Three species of the genus Argyresthia (A. bergiella [A. illuminatella], A. amiantella and A. glabratella) were studied in Norway spruce forests at an elevation of 380-1550 m in the West Carpathian Mountains (central and western Slovakia). These species have distinct external pupal characteristics and feed marks. They occur together, being more abundant in the middle and upper canopy, and prefer forests at or above 1,000 m, often at the timber line. Their dependence on parent rock was not found. Abundance of these species differed greatly from year to year and any changes in abundance were mostly synchronised at various sites within the same mountain area. A. amiantella was the most abundant species. There is an indication that the outbreaks of Argyresthia moths on Norway spruce [Picea abies] might be short-term.

TI  - Population densities and diversity of Noctuidae (Lepidoptera) along an air pollution gradient on the Kola Peninsula, Russia
AB  - Noctuidae were monitored by means of bait traps from 1991-93 in the area polluted by the Severonikel smelter on the Kola Peninsula, Russia. The total catch was 869 specimens belonging to 21 species. The catches peaked in sites representing the earlier stages of forest decline, being about 2 times as large as in the unpolluted area. The noctuid moths were heterogeneous in their response to pollution impact, although neither species richness nor diversity of Noctuidae were affected by pollution.

TI  - Studies on the population abundance of sugarcane top borer, Scirpophaga excerptalis Walker
AB  - Light traps were used to monitor the population of adults of the sugarcane pest Scirpophaga excerptalis from January 1992 to December 1994 at Navasari, Gujarat, India, at latitude 20.57 N and longitude 72.54 E. S. excerptalis were trapped throughout the study period except June 1992, second fortnight of September 1992, first fortnight of October 1992, second fortnight of July 1993 and second fortnight of December 1994. During 1992-93, the major activity of adults was observed during January to March and November-December with peak population level in the second fortnight of February 1992 and first fortnight of March 1993. During 1994, the pest activity was widespread over January-June, peaking in the second fortnight of May.

TI  - Studies on population dynamics of cashew leaf folders
AB  - Field studies were conducted in cashew plantations in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh, India, from June 1986 to May 1989 to determine the population dynamics of Hypatima haligramma, Dudua aprobola and Caloptilia tiselaea. Insects were observed from the 2nd 2 weeks of August to 1st 2 weeks of March. However, a prolonged occurrence was observed only during 1988-89 with the highest population (47.8 insects per 25 laterals) occurring during the 1st 2 weeks of November causing maximum leaf damage (16.8%). The maximum temperature, minimum temperature, RH and rainfall explained 51.5% of the total variation in the number of insects. Maximum temperature and RH had a significant negative effect while minimum temperature had a significant positive effect on population fluctuations. Increased populations and damage were observed on plants older than 8-11 years.

TI  - Key factor analysis of population data for Perthida glyphopa Common (Lepidoptera Incurvariidae)
AB  - Life tables for Perthida glyphopa were constructed from data collected between 1968 and 1985 at 10 sites in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in the south-west of Western Australia, where the leafminer occurred at high population densities. Each table consisted of 8 intervals in the leafminer life cycle, including the apparent fecundity of females, eggs, small larvae, large larvae, larval cells, aestivating larvae in the soil, adults and female adults. The key factors were the apparent realised fecundity of females, reacting to the availability of young leaves for oviposition at nine sites of high population density, and mortality of aestivating larvae in the soil at another site of low population density. Natural enemies influenced the population trend only to a minor degree. Direct density dependent mortality was detected at one site of high population density, operating on small larvae and inverse density dependent mortality on eggs. A further instance of inverse density dependent mortality of large larvae in leaves was caused by natural enemies at another site.

TI  - Synchronization of hatching date with budburst of individual host trees (Quercus robur) in the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and its fitness consequences
AB  - Due to varying selection pressures among host individuals, herbivorous insects may show local adaptation at the individual level. In Operophtera brumata, synchrony of egg hatching and host tree (Quercus robur) budburst may have important fitness consequences and, therefore, may result in a local adaptation to the hosts phenology. However, relatively high gene flow levels may disrupt such a fine-scale adaptation. In field studies conducted in Belgium, hatching dates of egg clutches laid by females of O. brumata collected during copulation, and variation in budburst dates (1991, 1994 and 1995) of trees on which these couples were collected were determined. Budburst date showed substantial variation within years and areas, as the first and last tree to start leafing were separated by up to 26 days. Relative budburst dates of individual trees were constant between years. Average hatching dates differed significantly among clutches and varied over 30 days, a range comparable to that of budburst. Hatching dates were positively associated with budburst of the respective trees indicating individual synchrony, which may be mediated by 2 mechanisms. Firstly, early active adults are captured more frequently on early trees and late adults on late trees. As adult activity period is positively correlated with date of egg hatch, early clutches tend to be laid on earlier trees while late clutches will be laid more frequently on late trees. Secondly, a presumed active choice mechanism may additionally increase individual host synchronization. The data support that synchronization of larval hatching with host budburst is adaptive as it increases adult size and thus expected fitness.

TI  - Prediction of field occurrence of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) pheromone traps and degree-day model
AB  - Pheromone traps for monitoring the flight of the noctuid Mamestra brassicae were tested in commercial cabbage and cauliflower fields in different localities in south-eastern Norway during 1989-91. Trap catches were very low in all localities and years, and could not be recommended for practical monitoring. A degree-day model for the prediction of occurrence of adults, eggs and small larvae in the field was developed and validated. Agreement between predicted and observed occurrence was good. An automatic voice board response system for prognosis and advice for growers was developed and implemented. Growers are given information on the present status of M. brassicae in the field, a prognosis for development for the nearest days, when to record eggs for assessment of the need for control, and favourable spraying time. Advice on insecticide use is also given.

TI  - Analysis and interpretation of long term light trap data for Helicoverpa punctigera (Lepidoptera\Noctuidae) in Australia population changes and forecasting pest pressure
AB  - Using regression analysis, the early season dynamics of Helicoverpa punctigera were determined from long series of light trap catches (10-19 years) from 3 sites in Australia (Narrabri and Trangie in New South Wales, and Turretfield in South Australia). The size of the 2nd spring generation (G2, which caused major pest problems in the summer cropping regions) was strongly related to the size of the 1st spring generation (G1). In most cases, rainfall in early winter had a positive influence on the size of G2, whereas rainfall in spring had a negative effect. Regressions were found to account for 49-93% of the annual variation in G2, depending on the site. The use of light trap catches and weather data to forecast pest levels from a few months to a few weeks in advance is discussed, along with the improved understanding of early season H. punctigera population dynamics.

TI  - Integration of the E.V.A. model. To optimise the control periods against Eudemis. / Intgration du modle E.V.A. Pour optimiser les priodes de lutte contre l'Eudmis
AB  - A model was developed for simulating the development of Lobesia botrana on grapes in France. It was shown to be effective in vineyards in the south-west, south-east, Burgundy and Champagne regions. By taking weather data for previous years into account, the model is able to play a role in forecasting the tortricid. By studying the characteristics of insecticidal treatments, date ranges could be fixed in which the theoretical efficacy of the treatment was at an optimal level. A plan is presented for integrating the model into a warning system against the tortricid.

TI  - Seasonal occurrence of the fungus Hirsutella nodulosa Petch and granulosis virus of sugarcane internode borer Chilo sacchariphagus indicus (Kapur)
AB  - Seasonal occurrence of the fungus Hirsutella nodulosa and granulosis virus (GV) of sugarcane internode borer Chilo sacchariphagus indicus was monitored for two years at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. H. nodulosa was active almost throughout the year except during the summer months (April-June). The monthly infection rates varied from 0.0 to 11.0% in both 1993 and 1994, the peak activity being in September. GV was prevalent throughout the year in both study years with higher activity during summer. The levels of infection were 1.0-15.5 and 4.5-17.5% in 1993 and 1994, resp. H. nodulosa activity was negatively correlated with minimum temperature and positively correlated with rainfall in different years. Forenoon RH showed a delayed positive effect on the activity of fungus. Activity of GV was not significantly related to any of the weather parameters. In selected sugar factory areas in the State, the rates of H. nodulosa infection were lower and the levels of GV infection were higher than those at Coimbatore during harvest period. GV and H. nodulosa constitute a potential combination for the control of internode borer.

TI  - Fungal biodiversity on maize kernels in an insecticide evaluation trial
AB  - The European corn borer (ECB) Ostrinia nubilalis and Fusarium ear rot Fusarium spp. pose a continuous threat to maize production worldwide. There are several reports indicating that ECB damage to maize ears promotes Fusarium ear rot infection. The aim of this study was to monitor the influence of different insecticide treatments (a.i. chlorantraniliprole, indoxacarb, and chlorantraniliprole+lambda-cyhalothrin) on the ECB and fungal diversity on maize kernels in the field in a four-year trial (2013-2016). A total of 16 different fungal genera were isolated from maize kernels, and Fusarium species were confirmed to be the dominant pathogens, present in all treatments, throughout the four years of experiments. The incidence of Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. was established to be low. Apart from Fusarium species, the most frequent genera were Aspergillus spp., Mortierella spp., Mucor spp., Penicillium spp., Acremonium spp. and Rhizopus spp. Treatments with chlorantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole+lambda-cyhalothrin showed higher efficacy, though not statistically significant, compared to indoxacarb, in reducing the number of ECB larvae and damage they cause. However, no direct effect on the number of isolated fungal genera has been observed in any of the three insecticide treatments.

TI  - Monitoring of bio-fix and status of overwintering population of codling moth Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) by pheromone baited traps in Kargil, Ladakh
AB  - The development of an effective codling moth management strategy requires detailed information on the pest's population density and phenology. Management of codling moth is difficult because it is a mobile pest, generally occurs at low densities and is a direct internal feeder of pome fruits and walnuts. Thus, management decisions based on sampling information requires timely and accurate assessment of its population status. The use of pheromone traps has elevated codling moth monitoring and management to even higher levels of expertise. Pheromone baited traps were used to detect the first emergence and overwintering population status of codling moth in different regions of Kargil district during 2009 and 2010. The results revealed that the first emergence started in May which coincided with the petal fall stage of the fruit crop. Peaks and valleys in the population trend coincided with temperature fluctuations between sampling periods. As temperature increased from May onwards in this region, counts of male moths captured in the traps increased and remained high through the summer and were low in early spring and late summer. Pheromone based monitoring proved to be a sensitive method of forecasting/predicting population status and provided more effective information for making pest management decisions compared with the currently used visual methods of population detection and estimation.

TI  - Population development and the possibilities of using mating disruption technique for control of Anarsia lineatella Zeller (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) in Canakkale province. / Canakkale ilinde Anarsia lineatella Zeller (LepidopteraGelechiidae)'nn poplasyon gelismesi ve mcadelesinde ciftlesmeyi engelleme tekniginin kullanm olanagnn arastrlmas
AB  - In this study, the possibilities of using mating disruption technique and the population development of peach pest, Anarsia lineatella Zeller (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) has been investigated in the years 2015-2016 in Canakkale province. For this purpose, two orchards were selected with an area of 1 (No2) and 2 (No1) hectares located in Yapldak village near to city centre belonging to the native producer. In 2015 and 2016, the pheromone traps of A. lineatella were placed into both gardens in 16th of March, and the captured adults into the traps have been counted twice in a week. In 2016, after the adults were caught in the traps, on the 20th of April, to test mating disruption (MD) of A. lineatella in the orchard (No1) of 2 ha, 3 and 2 dispensers (134 mg (67.6%) E,5 Decenly acetate + (2.9%) E,5 Decanol) were hung per tree in the edge rows and other trees, respectively. In 0.2 ha of the treated orchard was tested only MD, in the rest of the orchard was applied MD+ insecticides to pest control. In the reference orchard (No2) of one ha insecticides treatments were applied for controlling the pest. Efficacy on the MD was evaluated to compare the fruit injury level among 1000 fruit at the time of harvest and the captured adults onto the traps in the application parcel. In the results, in 2015, during the season, the total number of adults captured onto the traps of 1st and 2nd orchards was 159 and 162, respectively, while the population fluctuation in both orchards was found similar. The first adult was captured onto the traps in the 16th of April, and four different population peaks were observed in the 18th of May, 10th of June, 15th of July and 22nd of August. In 2016, the population density of adults was low as compared to the population observed in 2015. A total of 32 adults have been captured onto the traps found in the orchard (No2) that was without of the application of MD and 2 peaks were observed in the 19th of May and the 20th of July. In case of the parcels with MD application were counted only 6 adults onto pheromone traps. The infested fruit rates were 2.2, 2.0 and 3.6% in MD, insecticides+MD and insecticides, respectively.

TI  - Zone and rate of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) expansion in Bulgaria
AB  - Data records of Forest Protection Station-Plovdiv were used to study the zone and rate of expansion of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) in Central Bulgaria. In 1995, the first pest outbreaks were registered at the territory of two State Forest Enterprises - Chirpan and Sahrane (now named Mazalat). The spreading of T. pityocampa has increasing gradually-three gradation periods were recorded, the last one stated in 2015 and is ongoing, affecting small areas all over the Regional Forest Directorate Stara Zagora. In this area, the pest has spreading predominantly eastward. New infested forest stands occurred far away from the reported ones but they were rare and appeared usually in gradation years. The species settled new range quite slowly and its attacks are still concentrated near the initial outbreaks. In order to prevent T. pityocampa to affect the whole territory of the Directorate it is obviously necessary to control its initial outbreaks. Because of its pupal diapause, the attacked stands should be treated for several consecutive years, even at low population density.

TI  - Control of codling moth Cydia pomonella L. by using CIDETRAK CUDA COMBOTM WIESOTM dispensers in Bulgaria
AB  - Organic fruit production is one of the most attractive directions for Bulgarian farmers. However, it meets serious difficulties - due to a long list of pests occurring in the orchards compared to the short list of plant protection products permitted for use in this system. The codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella L., causes heavy damage in Bulgarian apple orchards. In spite of numerous chemical treatments, these orchards show increasing flight densities of CM moths, growing populations of hibernating larvae, and rising fruit damage rates. Thus, the control of CM by conventional spraying programmes have become ineffective, apparently due to the development of resistance to insecticides. The trials were carried out during the years 2016-2017 in North East of Bulgaria The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of mating disruption (MD) for control of codling moth, in apple orchards comparing CIDETRAK CMDA COMBOTM MESOTM dispensers at high and low rates of 80 and 20 dispensers per ha. These products were developed and are manufactured by Trece Inc., USA. Fruit damage in the trial plot was compared with that in the reference orchard, located in the vicinity, which was treated with conventional pesticides. Damage in the trial (MD) plot increased slowly with time. And even in late cultivars, fruit damage by CM in the MD plot was below the economic threshold-from 0.5 to 1.5%. Mating disruption is an option that may be effective in controlling codling moth, provided that an orchard has a proper size, shape, isolation and low or moderate population density. The present results confirm that mating disruption, using CIDETRAK CMDA COMBOTM MESOTM dispensers against codling moth, can provide more effective control compared to insecticide treatments alone. The usage of CIDETRAK CMDA COMBOTM MESOTM dispensers at reduced rates of 80 and 20 dispensers per ha shows that the number of dispensers used does not affect the effectiveness of mating disruption. The reduced rate of dispensers used will help growers to decrease labor in the field. Applications of these dispensers can provide effective control of codling moth, with better results than the conventional protection programmes employed in Bulgaria.

TI  - Influence of weather factors on population dynamics of gram pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hub.) in chickpea ecosystem
AB  - The influence of weather parameters on population dynamics of gram pod borer in chickpea ecosystem was studied at Crop Research Center of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology, Meerut during two Rabi seasons i.e. 2014-15 and 2015-16 in randomized block design with three replications. It was observed that incidence and population dynamics of this pest was much dependent on the prevailing weather parameters during crop season. The population of H. armigera was recorded during entire crop season from 1st and 52nd standard meteorological weeks (0.46 and 0.40 larvae/m row) to 14th standard week (1.40 and 1.06 larvae/m row) during 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively. The highest mean larval population of H. armigera (10.13 and 8.26 larva/m row) was observed in 11th and 12th standard week during 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively. During this period the mean atmospheric temperature and relative humidity were 20.10 and 21.24 (oC) and 70.64 and 80.72 percent, respectively. Population dynamics of H. armigera was significantly positive correlated to temperature (r=0.692 and r=0.501) and rainfall (0.202 and 0.680) while negative with relative humidity (r=-0.186 and r=-0.173) during both consecutive years.

TI  - The effect of the recommended protection program based on the dynamic of populations flight of apple moth (Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus, 1758)) in the Continental and Mediterranean part of the Republic of Croatia in 2018. / Uiimak preporuenog programa zatite s obzirom na dinamiku leta populacije jabunog savijaa (Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus, 1758)) u Kontinentalnom i Mediteranskom dijelu Repubuke Hrvatske u 2018. godini
AB  - Apple moth (Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus, 1758)) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) is the most important apple pest in all apple growing areas, including the Republic of Croatia. It regularly causes economically significant damages to the fruits. It has two generations per year, and when the conditions are completed even third generation appears. For effective control, it requires a greater number of chemical treatments if other protection methods are not used (e.g. confusion method). In recent years there is a noticeable damage increase in the Mediterranean part of Croatia relative to the Continental part. The simplest and most effective method for monitoring moth flight is by using pheromone traps. Based on captures, it is possible to prepare protection programs and enforce fruit protection using a biofix model. The capture of the first moth (butterfly) as a method of synchronization of the model and physiology of field populations is the basis of biofix model. The purpose of the research was to determine the efficacy of the recommended protection program by combining plant protection products in two climatic regions of the Republic of Croatia, containing active substances in the order of phenoxycarb, chlorantraniliprol+abamectin, emamectin benzoate. During 2018 monitoring of the population dynamics and damage to the fruits identified the occurrence and the number of moths in one locality in the Continental and one locality in the Mediterranean part of the Republic of Croatia, the damages caused by its caterpillar as well as the efficacy of the recommended protection programs. Recommendations for the positioning of the products within the recommended protection programs have been established and pesticide residues in the fruits have been determined. Damages to apple fruits are higher in Mediterranean growing area and it is necessary to increase the number of treatments compared to the Continent part.

TI  - Disentangling factors limiting diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), spatio-temporal population abundance a tool for pest forecasting
AB  - Data-mining techniques play an important role in hyperparameter optimization of heterogeneous environmental factors and their relative contribution as determinants of incidences in insect pest ecological studies. A multidimensional field-based surveillance was conducted in two seasons (24 months), July-June of each season (2015/2016 - season 1 and 2016/2017 - season 2) using sex-pheromone-baited traps and Thermocron i-Buttons to identify key determinants of population abundance of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L., across spatial horticultural hotspots of Botswana. The moth is a notorious global brassica pest. Pearson's product moment correlation matrix showed month of the year (M), mean temperature (Tmean) and maximum temperature (Tmax) as positively correlated (p&lt;0.001) to number of moths (N), while minimum temperature (Tmin), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), mean relative humidity (RHmean), maximum relative humidity (RHmax) and host plant (h) were negatively correlated (p&lt;0.001) to N. Using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) data-mining techniques, two models were developed (a) M5P decision-tree algorithm associated with nine linear models (LMs) and (b) principal component analysis (PCA) based on four principal components. Both approaches identified M as the major predictor of moth abundance, followed by h and farming region (R). However, R was a function of Tmax (positive auto-correlation) and RHmax (negative auto-correlation). These results provide simplified relative contribution of heterogeneous factors in influencing P. xylostella spatio-temporal abundance, essential for early warning systems in pest management. This is an important component of sustainable pest management aimed at managing insect pests and minimizing pesticides abuse in brassica production systems.

TI  - Molecular characterization of primary juvenile hormone responders Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and Krppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) in Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) with clarification of their roles in metamorphosis and reproduction
AB  - Methoprene-tolerant (Met) is a putative JH intracellular receptor that transduces JH signal by activation of the inducible Krppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1). We analyzed the gene sequences of Met and Kr-h1 and their patterns of expression in Grapholita molesta (Busck) immature and adult stages in order to better understand the roles of these primary JH responders in regulating the metamorphosis and reproduction of this global pest of fruit crops. The deduced amino acid sequences of both GmMet and GmKr-h1 were highly homologous to those of other Lepidoptera, especially the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae). Peak expression of GmMet occurred during the last 3 to 5 d of the final instar, followed by that of GmKr-h1, in the last 3 d of final instar. Similar patterns of GmMet and GmKr-h1 expression were detected across various tissue types in the fifth-instar larvae, with the highest expression observed in the head, followed by the epidermis, and the fat body. When expression of GmMet and GmKr-h1 was knocked down via dsRNA injection in the fifth instar, the results were increased larval mortality, abnormal pupation, delayed pupal duration, reduced adult emergence, extended preoviposition period, and reduced fecundity. We infer that both GmMet and GmKr-h1 participated in regulation of metamorphosis and reproduction in G. molesta, the former acting upstream of the latter, and could present biorational targets for novel pest control compounds.

TI  - Destruction of a protected habitat by an invasive alien species the case of Cydalima perspectalis (Walker, 1859) in the box tree formations of Liguria (North-West Italy) (Lepidoptera Crambidae)
AB  - The box tree moth, Cydalima perspectalis (Walker, 1859), an invasive alien species of Asian origin associated with box trees, gained immediate attention in Europe due to the damage caused to ornamental stands and its rapid spread. However, its effects on natural box tree formations remained poorly investigated, especially in Southern Europe. In Liguria (North-West Italy), this species attacked xerotermophilous box tree formations on rocky substrate, a protected habitat (5110) after the EU 92/43 Directive, seriously endangering its long-term survival. Since detection in 2013, this species defoliated almost the whole area covered by habitat 5110, until experiencing a population crash after depleting its only trophic resource. We present here the evolution of the invasion and the population dynamics of this invasive alien species in Liguria during the years 2016-2017.

TI  - Incidence and impact of Sahyadrassus malabaricus (Moore) on planted seedlings of Dipterocarpus bourdillonii Brandis
AB  - During post evaluation on the restoration of Diptercarpus bourdillonii, a critically endangered tree of the Southern Western Ghats, Kerala; incidence of Sahyadrassus malabaricus (Moore) (Lepidoptera Hepialidae) was found out first time as host plant for the insect-pest. The pest had severe impact on survival of planted seedlings and estimated 60-70% loss after 2-3 years of planting. The pest incidence recorded thus becomes the major factor affecting the restoration success of the species in situ compared least occurrence ex situ extent plantation potential of the species.

TI  - Effects of sugar-acetic acid-ethanol water solutions and sex pheromone on trapping Grapholitha molesta Busck in peach-apple neighbor orchards
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study conducted to investigate the diurnal activity rhythm of Grapholita molesta (oriental fruit moth) and explore the effects of sugar-acetic acid-ethanol-water solution (SAEWS) and sex pheromone on trapping the oriental fruit moths in peach-apple neighbour orchards, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the effective and rational use of SAEWS and sex pheromone for trapping the pest. The occurrence dynamics of adult oriental fruit moths throughout the year were determined based on the number of adult moths trapped using sex pheromone. Five trap-hanging heights were designed within 0-2.5 m above ground 0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 m. During the eclosion peak of each of the 4 observed generations, the number of adult moths trapped by SAEWS and sex pheromone was monitored every 2 h at the 5 heights for continuous 72 h to study the diurnal activity rhythm of the oriental fruit moth. Based on the number of adult moths trapped, the effects of SAEWS and sex pheromone on trapping the oriental fruit moth were explored. The SAEWS and sex pheromone performed well in trapping the oriental fruit moths, and the trapping peak occurred at 04.00-08.00 and 18.00-20.00 h during the monitoring period. In a peach-apple mixed-planting orchard, the maximum number of adult moths trapped by SAEWS and sex pheromone was recorded at 2.5 m above ground.

TI  - Light trap as a monitoring tool for common cutworm Spodoptera litura (F.) in soybean
AB  - The population dynamics of common cutworm Spodoptera litura (F.) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) captured by light trap in soybean was studied at the Directorate of Soybean Research, Indore during 2009-2011. In soybean, S. litura adults were not captured by light trap until 30th standard week. Two peaks of sudden increase of moth catches were observed on 38th and 41st standard week in 2009; 37th and 41st standard week in 2010 and 37th and 39th standard week in 2011. Moths caught/week usually began to decrease to &lt;3 during post soybean season. Similarly, intensity of larval population was zero until 31st standard week, and thereafter a peak on 37th standard week was observed during 2009 and 2011 seasons, and 36th standard week in 2010; subsequently, this reduced to &lt;2 on 41st standard week. The seasonal moth catches/light trap were significantly higher in season 2009 and 2011 compared to that in 2010. Likewise, intensity of larval population during 2010 and 2011 seasons were considerably lower than that of 2009. A significant positive correlation was observed between light trap catches vs. larval population during crop season.

TI  - Impact of multiple ecological stressors on a sub-arctic ecosystem no interaction between extreme winter warming events, nitrogen addition and grazing
AB  - Climate change is one of many ongoing human-induced environmental changes, but few studies consider interactive effects between multiple anthropogenic disturbances. In coastal sub-arctic heathland, we quantified the impact of a factorial design simulating extreme winter warming (WW) events (7 days at 6-7C) combined with episodic summer nitrogen (+N) depositions (5 kg N ha-1) on plant winter physiology, plant community composition and ecosystem CO2 fluxes of an Empetrum nigrum dominated heathland during 3 consecutive years in northern Norway. We expected that the +N would exacerbate any stress effects caused by the WW treatment. During WW events, ecosystem respiration doubled, leaf respiration declined (-58%), efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm) increased (between 26 and 88%), while cell membrane fatty acids showed strong compositional changes as a result of the warming and freezing. In particular, longer fatty acid chains increased as a result of WW events, and eicosadienoic acid (C202) was lower when plants were exposed to the combination of WW and +N. A larval outbreak of geometrid moths (Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata) following the first WW led to a near-complete leaf defoliation of the dominant dwarf shrubs E. nigrum (-87%) and Vaccinium myrtillus (-81%) across all experimental plots. Leaf emergence timing, plant biomass or composition, NDVI and growing season ecosystem CO2 fluxes were unresponsive to the WW and +N treatments. The limited plant community response reflected the relative mild winter freezing temperatures (-6.6C to -11.8-C) recorded after the WW events, and that the grazing pressure probably overshadowed any potential treatment effects. The grazing pressure and WW both induce damage to the evergreen shrubs and their combination should therefore be even stronger. In addition, +N could have exacerbated the impact of both extreme events, but the ecosystem responses did not support this. Therefore, our results indicate that these sub-arctic Empetrum-dominated ecosystems are highly resilient and that their responses may be limited to the event with the strongest impact.

TI  - Heterocera fauna of the Calabrian black pine forest, Sila Massif (Italy) (Insecta Lepidoptera)
AB  - In this paper we described the Heterocera fauna of the Calabrian black pine forest in the Sila Massif, southern Italy. We sampled 15 stands at 1270-1446 meters of altitude. One UV-Led light traps per stand was turned on once per month from May to November 2015 and from April to November 2016. We collected 18,827 individuals belonging to 367 species. Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Notodontidae) and Aids repandata (Geometridae) were the most abundant species. Conifers are the main larval foodplant of 11 species and 4,984 individuals. Particularly interesting was the presence of Eupithecia indigata, discovered in Italy outside the Alps few years ago, abundant in pure Calabrian black pine stands. Also, the recently described Italian endemic Hylaea mediterranea was abundant, and together with E. indigata compose and unique species assemblage characterizing Lepidoptera fauna of the Calabrian black pine forests of the Sila Massif. During the spring, communities were dominated by Eupithecia indigata and Agrotis cinerea, during the summer Thaumetopoea pityocampa, Alcis repandata, Idaea deversaria, and Dendrolimus pini were dominant, and autumn communities were characterized by Pennithera firmata and Colostygia sericeata. We confirmed the presence of Acossus terebra, Dichagyris signifera, Acasis appensata, Mesotype didymata, Plusidia cheiranthi, Trichopteryx carpinata, and Lithophane soda. The relevant interest of this fauna was completed by the presence of several Italian endemic species Hydriomena sanfilensis, Idaea mutilata, Itame messapiaria, Megalycinia serraria, Nychiodes ragusaria, and Xanthorhoe vidanoi.

TI  - Population fluctuation and vertical distribution of the soybean looper (Chrysodeixis includes) in soybean culture
AB  - The objective of this work was to study the population fluctuation and the vertical distribution of the Chrysodeixis includes (Walker) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in the leaf canopy of soybeans. The experiments were conducted under field conditions in the experimental area of the Embrapa Agropecuria Oeste during the 2014/2015 harvest. Adult monitoring was performed using Delta-type traps, baited with the pest sexual pheromone. The eggs were collected in the soybean plants and the caterpillars monitored through the beat cloth. The population peaks of C. includes occurred in the reproductive period of the soybean plants, although the adults were also found in the season soybean. Although there was no significant relationship between the trapped adults and the immature forms of C. includes sampled with the beat cloth, a significant linear and positive relationship was found between the egg and caterpillar densities of the pest in the culture. Adults preferentially oviposited on the lower part of the soybean plants, while the caterpillars preferred to position themselves predominantly in the lower and mid region of the plants. However, at warmer temperatures during the day, the caterpillars migrate to the upper areas of the soybean plants.

TI  - Revisiting the distribution of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera notodontidae) and T. pityocampa ENA clade in Greece
AB  - In the present work, we sampled individuals of the processionary pine moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis and Schiffermller; Lepidoptera Notodontidae) from different areas of Greece between 2014 and 2016. These samples were sequenced for a 760-bp long mtDNA COI locus and the haplotypes retrieved clearly showed that the occurrence of T. pityocampa in Greece is being considerably restricted, with only 8 individuals out of the 221 exhibiting T. pityocampa haplotypes and the rest being identified as T. pityocampa ENA clade haplotypes. To that, one haplotype in particular exhibited the highest abundance and broadest geographic distribution, occurring both in mainland and on islands. Our data suggest a rather recent and rapid population expansion of the ENA clade in Greece and a concomitant recent displacement of T. pityocampa. It thus seems that the relation between T. pityocampa and T. pityocampa ENA clade needs to be further and thorough analyzed before the taxonomic status of T. pityocampa ENA clade can be concluded with confidence.

AB  - The European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermller) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), is regarded as the most important insect pest of wine grapes in Europe. If not properly controlled, it can cause significant direct and indirect yield losses due to secondary infections of grape berries by Botrytis cinerea. For these reasons, it is important to preserve the activity of insecticides used against this pest, as the number of insecticidal mode of actions available to control Lepidoptera species on wine grapes in Europe is limited. Following a report of suboptimal control of L. botrana after field applications of chlorantraniliprole-containing products, an extensive monitoring program was conducted in the Emilia Romagna Region of North East Italy to determine L. botrana susceptibility to chlorantraniliprole. This study consisted of 11 bioassays conducted with chlorantraniliprole on L. botrana populations collected in the Emilia Romagna Region in 2014-2016, 5-7 years after its introduction into the market. Bioassay results were compared to results previously obtained from the chlorantraniliprole pre-comercialization baseline susceptibility survey conducted from 2007 to 2011. The Lethal Concentration values obtained for field populations of L. botrana in this study are comparable to those reported for the pre-comercialization susceptibility baseline. We demonstrate that there is no significant change in L. botrana susceptibility to chlorantraniliprole in the Emilia Romagna Region. Emphasis should be given to implement appropriate insecticide resistance management strategies, including nonchemical agronomic practices and biological control methods, to preserve effective insecticides like chlorantraniliprole for future use in controlling the European grapevine moth.

TI  - Seasonal fluctuations of goat moth (Cossus cossus L.) in chestnut orchards in Izmir and Manisa, Turkey
AB  - Goat moth, Cossus cossus L. (Lepidoptera Cossidae), is a polyphagous pest of many fruit trees, poplar, park, and garden trees. Despite being known as secondary pest, goat moth density has recently increased in chestnut orchards in Turkey. Controlling this pest is very hard because larvae live inside trunks and branches and periods of moth flight and oviposition are very long. Intensive, direct spraying of chemical insecticides against these pests is extremely difficult, hence alternative control methods are needed. This study was conducted to provide data on alternative control methods such as adult mass trapping in chestnut groves. The study was carried out during the moth's flight period in 2013 and 2014 in the towns of Beydag, demis and Kemalpasa in Izmir Province and Turgutlu in Manisa Province. Trapping equipment supplied by Trc, Inc. was used to capture adult moths. Traps were suspended from branches near the trunk 1.5-2 m above the ground. Traps were checked weekly and moths were removed and counted from mid-May to late September. The results show that C. cossus adults began to appear in late May. The flying period of adults continued until early September. Maximum adult emergence was between mid-July and mid-August. Population density and damage ratio were higher in the orchards infected with Cryphonectria parasitica Murr. Larvae in different stages were observed under the bark and inside trunks.

TI  - Two European Cornus L. feeding leaf mining moths, Antispila petryi Martini, 1899, sp. rev. and A. treitschkiella (Fischer von Rslerstamm, 1843) (Lepidoptera, Heliozelidae) an unjustified synonymy and overlooked range expansion
AB  - Antispila treitschkiella (Fischer von Rslerstamm, 1843) and A. petryi Martini, 1899, sp. rev. were regarded as synonymous since 1978, but are shown to be two clearly separated species with different host-plants, life histories, DNA barcodes and morphology. Antispila treitschkiella feeds on Cornus mas L., is bivoltine, and has, by following its ornamentally planted host, greatly expanded its range in north-western Europe. In contrast A. petryi feeds on the widespread native C. sanguinea L., is univoltine, and is one of only two Antispila species previously resident in the British Isles, the Netherlands and northern Europe. Consequently, the increase in abundance of A. treitschkiella in the Netherlands since the early 1990s and in Great Britain in recent years must be regarded as part of a recent expansion into north-western Europe, whereas the native A. petryi is hardly expanding and less abundant. In Britain, detailed surveys of parks and living collections confirmed the monophagy of these two species. A search of British herbarium samples provided no evidence for an earlier date of establishment. Information on recognition of all stages, including DNA barcodes, and distribution is provided, and these two species are compared with the third European Cornus L. leafminer, A. metallella (Denis & Schiffermller, 1775).

TI  - Eucosma balatonana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), a new species for the Dutch fauna. / Eucosma balatonana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), een nieuwe soort voor de Nederlandse fauna
AB  - Eucosma balatonana is a Palaearctic tortricid, with a distributional range extending from Southern Siberia to Western Europe. Although present in Germany and France, the species was previously not known from the Netherlands and Belgium. In recent years, its western limit in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia was shifting westward. In 2016 and 2017, the first Dutch specimens (four males and one female) were trapped at three locations in the southern part of the province of Limburg. In 2017, a male and a female were found in the adjacent part of Belgium. All observations were made between May 17th and June 20th. Because the new localities are close to the German sites, but are far from the French border, an east-west expansion is assumed. Observation details are presented, and attention is paid to the differential characteristics of the species, its biology and its geographical distribution. As both sexes were observed, the main food plants (Picris hieracioides and Crepis biennis) are present in the region, and the new occurrences are in line with the westward expansion in Germany, the species is believed to have settled and breeding in the province of Limburg.

TI  - Cycles and importance of larch moth. / Zyklen und Bedeutung des Lrchenwicklers
AB  - The gray larch moth (Zeiraphera griseana [Z. diniana]) is a small moth, which has gained international fame due to its regular and large-scale infestations of larch-wood in the Engadine and other inner Alpine valleys of Europe. While the attention of the general public is limited to regional infestation years, this small-scale delusion in science has become one of the best-known examples of cyclical population fluctuations.

TI  - Using light traps to forecast the occurrence of Dendrolimus punctatus (Walker)
AB  - Objective To develop a model to predict the abundance of larvae of the next generation of Dendrolimus punctatus from the number of adults caught in light traps. Methods For five consecutive years from 2013-2017 the number of adult females and males captured in light-traps, and the sex ratio of the overwintering and first generations of D. punctatus, were collected. During the same period the abundance (density) of the first and second (overwintering) larval generations were investigated in the field. Factors correlated with the abundance of the next larval generation, such as the number of adults, and sex ratio, were identified using Excel 2016. A predictive model using neural networks was established with Matlab 2016. Results The predictive model had a better than 0.92 fit to the actual data and was more than 0.90 accurate. Conclusion The Matlab model for predicting the abundance of the next larval generation of D. punctatus on the basis of adult light trapping data is very suitable for short-term, fine prediction. This method is simple and practical, and worth popularizing for the control of D. punctatus.

TI  - New outbreak of Dendrolimus sibiricus Tschetv. in Siberia (2012-2017) monitoring, modeling and biological control
AB  - The territory of the new mass outbreak of Dendrolimus sibiricius is northernmost Siberia. The present increase in the pest numbers started in 2011-2012, 14 years after the previous mass outbreak. As a result, the area of damage to dark coniferous forests exceeded 1.4 million ha. The reasons for the emergence of the pest population from a depressive state are insufficient moisture availability in May 2011, severe droughts in June-July 2012, and increased mean monthly temperature. A significant decrease in the vegetation index of SWVI occurred in 2011-2012. The hydrothermal regime of the spring-summer period in these years promoted the transition of most of the pest populations to development over 1-year generation. One exceptional feature of the current outbreak is low damage to D. sibiricus caterpillars by diseases and parasites. Favorable weather conditions and a low number of natural entomopathogens contribute to the rapid spread of the pest in northern and eastern directions. This creates a high risk of mass outbreak of D. sibiricus in dark coniferous forests, since the area of nearby dark coniferous stands suitable in structure, climatic, and forest-growing conditions for the pest dispersal is more than 2.7 million ha. Pure cultures of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana were isolated from dead caterpillars of D. sibiricus. Multistage screening made it possible to select a promising strain for the creation of a long-acting bioinsecticide for the preventive treatment of forests. The main selection criteria are high virulence, high entomopathogenic activity at low temperatures (7-10C), and the ability for solid-phase fermentation of plant waste.

TI  - Monitoring and determination of proper intervention time, against coodling moth through the use of sexual feromons
AB  - In the district of Kora, apple is one of the main fruit tree crops. It represents 70% of the total number of fruit trees. In recent years, this culture has taken a very wide range, with a large number of cultivars of tradition but also young people who are quite liked by the internal and external market. The new technologies that have begun to apply for apples are the most contemporary and consequently its production has been growing year by year. In addition to that, in apple cultivation technology are been added also problems related to the management of pests and diseases, one of the most important and pest is the coodling moth which has caused and continues to cause considerable damage in the apple culture, causing damage to all seasonal production. Based on this fact, farmers take measures to protect against this pest, but in most cases the treatments are carried out empirically and without the proper effect against the pests. Therefore, by this experiment, some aspects of coodling moth will be studied both with the traditional (direct) method and with the contemporary method of using sexual pheromones for monitoring this pest with the aim of it's integrated management, to increase the quantity and quality of apple production.

TI  - Biochemical changes in rice yellow stem borer infested rice accessions
AB  - Biochemical constitution of 22 rice accessions showing susceptible, moderately susceptible, moderately resistant and resistant reaction to yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) were studied in 40 days old transplanted healthy and stem borer infested plants under screen house condition. Total phenol increased by range of 13.11 to 43.66%, OD phenol increased by range of 20.00 to 61.29%, total sugar increased by range of 30.62 to 64.35%, reducing sugar increased by range of 33.68 to 64.48% and non-reducing sugar increased by range of 22.57 to 61.17% due to stem borer infestation in different rice accessions. The results depicted that the amount of total sugars, reducing sugar and non-reducing sugars in all susceptible genotypes was found higher compared to resistant and moderately resistant accessions. Higher level of total phenols and ortho-dihydroxy phenol were found in resistant and moderately resistant accessions as against susceptible accessions and indicating that these defensive compounds contributing towards the rice yellow stem borer resistance.

The preliminary studies under field conditions with surveys of localities at Pantnagar, Uttarakhand revealed very less frequency of H. armigera on wheat, which began in the first week of March and declined in last week of April in the rabi seasons 2014-15 and 2015-16. The seasonal incidence on different varieties of wheat and chickpea clearly showed that the wheat varieties were not preferred its larvae (0.35 to 0.75 larvae/10 plants) in comparison to its preferred host chickpea (7.69 larvae/10 plants). A total of 7 natural enemies and two microbial agents had been observed on H. armigera in wheat.

TI  - Determination of generation numbers and adult population fluctuation of Lobesia botrana (Lep. Tortricidae) using pheromone trap in Sisakht, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province
AB  - The European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis and Schiffermller, 1776), (Lep. Tortricidae) is the most serious insect pest of vineyards in Sisakhat. It is a polyvoltine pest and can complete two to four generations in one year depending on environmental conditions. The larvae penetrate berries very quickly after egg hatching and damage the grapes directly by feeding and webbing or indirectly by favoring the gray mold. Its control is necessary to harvest crop in commercial vineyards. In spite of two to four times of chemical control in this region, its population is always high especially in the first generation which is mainly rooted in inappropriate chemical spraying time. In the present study, it was attempted to optimize spraying time by determination of number of generations, population fluctuation and density of adult moths through sex pheromone-baited traps. This research was done in two consecutive years (2012 and 2013) using sex pheromone traps in vineyards of Sisakht, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province. Three vineyards selected which were 1.5 kilometers away from each other and three traps installed in each vineyard within tree canopy at height of 1.5 meters above the ground. The pheromone trade mark was Scentomos and traps were delta type. Traps in each vineyard were more than 150 meters away from each other. Traps were being replaced once every 15 days and inspected once every 5 days. Trapped moths were being removed with a forceps and recorded in each inspection. This trend continued from late March to late September when no longer moth trapped. Finally mean of trapped adults were calculated and plotted against time to determine generation numbers, flying periods and flight peaks. The results of different vineyards and years coincided and confirmed each other well. Pest population graph had three distinct ups and downs during each season which was indicative of three generations per year. The first moths were trapped at the end of March and the beginning of April. Then, number of trapped moths increased until late April and continued in a steady state up to May 20th when it started to decrease. For a long part of June, number of trapped moths was averagely less than one moth per trap per night. From June 20th, the trapped moths increased again and reached its peak very soon at early July and decreased gradually up to late July. Late July to early August, trapped moths were less than one moth per trap per night. Early August onwards, trapped moths started to increase once again and reached its peak nearly about late August. Then it decreased up to 25th September when no moth was trapped any longer. Flight peaks of generations occurred early May, early July and late August, respectively. Flying periods of second and third generations were equal but was shorter than flying period of first generation which makes the control of first generation more difficult. In spite of chemical controls, population of the moth was high especially in first generation which could be attributed to chemical spraying at inappropriate time and insufficient knowledge of farmers about the pest overwintering stage and places. Spring rainfalls during emergence of the first generation reduced the trapped moth adults severely which have to be considered in the interpretation of the adult population fluctuation. The optimal spraying time could be adjusted based on the adults population fluctuation and type of the insecticide used. As usual, the insect growth regulators should be applied before egg laying or egg hatching. Contact and ingested insecticides (e.g., organophosphates, pyrethroids, and carbamates) should be applied after egg hatching to kill larvae as they emerge from eggs.

TI  - Flight patterns of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, in Slovenian hop gardens in 1999-2016
AB  - The suitability of a light trap (from 1999 to 2016), and pheromone traps and pheromone+phenylacetaldehyde (PAA) baited traps (from 2010 to 2012), in the monitoring of European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), moth flights in Slovenian hop gardens was studied. In 18 years light trap collected a total of 13381 specimens (with an average of 743 specimens per year), the number of ECB varied from a minimum of 184 specimens in 2014 to a maximum of 2060 specimens collected during 2003. From 2010 to 2016, of the 5327 specimens captured, 3778 were males (70.70%) and 1566 were females (29.30%). In general, during the ECB first annual fly the captured moths increased after the third week of May, with a peak on 10 June; between the last week of June and the second week of August, the ECB second fly can be observed with a peak during the last week of July; third annual fly was revealed from last week of August to last week of September with a peak of adults at the end of August. Pheromone and pheromone+PAA traps (wing sticky and mesh netting cone models) demonstrated low suitability for capturing ECB males and females. Adult trapped by light trap and pheromone and pheromone + PAA traps, respectively, displayed similar pattern. Average daily temperature and precipitation level influenced the flight patterns of ECB moths. ECB field infestations in hop gardens could be surveyed by counting egg masses on plants and observing signs of early damages by first-instar larvae. Monitoring of moth flights by means of easily handled pheromone traps provides valuable information.

TI  - Monitoring of four lepidopteran stored grain pests with a pheromone-baited traps. / Spremljanje zastopanosti tirih vrst skladinih kodljivcev iz reda metuljev s feromonskimi vabami
AB  - Grain lepidopteran pests often attack stored grains and food commodities. Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella [Oliver], Gelechiidae), European grain moth (Nemapogon granella L., Tineidae) Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella [Hbner], Pyralidae) and Mediterranean flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella Zeller, Pyralidae) are commonly present in Slovenia. In 2015 and 2016 pheromone traps were used to monitor their occurrence in grain warehouse of the Infrastructural center Jablje of the Agricultural Institute of Slovenia in Menge. Indian mealmoth was the most numerous, developing two generations per year. Captures of Indian meal moth and Mediterranean flour moth were most numerous in first decade of July in 2015 and a month later in 2016. European grain moth was the least common in both years of investigation.

TI  - Effect of the landscape environment of a vine plot on the abundance of budworm and their natural control. / Effet de l'environnement paysager d'une parcelle de vigne sur les abondances de tordeuses et leurs regulations naturelles
AB  - Natural pest control is an important ecosystem service depending on multiple environmental variables at multiple spatio-temporal scales. It is now demonstrated that the proportion of seminatural habitats in the landscape increase natural enemy diversity and abundance, enhance the predation or parasitism level and tend to reduce pest abundance and damage. However, knowledge about natural pest control services in perennial agrosystems and in vineyard especially is lacking. Our study examines how landscape complexity, defined as the proportion of semi-natural habitats in the landscape, affects grape moth population dynamics, crop damage, predation and parasitism rates at different dates between 2013 and 2015. In each of three region (Aquitaine, Bourgogne, and Roussillon) our study design consisted of 20 vineyards selected along a landscape complexity gradient. Our results at the national scale revealed a strong context-dependency with negative, neutral or positive effect of landscape complexity on grape moths and their biological control depending on regional location. Landscape complexity reduced grape moth abundance or damage and enhanced the predation in some but not in all regions and antagonistic effects between similar habitat types between dates or between regions were found. Despite this strong context dependency, our study revealed that more research are needed to understand the role of different habitat types between region and time period. Moreover, we have developed methodologies that makes it possible to continue working on natural pest control services in vineyard landscapes.

AB  - From the middle of March to the beginning of October 2014, the occurrence of codling moth (Cydia pomonella) and oriental fruit moth (Grapholita molesta) was investigated in an intensive apple orchard in the village Beka. The abundance of both pests was monitored by Csalomom pheromone traps (type RAG) of Hungarian producer (Plant Protection Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences), and electronic traps Trapview of Slovenian producer (EFOS d.o.o., Razdrto). The first and most numerous occurrence of oriental fruit moth (20.6 males/trap/day) was established already in the first monitoring period in mid-March, and the pest appeared in the orchard until the 2nd decade of September. Moths of the 1st generation were the most numerous. A notable number of males of the 2nd generation was recorded from the end of April to the beginning of May, while the number of captured males of later generations was not higher than 0.4 specimens per day. First males of codling moth were found on plates in the 1st decade of April, and their occurrence was recorded until the first half of September. The pest had 2 generations. The most numerous catch of mass 1st generation was noted from the middle to the end of June (4.4 males/trap/day). Moths of the 2nd generation were the most numerous from the beginning until the middle of August. Catches of both pests were higher on the electronic traps Trapview. The occurrence and abundance of moths were also influenced by temperature, precipitation and humidity.

TI  - Annual variations of the populations of Tortrix viridana L. larvae on the two species of Quercus infectoria Oliv. and Viol (Q. libani Lindl.) in West Azarbayjan province
AB  - One of the main factors in the destruction of oak forests is the oak leafroller, Tortrix viridana, which causes a lot of damage to these forests. A study was conducted in Iran to investigate the demographic changes of this pest over the course of two years and the factors affecting it to determine appropriate pest management strategies. This research was carried out in Gibir Hussein area in 1993 and 1994 with an area of 250 hectares, and transects in 100-m distances in four main geographic directions (north, east, south and west). In total, 30 dwarf Quercus infectoria trees and 30 Q. libani leafy trees, which were similar in appearance (to reduce sampling error), were measured in each of the four main geographical areas. In each tree, four branches (50 cm) were counted in each branch from the tip of the branch to the inside, the larvae of the pest. The number of acorn germinating larvae in acorns of both trees in 1994 was significantly higher than in the previous year, which may be related to the increase in temperature. The frequency of the populations of oak gnawing larvae in the geographical directions showed that for both tree species in 1993, the highest and lowest number of larvae was in the east and west orientation, respectively, and in 1994, the highest and lowest frequency of larvae was in the southern and northern direction.

TI  - Effect of fertilisation and maize hybrids on European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) damage - preliminary results. / Vpliv gnojenja in hibridov koruze na pokodbe koruzne vee (Ostrinia nubilalis) - preliminarni rezultati
AB  - European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis [Hbner]), (ECB), is among the most important pests of maize (Zea mays L.) in central Europe. In addition to the direct damages caused by ECB, damaged plants are also more susceptible to fungal infections, in our conditions mainly Fusarium spp., rarely Aspergillus flavus. Due to the lack of appropriate machinery, direct chemical control of ECB is limited in Slovenia. Therefore, the agro-technical measures are only available to reduce the borer occurrence and damages. Mulching, incorporation of maize straw and destroying host plants are generally recommended measures. Little information is available for hybrids tolerance/resistance or the effects of fertilisation. Several field trials were established in Jablje (central Slovenia) and Rakian (north eastern Slovenia) in 2016 for preliminary study of above mentioned factors. Differences for maize hybrids damages were studied in maturity classes FAO 200-490. Impact of organic fertilisers (manure, crop residues incorporation) and mineral nitrogen (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg N/ha) was studied in long term IOSDV trial at Jablje. Results show that there was significantly higher percentage of damaged cobs in Rakian. Some differences among hybrids were observed; however, for any conclusions more data (years) and more detailed studies are required. Percentage of damaged cobs declined with increasing maturity class in Rakian, while for Jablje this relationship was insignificant. No significant correlations were observed between the yields and the percentage of damaged cobs. For IOSDV trial differences between fertilisations treatments were observed. Mineral N had significant impact on the percentage of damaged cobs, while organic fertilizers showed no effect. Interactions between the two factors were insignificant. Strong linear relationship was observed between the amount of mineral N fertilization and damaged cobs. Increasing rates of N increased the percentage of damaged cobs (an average of 0.12 percent per kg of added N/ha). However, increased rate of N significantly increased yields, regardless of the increase of damaged cobs. Results of preliminary trials indicate possible differences in cob damages between the hybrids (differences in hybrids resistance mechanisms) and on high impact of nitrogen fertilisation on the damage of ECB.

TI  - Monitoring of four noctuidae species with pheromone traps and chemical control of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner 1808) in Tunisian tomato open field crops
AB  - The male flight activity of the most abundant noctuidae species (Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera littoralis, S. exigua and Agrotis segetum) was investigated using sex pheromone delta trap in tomato open field crops. This study was conducted in two Tunisian regions Zaghouan (Northern half of Tunisia) and Takelsa (North-east of Tunisia) over a three years' period (2011, 2012 and 2014). The cotton bollworm H. armigera, is considered as the most harmful pest compared to the other species, which can cause several losses. So, development of an appropriate management program is a priority for tomato crop practitioners. This study showed that the four noctuidae species were able to realize up to 5 peaks in the two regions and the tomato of main season was found to be the best for the moth activity than the tomato of late season. For H. armigera, a summer pesticide trial (June, 2014) was conducted by the application of three insecticides in Zaghouan tomato open field plot. The tested insecticides cypermethrin, deltamethrin and H. armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus-based bio-insecticide were significantly effective in reducing the pest population. The bio-insecticide, which may be a new alternative to manage this pest, gave an encouraging result and confirmed the important effect of microbial control agents against lepidopteron species.

TI  - Toxicity, antifeedant and sub-lethal effects of Citrullus colocynthis extracts on cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - Cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) is very important polyphagous insect pest with wide host range known for its economic losses worldwide. Its ability to develop resistance to insecticides faster to identify alternates like biocontrol agents, plant extracts etc. In the present study the extract of Citrullus colocynthis in different solvents were evaluated on second instar larvae of H. armigera under laboratory studies for toxicity, sublethal and antifeedant effect. The result showed that ethanol based extract was the most effective to control the H. armigera followed by the ethyl acetate. The sublethal concentration of ethanol based extract of C. colocynthis increased larval and pupal duration as compared with control. The percent pupation, adult emergence and pupal weight decreased in treated populations as compared with control populations. The results of this study can be used in integrated pest management program for the management of H. armigera.

TI  - Factors affecting horticulturists' intent to participate in controlling Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae) (the case of Arsanjan County, Fars Province)
AB  - Carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller, 1839) (Lep., Pyralidae), is the most important pest of pomegranate in Iran. Pest control methods are not effective, unless every farmer decides to participate simultaneously. This research aimed to analyze conditions required for growers' participation in the control of this pest in Arsanjan. The survey was conducted to gather quantitative data. Statistical population included all pomegranate growers located in the main areas of pomegranate production in Arsanjan, among them, 262 people were selected using stratified random sampling method. The face validity of the questionnaire was obtained through a panel of experts, and its reliability was confirmed through a pilot test, Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.61 to 0.93. Our findings revealed that cognitive institutions, normative institutions, social participation, trust to other people, garden acreage and generic competencies were able to explain 55 percent of changes in the subjects' intent to participate in the pest control.

TI  - Significance of irrigation treatments and weather conditions on European corn borer appearance
AB  - Increased average air temperatures, winter temperatures, wind, amount of rainfalls and water shortages are climate factors that affect pest invasion. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of weather conditions on occurrence of European corn borer (ECB) (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner) on different maize genotypes under three irrigation levels. This study was conducted at the Agricultural Institute in Osijek (Croatia) during three years period (2012-2014). Trials included three levels of irrigation (A1-control, A2 60%-100% water field capacity (WFC), A3 80%-100% WFC) and four maize genotypes (OSSK B1-596; B2-617; B3-602 and B4-552). At the end of each growing season ear weight (g), tunnel length (cm), ear shank damage (cm), number of larvae in maize stem, ear shank and total number of larvae were recorded. Unfavorable environmental conditions delayed ECB appearance for more than 10 days. In 2014, the lowest average air temperature in vegetation season (18.23C) and the greatest amount of rainfalls (523.3 mm) were recorded, whereas intensity of ECB attack was the lowest compared to other two years. The highest air temperatures were recorded in 2012, in average 19.95C while the rainfalls were 291.2 mm and ECB attack in this year was the highest. The lowest damage of plants was at the highest level of irrigation and hybrid B1 was the most susceptible to ECB. Although appearance of ECB was similar on tested variants, in all tested years, with increased air temperatures and an average rainfalls we can expect greater ECB potential to damage maize.

TI  - Methods of pests prevention and control applied in two organic apple orchards
AB  - The apple production has a long tradition in Romania, but only in the last 10 years, the growers started to established new high density orchards. Beside changing the cultivation techniques, growers had to adjust the phytosanitary treatments in order to become competitive in terms of yield quantity and quality. Recently, organic orchards have developed as an alternative to the conventional production. One of the most important challenges in the organic orchard is to find an ecological way of limiting the pest and diseases action, in order to reduce the risk of contamination with pesticides, insecticides and other elements that can affect the final consumer and the environment. The paper presents data collected from two organic apple orchards at USAMV in Bucuresti and Arad County at "Fruit for You" orchard. Different methods for pests monitoring and mitigation with pheromone traps, evaporators for mate disruption, sticky traps were tested in the two plantations. The results showed that the used ecological methods, prevented codling moth breeding and maintained the pest butterflies populations below the economic level. Instead, sticky traps should be used with reserve, only when the situation requires, as they can affect useful entomofauna and useful birds.

TI  - Research regarding the knowledge and evolution of the steppe caterpillar (Loxostege sticticalis L.) under the center of Moldova conditions. / Cercetari privind cunoasterea si evolutia omizii de stepa (Loxostege sticticalis L.) n conditiile din centrul Moldovei
AB  - Popularly known as the steppe caterpillar, the Loxostege sticticalis L. species is widespread in all the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. In recent decades the species has not caused crop losses to agricultural crops, the caused disasters being in the past. In 2015 conditions, the pest was recorded and produced crop losses at hemp seed from the center of Moldova conditions, aspect that required updating the observations and measurements on the species evolution, mode and frequency of the attacks. The observations and measurements made at A.R.D.S. Secuieni during 1988-2015 showed that the Loxostege sticticalis L. species is characterized as an abundant insect for the study area. Of the 28 years of observation the species was present in the area in 26 years. The total number of adults collected in the light trap was of 4038 specimens, the highest trap catches of 2409 specimens was registered in the first stage (1988-1992) followed by 711 specimens in phase III (1997-2002) and 468 specimens in the fifth (2008-2012) and in the second (1993-1997), fourth (2003-2007) and six stage (2013-2015) the number of adults collected in the trap was between 124 and 163 specimens. The variability coefficient of the species for 1988-2015 period was of 18.9% framing the species in the group of abundant insects for the area. After the annual variability coefficient the species flight have been characterized as very intense (invasion) in one year, intense in six years, average in two years, reduced in seven years, sporadically in 10 years and missing in two years. Regarding the larvae attack on field plants, the highest frequency values of the attacked plants were recorded during the years with intense and very intense flight (1988, 1989, 2001, 2000, 2003, 2010, 2011). The way of attacking produced by larvae was different depending on the species of attacked plants and by the pest population size the attack was manifested generalized or in hearths.

AB  - This study were carried out to determine the distribution, population fluctuation and infested level of Olive moth Prays oleae (Bern.) in Mardin, Gaziantep and Sanlurfa provinces during 2001-2002. The pheromone traps were hanged on the trees in orchards at the beginning of April. The traps were checked twice a week until the first moth was caught, then they were checked weekly up to the end of season. The level of damage was determined by examining leaves, blossoms and fruit. Sampling was conducted 3 times in a year. The shoots 15-20 cm in length were taken from 4 directions of the trees in each orchard to estimate the damage caused by phyllophagous and anthophagous generation. Five olive fruit from each direction (total 20 from each tree) of the tree were sampled to determine the damage on fruit from 10 trees in each orchard for the carpophagous generation. As a result, it is found that adult moth activity begins in early April. Adults of first and second generation were seen together until mid-June. Activity of third generation adult started at the beginning of September until mid-November. The population curves were plotted based on weekly catches. The pest passes 3 generation a year. Damage level was different in each orchard and year. Damage level estimated, in general caused by phyllophagous, anthophagous and carpophagous were 3-5%, 0.3-3%, 0.5-3% respectively. Although adult moths that caught on trap were high, the damage level was very low. In conclusion this pest could be potential pest in GAP region for now.

TI  - A two-year life table study of Glyphodes pyloalis Walker (Lep. Pyralidae) under field conditions
AB  - Lesser mulberry pyralid, Glyphodes pyloalis Walker is a serious monophagous pest of mulberry in northern Iran. In this study, life table parameters of G. pyloalis were determined during 2014 and 2015 under field conditions in Rasht, Guilan, Iran. Data were analyzed based on an age-stage, two-sex life table. The results showed that total immature developmental time was significantly different for two generations in 2014, whereas, there was no significant difference among three generations of G. pyloalis in 2015 under field conditions. In addition, total preoviposion period, oviposition period and fecundity of adults in first generation were significantly higher than second generation in 2014. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) of G. pyloalis in first generation (0.093 day-1) was significantly less than the second generation in 2014. Whereas, the net reproductive rate (R0), gross reproductive rate (GRR) and the mean generation time (T) were significantly higher in first generation than second generation in 2014. Furthermore, the r, R0 and T values ranged from 0.081 - 0.093 day-1, 14.66 - 24.62 offspring and 32.91 - 33.32 days among three generations in 2015. Because of different life table parameters of the pest generations under field conditions, the results of present study confirmed that collection of life table data under field conditions is invaluable for understanding the seasonal population dynamics of G. pyloalis to construct an effective pest management program.

TI  - Geographic variation in developmental duration of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hbner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - To understand the geographic variation in developmental duration of different populations of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hbner, studies on the developmental duration of larvae and pupa in different geographical populations of H. armigera were conducted. In different temperature and light cycle, we systematically investigated the developmental duration of larvae, non-diapaused pupae and diapaused pupae of H. armigera from 4 different geographic populations (Guangzhou population, 23.08N, 113.14 E; Yongxiu population, 29.04N, 115.82E; Taian population, 36.15N, 116.59E; Kazuo population, 41.34N, 120.27E) under 20C, 22C, 25C and 28C constant temperature. The relationship between their developmental duration and latitude was analyzed. The results showed that the developmental duration of larvae increased with increasing geographical latitude. Larval duration is significantly negatively correlated with latitude at 25C, but at the other constant temperature, the larval duration is not significantly negatively correlated with latitude, and the development duration of female and male larvae is similar, there is no significant difference. At 20C, there is significant negative correlation between pupal duration and latitude, but at the other constant temperature, there is positive correlation, and male pupal duration is slightly longer than female pupal duration, but the difference is not significant. The developmental duration of larvae and pupa of H. armigera showed a gradual trend as the change of latitude, and there is a geographical variation. The developmental duration of larvae of the northern populations is shorter than that of the southern populations. In suitable temperature range (22C-28C), the developmental duration of the non-diapaused pupa of the northern population is longer than that of the southern population. There is also a big difference among different geographical populations with the developmental duration of the diapaused pupa. These results further suggest that the geographic variation in developmental duration may be different in different stage and different experiment conditions in the same specie of insects.

TI  - Life history and life table parameters of the Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) on twelve commercial tomato cultivars under laboratory conditions
AB  - Tuta absoluta(Meyrick) is a serious pest of tomato throughout the world. The life history and the life table parameters of T. absoluta were studied on 12 different commercial tomato cultivars. The longest larval developmental period (12.920.11 days), the longest total developmental time (26.200.22 days), the longest total pre-oviposition period (29.310.63 days) and the shortest oviposition period (5.080.43 days) were recorded on Korral cultivar. The highest pupal mortality was found on Korral (23.53%) and the lowest larval and pupal growth indices were observed on Korral (6.57 and 8.87, respectively). The highest and the lowest overall mortalities were observed on Korral (35.00%) and on Valouro (21.67%), respectively. The lowest and the highest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) were found on Korral (0.10460.0005 day-1) and on Valouro (0.15840.0002 day-1) cultivars. Also the lowest finite rate of increase () (1.1102 day-1) and the highest doubling time (6.63 days) of the tomato leafminer were observed on Korral cultivar. Therefore, it was concluded that among the 12 tomato cultivars that were studied in this research, Korral was relatively unsuitable to T. absoluta and can be used in the integrated control programs (IPM) of this pest.

TI  - Effect of leaf litter mulching on the pests of tomato
AB  - Agricultural techniques essentially change the weed flora, pests and diseases of cultivated plants. Our aim was to investigate the effect of leaf litter mulch on the pests of tomato, especially on the weed flora and on three important plant protection problems late blight (Phytophthora infestans), cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). Besides mulching, the experiment consisted of irrigation, mycorrhiza-inoculation and artificial Meloidogyne-infestation. We recorded the natural P. infestans infection, Helicoverpa armigera damage and the species composition and cover of weeds as well. We examined whether leaf litter mulching had any effect on pests, and on the generative and vegetative production of tomato. Our results were that only mulching had a significant positive effect on almost all the measured generative and vegetative production parameters of tomato, while irrigation, mycorrhiza application and artificial nematode infestation had no significant effects on these parameters. Negative correlation was found between P. infestans infection and H. armigera-damage on tomato fruits. Mulching also reduced significantly the number of Meloidogyne-induced galls on the roots of tomato. Application of leaf litter mulch did not affect soil organic matter and soil pH within the growing season. In the beginning of the growing season mulching suppressed weed cover. Later, there was no significant difference between weed cover in the treatments. It can be concluded that leaf litter mulch had a more pronounced influence on the quantity of yield than on the damage and presence of pests and weeds.

TI  - Estimation of development threshold and thermal requirements of Jujube lappet moth Streblo tesiva (Lefebvre)
AB  - Streblo tesiva (Lefebvre) (Lepidoptera Lasiocampidae) is one of the important potential pest as a defoliator on Acacia ampliceps, Ziziphus spp. and Conocarpus erectus of ornamental and forest communities in south of Iran. Temperature-dependent development of the egg, larval, and pupal life-stages of S. siva was investigated at four constant temperatures of 15.0, 20.0, 25.0 and 30.0C using data collected from constant-temperature laboratory experiments under controlled conditions (655% RH, 12 L 12D). Data were adjusted to the linear degree-day model and Ikemoto and Takai model to describe the effect of different temperatures on the developmental rate of the life-stages. The results showed the average hatching time was 19.520.49 and 6.340.20 days at 15 and 30 C, respectively. The duration of each stage decreased with increasing in the temperature up to 30C, so that when the temperature was rose up from 15 to 30C, the average larval development times decreased from 119.433.46 to 36.520.70 days. The pupal period development time ranged from 37.070.88 to 9.320.28 days at 15 and 30C respectively. The egg-to-adult development time took place in the range from about 176.303.58 until 52.120.71 days. The developmental thresholds for egg, larval, pupa and egg-to-adult stage development were 8.97, 7.77, 12.20 and 8.59C in liner general model and 9.24, 10.34, 11.12 and 10.48C in Ikemoto and Takai model, respectively. According to the linear model, the thermal constant was 1023.5434.57 degree days, and 920.8622.59 degree days in liner general and Ikemoto and Takai models respectively.

TI  - Seasonal incidence of pod borer Cydia ptychora (Meyrick) and its correlation with abiotic factors in soybean
AB  - Field studies were carried out at the Main Agricultural Research Station, UAS, Dharwad during kharif 2013-14 and 2014-15 on seasonal incidence of Cydia ptychora (Meyrick) in two different soybean varieties, JS 335 and DSb 21. The crop remained vulnerable to pod borer from 34th Meteorological Standard Week (MSW) to 42nd MSW which followed an increasing trend from 1.10 to 15.20 pod borer larvae per plant in variety JS 335 during 2013-14. A lower population range of 0.70 larvae per plant during 34th MSW to 12.10 during 42nd MSW was observed in variety DSb 21. The highest pod damage of 46.08 and seed damage of 43.32 per cent were recorded during 34th and 42nd MSW, respectively in JS 335 whereas, it was 40.56 and 37.16 per cent in DSb 21 during the respective MSW. During 2014-15, the pink pod borer infestation commenced on 34th MSW in both the varieties which attained a peak population (10.20 and 9.10 larvae/plant) during 42nd MSW. Correlation studies indicated that a highly significant and positive relationship (r=0.77**) between maximum temperature and incidence of pod borer during 2013-14 whereas, morning relative humidity showed a significant and negative correlation (r=-0.64**) with pod borer incidence during the year 2014-15.

TI  - Population dynamics and management of yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas Walker) with insect sex-pheromone trap
AB  - Field experiment was conducted at the Research Farm, Rajendra Agricultural University, Pusa. Pest activity started from 30th standard week and continued upto 41st standard week, meanwhile it reached peak twice in 34th and 37th standard week. Thereafter, its population declined and finally no population was recorded. Correlation and multiple regression between weather parameters and the population of male yellow stem borer moth revealed that maximum temperature (C), minimum temperature (C), relative humidity (%) at 7 hr, relative humidity (%) at 14 hrs, rainfall (mm) and evaporation (mm) were positively correlated to the tune of 0.273, 0.453, 0.075, 0.478, 0.339 and 0.122, respectively with the population of male moth of yellow stem borer, whereas, sunshine (hr) was negatively correlated (-0.453) to that. Weather parameters were found to contribute about 34.60 per cent male moth population fluctuation of Scirpophaga incertulas when acted together. Further, the IPM package reduced the infestation (4.20, 8.82, 9.31% DH and 9.41% WEH) caused by rice yellow stem borer in respect to untreated control (4.88, 23.75, 27.68% DH and 22.72% WEH) at 15, 30, 50 and 90DAT. Moreover, IPM package gave higher yield (50.25 q/ha) as compared to the control (41.80 q/ha). It was also observed that net profit over the control was Rs. 11,825 with cost benefit ratio 12.27 with IPM package in both the years of study.

TI  - Insecticidal and antifeedant properties of methanolic extract of Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Tod on Plutella xylostella L
AB  - The Diamond back moth Plutella xylostella L. is one of the major pests of plants in Brassicaceae that has become resistant to many insecticides. In recent years, plant secondary metabolites play an important role in controlling pests because of their insecticidal and antifeedant properties. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of methanolic extracts of Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) on diamondback moth third instar larvae. Findings showed significant increase in mortality as concentrations increased, so that, concentrations to cause 25% (LC25) and 50% (LC50) mortality in population were 12.01% and 28.58%, respectively. In this research, the effect of sublethal concentration of methanolic extract was studied on demography parameters such as life table, reproductive and population of P. xylostella. The obtained results showed that different concentration had a significant effect on the duration of different life stage, fecundity and adult longevity. Data analysis demonstrated that increased concentration decreased the net reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), finite rate of increase () but increased mean generation time (T) and doubling time (DT) significantly. These findings indicate that M. struthiopteris has the potential to be used as a reliable method in integrated management of this pest.

TI  - Determination of adult population fluctuation and infestation rate of European grapevine moth [Lobesia botrana Denis & Schiffermller (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)] in the vineyards in Sanlurfa Central county. / Sanlurfa merkez ilce baglarnda Salkm gvesi [Lobesia botrana Denis & Schiffermller (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)]'nin ergin poplasyon degisimi ve bulasma orannn belirlenmesi
AB  - This study was conducted in gtc and Ulubag villages' vineyards in Central County of Sanlurfa province during the 2010 and 2011 years. In the study, it was intended to determine the first adult emergence, population fluctuation, the highest population periods, the latest adult flight, number of generations per year in nature and infestation rate of European grapevine moth [Lobesia botrana Denis & Schiffermller (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)]. Adult population development was monitored by sexual pheromone traps. The traps are monitored weekly. Infestation rate of European grapevine moth was determined by controlling 100 clusters of 20 vines. As a result of the study, first adult flight of L. botrana began at the end of April and the pest was active in nature until first half of October. The pest showed high population in gtc with 1333 adult/trap/year in 2010 and 520 adult/trap/year in 2011 while showed low adult population in Ulubag with 39 adult/trap/year. The highest population was observed as 287 adult/trap on July 14 in 2010 in gtc. In Ulubag, a clear peak point did not occur in both years, whereas three and four peak points were observed in gtc during 2010 and 2011, respectively. It was determined that the pest could complete 3-4 generations in nature per year in Sanlurfa. The infestation rate of L. botrana was determined as 52% and 34% in the vineyards of gtc while the rates were only 4% and 2% in Ulubag. It was concluded that the pest can be suppressed by insecticide applications one time in mid-June and mid-July in Sanliurfa.

TI  - Evaluation of a phenological model for the moths of peach, Anarsia lineatella Zeller and Grapholita molesta Busck. in an area of cultivation of peach in Southern Italy. / Valutazione di un modello fenologico per le tignole del pesco, Anarsia lineatella Zeller e Grapholita molesta Busck. in un comprensorio peschicolo della provincia di Cosenza
AB  - In the present research was evaluated for the period 2011-2013 the application of a logistic model for predicting the population dynamics of Anarsia lineatella and Grapholita molesta. In an area of cultivation of peach in Southern Italy, the populations of both species have shown that the fluctuations were predicted with an accuracy varying from year to year and depend on the species. The moth A. lineatella responds to the model with some consistency when thermal spring summer trends do not show strong variations as in 2013 where the higher temperatures reached in February and March resulted in a reduction in the effectiveness of its use. As regards G. molesta, the moth exhibited for all three years of monitoring a smaller fluctuation of the population but the accuracy of the forecast has been reduced to a lower population density in the peach orchard. For each species and each year the accumulation of degree days began March 1 and the model was applied for the first three generations of both species. For A. lineatella was reported for every year an additional generation is not considered in this research. Our investigation showed that the applicability of a model built and validated in another area of the Mediterranean can be extended only after careful evaluation and comparison of the results obtained. Above all the rising seasonal average temperature trends in Southern Italy in the pre-flowering and flowering has caused a lack of response of the forecasting model. For which it is necessary to conduct further investigations for the development of a phenological model to use in peach growing areas where winter and spring thermal show an upward trend as well as more frequent in Southern Italy.

TI  - On aspects of sampling Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) populations and damage in sugarcane
AB  - During 2000-2004 a series of field-based insecticide trials were conducted against the sugarcane borer Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) (Eldana) in carry-over cane. Opportunity was taken to re-analyse data assessing Eldana damage and larval numbers in the untreated plots of these trials. The aim was to examine trends in damage and populations over time and their sampling errors. In addition, the relationship between measures of damage was examined as well as position of damage over time. A sequential sampling plan was also developed. Results showed that over the period August to April, damage and larval numbers increased four and nine-fold, respectively. Also shown was that estimates of damage were more reliable than estimates of larval numbers (average r2 0.71 and 0.64, respectively). The analysis revealed that there was a reasonable association between the measures '% internodes bored' and '% stalks bored' (r2 0.39-0.83). Because the latter measure is the simpler of the two to assess, this association may allow a more rapid estimate to be made of the former, the critical measure associated with Eldana losses. Sampling error was highest in the initial surveys, (August) and lowest in the final surveys (April). Trends in the position of damage confirmed that most damage is restricted to the lower section of the stalk but that, over time, damage can occur higher up the stalk. A sequential sampling plan was developed based on the percentage of internodes bored and using the negative binomial distribution. This demonstrated the possible value of this technique in field sampling for Eldana.

TI  - Monitoring Chilo sacchariphagus (Lepidoptera Crambidae) in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Swaziland
AB  - Chilo sacchariphagus (Lepidoptera Crambidae) persists in Mozambique on the northern sugar estates, and therefore the risk exists that this stalk borer could spread to southern estates in Mozambique, and to South Africa, Zimbabwe and other sugarcane growing countries on the African continent. Monitoring continues under the umbrella of a regional bio-security initiative driven by the South African Sugarcane Research Institute (SASRI). In Zimbabwe during 2011/2012, damage in sugarcane grown on smallholder homesteads in the Rusitu River valley along the Mozambique border in the eastern highlands region were 7.7% and 6.9% stalks bored (n=766 stalks from 41 smallholdings and n=2657 from 64 smallholdings, respectively). No C. sacchariphagus were recovered. C. partellus, C. orichalcociliellus and Sesamia calamistis were identified from a batch of larvae processed at SASRI using molecular taxonomic techniques. These borer species are not major pests of sugarcane in Zimbabwe. Routine stalk surveys and pheromone trapping operations conducted over the same period in strategic localities in South Africa and Swaziland show that this pest remains absent from these countries. Monitoring programmes demonstrate that C. sacchariphagus has not invaded the southern sugar estates in Mozambique.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of the cabbage armyworm (Mamestra brassicae [L.]) and the bright-line brown-eyes moth (Mamestra oleracea [L.]) in Slovenia
AB  - The cabbage armyworm (Mamestra brassicae L.) and the bright-line brown-eyes moth (Mamestra oleracea L.) are polyphagous insect species. From 2008 to 2010, we monitored the seasonal dynamics of both pests in two locations in Slovenia, Ljubljana and the Nova Gorica region. Pheromone traps (VARL+type) were used to precisely determine the occurrence of adults, i.e., the beginning and end of generations and the peaks of the populations. This allowed us to examine the relationship between the quantity of pests, average daily air temperature and average daily precipitation. Our results established that there were two generations of Mamestra brassicae per year in both locations; however, the seasonal dynamics of Mamestra oleracea was not as clear due to low trap catch. During 2008-2010 in Ljubljana, the average temperature during the peaks of the first generation of M. brassicae ranged from 16-19C (sum of effective temperatures (SET) from 250C to 375C) and 20C (SET from 986C to 1,290C) during the peaks of the second generation. We found no correlation between the average number of cabbage armyworm adults during the peaks of both generations and the mean air temperature 35 and 70 days prior to the peaks.

TI  - Hibernation and the adult population development of Mediterranean corn borer, Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre 1827 (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on the corn plant in Canakkale province. / Canakkale ilinde msr bitkisinde zararl Msr kocankurdu, Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre 1827 (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)'in kslama durumu ve ergin poplasyon gelismesi
AB  - The study was conducted with the purpose of determining the hibernation and the population development of Mediterranean corn borer, Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre 1827 (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), which is a pest in corn fields of Canakkale in 2010-2012 years. In the winter months, the hibernation of the pest were investigated the maize stalks remaining in the fields and collected hibernating larvae were stored outdoors in the cages. In February the larvae was recorded daily formed pupae and later continued the adult flight of the overwintering generation. The population development of the pest adults was determined by pheromone traps in the different corn fields. It is determined that the pest hibernates in the corn stalks in field at different larval stages. It is observed that mortality of larvae increases with low temperatures (0C) of winter months and larvae pupate after mid-March with 13-14C daily mean temperature. Pupation period lasted until the end of May with relation to climate. First adults of the hibernating generation started to fly after mid-April. There was three flight periods throughout the season at May, July and the end of August. It is observed that the population density of the pest increases at the end of the season and it causes more damage on second crop corn, which is for silage.

TI  - Monitoring of brinjal shoot and fruit borer (Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee) through pheromone traps and the impact of abiotic factors on trap catch
AB  - Activity of brinjal shoot and fruit borer (BSFB), Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee was studied from the pheromone trap catches during summer 2010 and 2011 in Keonjhar district of Odisha. The pest was first appeared during 3rd standard meteorological week (SMW) in both the years of investigation and then registered an upward trend with two distinct peaks during the month of March-April and May. The correlation studies between abiotic factors and pheromone trapped male population of BSFB revealed a significant positive correlation with temperature (maximum, minimum and average) and negative correlation with relative humidity (both morning and afternoon). Rainfall did not influence the trap catch significantly. The extent of variation in trapped adult population male population due to the multiple interactions of abiotic factors was 82.4% during 2010 and 56.3% during 2011; among the abiotic factors, temperatures and relative humidity had key role in adult population fluctuation.

TI  - Using the technique of vegetal endoterapy against the horse chestnut's leaf miner (Lepidoptera Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimie)
AB  - Described for first in 1986 near Ohrid lake from Macedonia, by Deschka & Dimie, the horse chestnuts leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) a highly invasive moth, in just two decades has spread all over the continent, and caused considerable damages in horse chestnuts populations across Europe. In Romania has been described in 1993. In our climatic conditions develops 3-4 generations per year. Adult moths are transported by wind, anthropogenic transport by vehicles in infested leaf fragments or infested nursery stocks. The most important damage is esthetical, because of fallen foliage but also ecological do to the effect of the reduced active surface of photosynthesis, and progressive decline of trees. Also causes economic losses due to the costs of protect or heal the affected trees. As a consequence different techniques have been adopted in the recent years to control the moth like collection and destruction of fallen leaves where the pupae over-winter or spray of systemic insecticides. They native natural enemies are insufficiently adapted and not able to regulate the leaf miner's population density, even after two decades of moth infestation typical parasitism rates are merely around 0-10%. The chemical control is difficult especially through the application of insecticides; the aerial spraying to treat trees in urban areas requires specialized expensive equipment. Moreover the systemic insecticides may cause side effects on non-target species. The endoterapy technique by introducing pesticides directly inside the trees can be the best solution. Microinjection is a type of trunk injection where small amounts of therapeutic chemicals are introduced directly into the trees body without any contact with the environment. During our experiment a total number of 84 chestnut threes where identified from which 38 were treated with two different active chemical agents abamectin and imidacloprid. Treatment applications were made in May 2011. A plot of 46 threes where used as control without treatment. The analysis of the collected results shows, that the treated trees of up to 90% are protected with endoterapy against horse chestnuts leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella).

TI  - Determination of population dynamic of tomato leaf miner [Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)] in tomato growing areas of Diyarbakr province. / Diyarbakr ili domates alanlarnda domates gvesi [Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)]'nin poplasyon gelisimi
AB  - This study was carried out with a view to determine population dynamics of tomato leaf miner [Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)] in tomato growing areas of Bismil and Ergani counties in Diyarbakr province between 2011 and 2012. For monitoring population development of tomato leaf miner one tomato field from each district was determined. According to the size of each field 1 sexual attractive trap for per acre (da) was hanged and studies carried out weekly from early seedlings period to the end of harvesting. Together with this study simultaneously tomato plants and fruits observed weekly by visual method to determine infection rate of pest. According to the results of this study, adult population dynamic in both years reached maximum level in 5 different time points (in July, August, September and October) in Bismil county, while reached maximum level in 3 different time points (in August, September and October) in Ergani county. The most number of T. absoluta adults on traps was determined as 429 adults/trap in 04 August 2011 and 529 adults/trap in 15 October 2012 in Bismil county, while 251 adults/trap in 20 October 2011 and 395 adults/trap in 26 October 2012 in Ergani county. Tomato plants and fruits were highly infected with T. absoluta both years as 100% in Bismil county, while this level was lower (60-90% plants, 20-30% fruits) in Ergani county.

TI  - Influence of weather factors on the occurrence of spotted pod borer (Maruca vitrata Geyer) on greengram in summer
AB  - Field experiment was conducted to study the seasonal occurrence of spotted pod borer, Maruca vitrata on greengram at Agricultural Research Station, Madhira, during summer 2009-10 & 2010-11. The results revealed that the initial incidence of M. vitrata was observed during 3rd week of March i.e. at the bud initiation stage of the crop. Peak bud infestation (16%) was noticed in 13th standard week. The pest infestation was gradually declined and reached minimum by the last week of April (17th Standard week) with 0.5 larvae & webs per plant and has disappeared. The results also revealed that all the abiotic factors have been found to exert significant influence and they together contributed the per cent variation in number of larvae per plant by 53.48%, 76.83% in bud infestation, 73.85% in flower infestation, 84.61% in number of webs per plant and 55.05% in pod damage by M. vitrata. Maximum temperature has been found to exert significant negative influence on larval incidence & bud infestation whereas minimum temperature found to exert significant positive influence on larval incidence, flower infestation and webbing. Evening relative humidity exert significant negative influence on larval incidence. All the weather variables have been found to exert positive influence on pod damage but non-significant in summer season.

TI  - Rate of spread of green muscardine disease in a healthy population of the silkworm, Bombyx mori L
AB  - Silkworm diseases spread during the rearing through various means depending upon the pathogen. When large number of silkworms is reared in the rearing tray, as a routine practice and if some larvae are infected by disease, they extrude the pathogens by various means into the rearing environment to form the source of contamination and spread of disease. The pathogens are extruded by infected silkworms along with gut juice (most viral diseases and pebrine), faecal matter (pebrine and bacterial diseases), breakage of integument (nuclear polyhedrosis and septicemia diseases) and body surface (muscardine and aspergillosis diseases). The diseased larva/moth/other insects is a source of infection. The pathogens are stable, persist for longer periods in the rearing environment and with efficient mode of dispersal they contaminate the silkworm population leading to secondary infection during the rearing. Several authors have studied the rate of spread of different diseases in silkworm rearing. The spread of pebrine (Ichikawa, 1935; Ishihara and Fujiwara, 1965; Baig et al., 1988), nuclear polyhedrosis (Anonymous, 1990), infectious flacherie (Ishikawa and Miyajima, 1964), densonucleosis (Miyajima, 1979) and bacterial flacherie (Samson, 1987) in the silkworm population were studied by introduction of diseased larvae as carriers. High rate of multiplication and spread are the main characteristic of the fungal diseases in silkworm and white muscardine develops into an epizootic within a short period, if the conditions are congenial. Prabhakara et al. (1997) studied the rate of spread of white muscardine disease in a silkworm population after introduction of white muscardine larvae during all the larval instars. It was a general view that the green muscardine incidence was sporadic in India without causing any damage to the sericultural crops. However, no systematic study was available on this disease. Recently, Balavenkatasubbaiah et al. (2009) conducted one year survey covering all the three seasons in five sericultural areas of Karnataka, India and reported the prevalence of green muscardine disease through out the year along with white muscardine. The prevalence of green muscardine was more during rainy season followed by winter and summer. In the present study rate of spread of green muscardine disease in a healthy population of three popular commercial hybrids of silkworm viz., CSR2 CSR4 (bivoltine hybrid), PM CSR2 (multi bivoltine hybrid) and bivoltine double hybrid (DH) i.e., (CSR6 CSR26) (CSR2 CSR27) has been studied and discussed.

TI  - Seasonal cycles of noctuid moths of the subfamily Plusiinae (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) of the Palaearctic diversity and environmental control
AB  - Analysis of data on seasonal development of noctuid moths of the subfamily Plusiinae shows that the control of their seasonal cycles is poorly understood. At the same time, the available data demonstrate considerable diversity of the seasonal patterns of Plusiinae species from different regions. The homodynamic type of seasonal development has been found in Trichoplusia ni and Ctenoplusia agnata of the tribe Argyrogrammatini and in Autographa gamma of the Plusiini. The seasonal development of these southern noctuids is accompanied by regular interzonal migrations of flying adults. When spreading northwards, they can produce a different number of annual generations, depending on the local climatic conditions, and establish temporary local populations whose longevity is limited by the available thermal resources. Adults of some species may fly back southwards, but it is more likely that individuals from temporary local populations cannot survive long winters and are destined to die. The heterodynamic type of seasonal cycles allows insects to survive in the regions with pronounced seasonality of climate. This type of seasonal development includes univoltine, multivoltine, and semivoltine seasonal cycles. Univoltine seasonal cycles with obligate diapause are known in Autographa buraetica, A. excelsa, and Syngrapha ain (Plusiini). Diapause provides tolerance to both low temperatures and a prolonged period when food is unavailable. In Syngrapha ottolenguii (Plusiini), the same result is achieved by inclusion of two photoperiodically controlled diapauses (winter larval and summer adult ones) into the life cycle. The semivoltine seasonal cycle has been reported in only one species of Plusiinae, namely Syngrapha devergens. Larvae of this moth overwinter twice before pupation. Multivoltinism is common in the tribe Plusiini. Depending on the latitude, different species of this tribe can produce up to four generations per year and overwinter as middle-instar larvae in the state of facultative diapause. However, the characteristics of diapause vary substantially between the species diapause can be deep and stable (as in Diachrysia chrysitis, Plusiini) or unstable and thus not ensuring successful overwintering and steady population growth (as in Macdunnoughia confusa, Plusiini). The seasonal adaptations known in Plusiinae include migrations, winter and summer diapauses, photoperiodic control of larval growth rates, and seasonal polyphenism of larval body coloration. In general, seasonal adaptations of Plusiinae are determined by local environmental conditions and only loosely associated with the systematic position of particular taxa. Only the tribe Abrostolini stands apart from other taxa of Plusiinae moths of this tribe differ not only in morphology but also in peculiarities of their seasonal development, because all the species of this tribe overwinter as pupae and their seasonal cycles are therefore different from those of the rest of Plusiinae.

TI  - Behavioral rhythms of three Lepidopteran pests; Mythimna separata, Agrotis ypsilon and Helicoverpa armigera
AB  - Objectives To clarify the behavioral rhythms of migratory populations of three species of Lepidopteran pests; Mythimna separate (Walker), Agrotis ypsilon (Rottemberg) and Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner), and thereby lay a foundation for studying the migration, and predicting outbreaks of, these pests. Methods The behavioral rhythms of the three species of moths were investigated by trapping with an automatic, black-light trapping device from 2010 to 2011. Results The results show large differences in the dates of first capture and peaks of species' abundance, and in the number of individual moths trapped daily, and yearly, between 2014 and 2015. First capture dates of M. separata, A. ypsilon and H. armigera were 13, 124 and 71 days earlier, respectively, and the peaks of abundance of these species occurred 41, 44 and 71 days earlier, respectively, in 2015 than in 2014. Total numbers of moths trapped per year were also higher in 2015 than in 2014. Most moths were trapped from 200-300 a.m. or 300-400 a.m.; all three species had a diurnal rhythm with multiple peaks of activity. These findings confirm previously reported biological characteristics of some nocturnally migratory Lepidopteran moths, such as resting before sunup, and also reflect group effects on the behavioral rhythm of migratory insects during population outbreaks. Conclusion The annual dynamics and daily behavioral rhythms of the three species of M. separata, A. ypsilon and H. armigera had both yearly and species differences. This study can provide a scientific basis for monitoring, forecasting, and providing early warning of outbreaks, of these migratory, insect pests.

TI  - Population dynamics of brinjal shoot and fruit borer Leucinodes orbonalis Guen (Pyralidae Lepidoptera) in central districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
AB  - The present study investigated the population dynamics of the brinjal shoot and fruit borer Leucinodes orbonalis Guen (Pyralidae Lepidoptera) (an important pest of brinjal crop in Pakistan) to know that how weather parameters affect the population of the pest. For this purpose, brinjal crop was grown in three selected districts i.e. Peshawar, Mardan and Charsadda of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The population dynamics in terms of adults attracted to pheromone traps recorded fortnightly and were correlated with the maximum and minimum temperature (C), % relative humidity and total rainfall. Results showed a significant (P&lt;0.05) effect of all-weather parameters on population of L. orbonalis in different locations. Weather parameters contributed an average change in pest population ranged from 62.39 to 78.98% during 2011 and 57.82 to 82.49% during 2012 in all districts. Results also showed that mean maximum temperature had a significant positive correlation with population of L. orbonalis but non-significant positive correlation with mean minimum temperature and maximum relative humidity. Similarly a negative correlation with mean minimum relative humidity and total rain fall was recorded during both the years.

TI  - Cold hardiness strategy in field collected larvae of Scrobipalpa ocellatella (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)
AB  - The beet moth, Scrobipalpa ocellatella is recognized as a widespread agricultural pest. Cold hardiness strategy of the beet moth larvae was investigated through monitoring seasonal changes at supercooling points and lower lethal temperatures. Furthermore, the role of microhabitat in winter survival was studied. The mean SCPs of the last instar larvae was not significantly different from November 2010 to April 2011. Mean inoculative freezing point (-8.01.44C) of the last instar larvae was significantly higher than mean SCP (-14.90.93C). The cold hardiness of the pest shows seasonal fluctuation in response to reduction of air temperature. A 50% mortality (LT50) occurred at -11C in November and -14C in January and reduced to -18C in February and finally increased to -14.5C in April. Glycerol, sorbitol, trehalose, and myo-inositol were identified components in whole body extracts of S. ocellatella larvae. However, total cryoprotectants could not have significant effects on the cold tolerance. Larvae of S. ocellatella could tolerate subzero temperatures near their SCPs. Our findings show that beet moth larvae utilize moderately chill tolerance strategy during winter.

TI  - Influence of Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera Crambidae) infestation on sweet sorghum productivity and juice quality
AB  - Ethanol production from sweet sorghum depends on the quality of the biomass and sugars in the juice extracted from the plant. However, quality may be compromised by Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera Crambidae) or sugarcane borer infestation. This study evaluated the effects of infestation by the pest on sweet sorghum juice productivity and quality. Sorghum variety BRS506 was planted in an experimental area with 4,800 m2. Samples were harvested at 115 days after planting and the following variables were evaluated physical injury caused by the pest in the stalk, juice yield, total soluble solids in the juice and chemical composition. Additionally, the presence of Fusarium sp. in the stalks was checked. A significant difference was detected for juice yield, with lower values found in bored stalks resulting in a 2.62% decrease in juice yield at an infestation intensity of 4.16%. Infestation of D. saccharalis also caused a reduction of 34% in the plant sucrose content and significantly decreased fiber, lignin and ash rates. Infestation by D. saccharalis in sweet sorghum caused a significant reduction of plant height, juice productivity, and was associated with the presence of Fusarium sp., and sugar and fiber reduction.

TI  - Identification of the pheromone biosynthesis genes from the sex pheromone gland transcriptome of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella
AB  - The diamondback moth was estimated to increase costs to the global agricultural economy as the global area increase of Brassica vegetable crops and oilseed rape. Sex pheromones traps are outstanding tools available in Integrated Pest Management for many years and provides an effective approach for DBM population monitoring and control. The ratio of two major sex pheromone compounds shows geographical variations. However, the limitation of our information in the DBM pheromone biosynthesis dampens our understanding of the ratio diversity of pheromone compounds. Here, we constructed a transcriptomic library from the DBM pheromone gland and identified genes putatively involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis, pheromones functional group transfer, and -oxidation enzymes. In addition, odorant binding protein, chemosensory protein and pheromone binding protein genes encoded in the pheromone gland transcriptome, suggest that female DBM moths may receive odors or pheromone compounds via their pheromone gland and ovipositor system. Tissue expression profiles further revealed that two ALR, three DES and one FAR5 genes were pheromone gland tissue biased, while some chemoreception genes expressed extensively in PG, pupa, antenna and legs tissues. Finally, the candidate genes from large-scale transcriptome information may be useful for characterizing a presumed biosynthetic pathway of the DBM sex pheromone.

TI  - Caloptilia honoratella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) a new species for the Dutch fauna. / Caloptilia honoratella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) een nieuwe soort voor de Nederlandse fauna
AB  - In June, August and September 2016, three males and one female of the leaf miner Caloptilia honoratella (Rebel) were attracted to light in Geulle and the Vijlenerbossen, in the southern part of the Province of Limburg, the Netherlands. Specific wing and genital characters are discussed and its biology is described. The species inhabits France and almost all Central and Southern European countries, including the Balkans, Italy and Spain. This distribution pattern is typically Mediterranean, as is that of its host plants, the Montpellier maple (Acer monspessulanum) and the sycamore (A. pseudoplatanus). Particular attention is paid to the history of the species. After its description in 1914 there are only two records (Macedonia 1950's and Southern Italy 1995) until the onset of the 21th century. Since then it has been recorded from ten countries. It is concluded that this is probably due to an increased focus by moth watchers on micro-moths, rather than being the result of range expansion. Wherever the species is found, it is rare. Localities are widely scattered, and it is always observed in one or a few individuals. This might be due to the fact that the adults are only attracted to light in the immediate neighborhood of one of its food plants. On this issue, targeted search for juvenile stages is expected to be more informative than trapping imago's.

TI  - On the discovery of Arytrura musculus (Menetries, 1859) (Lepidoptera Erebidae) in Croatia
AB  - Background and purpose The moth fauna of Croatia is still insufficiently surveyed. During the last several years, several overviews of the moth fauna for several locations were published and several new species for the country had been found. Only two species from Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive are listed for Croatia. A third is known to occur in the country, but has been omitted due to a lack of recent records. Presented here is the first record of a fourth species from the Annexes - Arytrura musculus. Materials and methods This survey was carried out on one location in Nature Park Lonjsko Polje, on 17.6.2016. The habitat at the location is typical for the area, consisting of floodplain oak forests with Genista tinctoria. Two pyramidal light traps were used. Results One specimen of Arytrura musculus was found. This is a rare and disjunctly distributed species across Eastern Europe. The closest known populations to the Croatian locality are situated in Hungary, 122 and 130 km away. Conclusions This species needs to be added onto the list of Natura 2000 species for the Nature Park and for the whole country at the earliest possible convenience. Detailed surveys of the entire Lonjsko Polje Nature Park and other wetland areas in northern Croatia are needed in order to ascertain the distribution, assess the status and assure the long-term conservation of this species in the country.

TI  - Resistance monitoring of emamectin benzoate 5SG in cotton bollworms in Tamil Nadu
AB  - The median lethal dose (LD50) of emamectin benzoate 5SG when monitored against cotton pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella, it was found to be 0.4282 mg larva-1 for F1 generation and 0.1802 mg larva-1 for F9 generation. The LD95 was found to decrease from 3.3760 (F1) to 1.1564 mg larva-1 (F9). The susceptibility index to emamectin benzoate based on LD50 and LD95 was 2.37 and 3.03, respectively. With regard to number of generations required for 10-fold decrease in LD50, it was found to be 27. Considering the F9 populations as the most susceptible, the tentative discriminating dose was fixed as 1.1 mg-1. Assessing the level of insecticide resistance as one time survey in summer cotton revealed that the% resistance of H. armigera in five districts ranged from 3.33 to 10.00. The highest resistance (10%) was observed at Coimbatore district. The survivability of fruit and shoot borer Earias vitella varied from 6.66 to 15.00% against emamectin benzoate, with Erode population being highly susceptible. The% survival of pink bollworm varied from 3.33 to 6.66% at 1.1 g larva-1.

TI  - Pine tree lappet moth (Dendrolimus pini) in Scotland discovery, timber movement controls and assessment of risk
AB  - The pine-tree lappet moth Dendrolimus pini L. is a pest of pine forests across Europe but until recently was not known to be established in Britain. In 2009, we confirmed a small breeding population in pine plantations near Inverness. Populations have remained low since and are currently much lower than cause economic damage in Europe. Restrictions on timber movements appear to have been effective at preventing spread, but there are early signs of short-distance range expansion. DNA analysis of moths revealed the Scottish population belonged to the southern of three European lineages, and showed markedly lower diversity than a population in central Europe. Climate analyses predict a risk that with warming summers in eastern Scotland it will become increasingly favourable for damaging outbreaks. However, the impact of Scotland's unpredictable seasons and the role of potential predators and parasites are not understood. The Forestry Commission consider D. pini to be a potentially serious threat to Scotland's ancient Caledonian pinewoods and commercial forestry plantations, whereas some others suggest it to be a harmless, previously unrecorded, native component of our fauna. Opinions may be divided, but in the face of uncertainty over its origin and damage potential, an on-going precautionary approach is prudent.

TI  - Monitoring adult populations of Tuta absoluta in field-grown processing tomatoes in northwestern Turkey
AB  - Tomatoes are one of the most important vegetable crops in Turkey. The tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) has recently become a key pest of tomatoes grown in greenhouses or open fields worldwide, including Turkey, Bosnia, Montenegro, and many other countries in Europe. A field survey was conducted to monitor seasonal population fluctuation of T. absoluta adults in field-grown processing tomatoes containing three different cultivars at three locations in Yenisehir town of Bursa, northwestern Turkey in 2011. In each location, which is 2 ha in size, 4 delta type pheromone traps baited with 0.5 and 0.8 mg pheromone lures and 2 water pan traps combined with a light source and 0.5 mg pheromone lures were hung on planting stakes at an initial height of 30 cm to monitor moth populations. Moth flight activity began on 2 June and continued until 11 October. Moths showed 3 distinct flight peaks during the growing season. The maximum number of moths was recorded in October after harvest. Although more moths were caught in pheromone traps baited with 0.8 mg pheromone lures compared with those baited with 0.5 mg pheromone traps, there was no statistically significant difference. However, there were significantly fewer moths in water pan traps with a light source than those in pheromone traps. Moth captures varied significantly among tomato cultivars. The percentage of fruit damage by larvae was evaluated at harvest in September and reached 1.45% despite the insecticide sprays.

TI  - Effect of temperature on long-term storage of Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV-M)
AB  - Codling moth (CM) is the major pest in apple and pear production worldwide. The application of Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) products is an ecologically safe alternative to chemical treatments to control CM. In this study the long-term activity of occlusion bodies (OBs) of the commonly used CpGV-M isolate, stored at room temperature (RT), +4C, -20C, and -80C for five years was assessed. Median lethal concentration (LC50) of the tested OB suspensions was elucidated in full-range bioassays with neonates of the susceptible CM strain CpS after seven and 14 days. The LC50 values at +4C, -20C and -80C storage temperature were between 225 OBs/ml (4C) and 7991 OBs/ml (-20C) after seven days and comparable to the LC50 determined at the beginning of the storage test (LC50 1871 OB/ml). Only the virus-induced mortality of OBs stored at RT decreased that the LC50 could not be determined. This research indicates that the storage of OBs of CpGV-M at 4C or colder will ensure the bioactivity for at least five years.

TI  - Refining the blend optimization of a multispecies pheromone formulation to control apple orchard tortricids in Southern Sweden
AB  - Mating disruption is a widely utilized method for the control of tortricid pests in apple orchards. However, the occurrence of a complex of species with potential to damage the fruit may frustrate the intended insecticide use reduction. From 2012 we have cooperated with Swedish apple stakeholders and a commercial company to develop and test a multispecies mating disruption system covering the most damaging tortricids in Swedish orchards. During the first two years of the project, the multicomponent blend, although promising for the control of the majority of the target species including Cydia pomonella and Archips podana, did not provide a complete population control for the eye spotted budworm Spilonota ocellana. Newly prepared blends including varying proportion (low, middle and high) of a secondary component of this species were tested in the field during 2014. The highest rate of trap inhibition as well as the lowest larval damage was observed when the secondary component was added to the blend at the higher concentration with no differences between medium and low concentrations.

TI  - Connecting the dots spots and bands on the wings of Lichenaula Meyrick, 1890 (Lepidoptera Gelechioidea Xyloryctidae) share a uniform relationship with wing venation
AB  - Recent studies have shown that wing pattern in various lineages of microlepidoptera follows one of two predictive models. In the first, called the "alternating wing-margin" model, dark and light pattern elements straddle alternating veins along the costal margin of the wing. In the second, called the "uniform wing-margin" model, pattern elements of a single color straddle all veins along the costa. However, of the dozens of families and superfamilies of moths, a small minority have been studied in this context. In the present contribution, the relationship between wing pattern and wing venation is examined in Lichenaula Meyrick, 1890 (Gelechioidea Xyloryctidae). Species of Lichenaula have wing pattern elements ranging from spots to bands to mottled textures, and they all conform to the uniform wing-margin model. No plausible support was found for the alternating wing-margin model. In previous studies, the relationship between pattern and venation along the dorsal wing margin has remained unclear due to loss of wing veins and confluence of pattern elements, but certain species of Lichenaula, especially L. maculosa (Turner, 1898), provide evidence that the uniform wing-margin model holds for the dorsum as well as the costa. Previous studies have found that ancestral wing veins continue to influence the development of wing patterns that follow the alternating wing-margin model, even if not expressed in the adult wing, but the wing patterns of Lichenaula suggest that this is not the case for the uniform wing-margin model. Instead, it appears that the only veins that determine the development of wing pattern in Lichenaula are those that are expressed in the adult wing. Considered in preliminary phylogenetic context, it appears that multiple transitions have occurred between the ancestral alternating wing-margin model and the more derived uniform wing-margin model.

TI  - Evaluation of pheromone trap devices for the capture of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera Thaumetopoeidae) in Southern Europe
AB  - The development of reliable monitoring techniques can offer valuable sources of knowledge on the control of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis and Schiffermller) (Lepidoptera Thaumetopoeidae). Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap on the simultaneous large-scale monitoring of T. pityocampa male adult population by using novel trap devices. Thus, the influence of type of trap device on the capture of male adults of T. pityocampa was evaluated in four areas with pine trees in southern Europe; two in Greece (Thessaly and Attica), one in Italy (Molise), and one in Spain (Valencia). Six different novel trap devices, i.e., Prototype 1, Prototype 2, Prototype 3, Prototype 4, Prototype 5, and Prototype 6, were tested during 2015 between July and November. In general, the male adult catches lasted longer in the two sites of Greece compared with Molise and Valencia. Hence, in Thessaly, captures started in early August and remained at high levels until late September. In Attica, captures started in mid-August and lasted until early November. In contrast, for both Molise and Valencia, most of the male adults were captured in August, while male adult catches were recorded until September. From the trap devices tested, Prototype 1 was found superior than the other devices, regardless of the area, with the exception of Valencia, where there were no differences in the overall captures among Prototype 1, Prototype 5, and Prototype 6. In most of the combinations tested, there was a positive and significant correlation among captures of T. pityocampa in pairs of different trap devices, indicating that most of them gave similar population fluctuations. Our results suggest that Prototype 1 should be selected for the monitoring of T. pityocampa male adult population.

TI  - Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) larval population assessment by damage to grape flowers could empty larval nests monitoring be useful?
AB  - A correct accurate determination of the population size is the basis of successful pest management procedures and is of primary importance in the protection against the European grapevine moth (EGVM, Lobesia botrana). During three consecutive years, we quantified the time course of larval damage to grape flower buds and the presence of the different larval instars of EGVM in an experimental vineyard (INRA Bordeaux Aquitaine research center). From a total of 1003 so called larval damage (glomerula), 704 living larvae were obtained. We determined the larval instars of all samples. There was a significant correlation between damage per larva and larval population densities. Intra-specific competition between larvae and avoidance of larval parasitism are the most probable causes of empty glomerulae, and of the relation we observed. We assume that grape damage could efficiently be quantified also by estimating the number of empty glomerulae as a good indicator of larval density.

TI  - Embryonic death as a probable reason for the collapse of population densities in Lymantria dispar (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera Erebidae, Lymantriinae)
AB  - For the first time the causes of mass death of embryos in a population of Lymantria dispar (Linnaeus, 1758) with biochemical and molecular methods are investigated. In this study egg masses were collected in the territory of Russia from two populations, with low (the West Siberian population) and high (Trans-Ural) density and analyzed. Spring hatching of larvae from the eggs stored under constant laboratory conditions at 2C was two times lower for insects of the Trans-Ural (TU) population compared to the West Siberian (WS) population (436% and 867% accordingly). The level of virus defined by PCR for TU and WS populations was 769% and 366%, respectively. The major components of eggs were the same between populations. However, we found decreased concentrations of proteins important for embryogenesis in TU population, such as an arilforin-like molecule and no vitellin 2-like component. Field data were comparable to those of the laboratory, and in TU populations there was a decrease of density. The obtained results suggest that alteration in hormonal balance of the infected with nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) insects may lead to a decrease or absence of some key proteins of embryogenesis in eggs. It can influence hatching of larvae from eggs and, accordingly, population dynamics of the lepidopteran.

TI  - Effect of weather parameters on sporadic incidence of cucumber moth, Diaphania indica (Saunders) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in bitter gourd ecosystem
AB  - The field experiments were carried out to study the population fluctuation of Cucumber moth, Diaphania indica in bitter gourd and its relationship with different weather variables during Kharif seasons of 2014 and 2015 in Varanasi region. Weekly data on larval population of D. indica on bitter gourd were taken through simple random sampling whereas different abiotic parameters were obtained from the meteorological observatory of the institute. The results revealed that the D. indica population commenced from 31st SMW. The maximum population was recorded during 38th SMW (in 2014), during 39th SMW (in 2015). During September in both the years. The maximum, minimum and mean temperature, growing degree day, heliothermal unit and evaporation rate showed significant positive correlations with this sporadic pest where as a negative correlation was established with relative humidity, rainfall and wind velocity. A weather based prediction model has also been developed with different weather indices and pest incidence using weekly average value.

TI  - Two Bombyx mori acetylcholinesterase genes influence motor control and development in different ways
AB  - Among its other biological roles, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7), encoded by two ace in most insects, catalyses the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby terminating synaptic transmission. ace1 encodes the synaptic enzyme and ace2 has other essential actions in many insect species, such as Chilo suppressalis and Plutella xylostella. The silkworm, Bombyx mori, has been domesticated for more than two thousand years and its aces have no history of pesticide exposure. Here, we investigated the functional differences between two ace genes, BmAce1 and BmAce2, in the silkworm. qPCR analysis indicated that BmAce1 is highly expressed in muscle and BmAce2 is more ubiquitously expressed among tissues and enriched in the head. Both genes were separately suppressed using chemically synthesized siRNAs. The mRNA abundance of the two ace genes was significantly reduced to about 13%-75% of the control levels after siRNA injection. The AChE activities were decreased to 32% to 85% of control levels. Silencing BmAce2 resulted in about 26% mortality, faster and higher than the 20% in the siBmAce1-treated group. Silencing BmAce1 impacted motor control and development to a greater extent than silencing BmAce2, although both treatment groups suffered motor disability, slowed development and reduced cocoons. Both genes have essential, differing biological significance.

TI  - Use of pheromones for monitoring and control of main pests of apple in Bulgaria
AB  - The trials were carried out in Bulgaria in the years 2006-2008. The possibilities for reducing the number of treatments with chemical insecticides against pests in apple orchards of Bulgaria, by use of synthetic sex pheromones have been studied. In some species this reduction may be due solely to an adequate monitoring strategy implemented by pheromone traps, indicating the most appropriate time for treatment, thus avoiding inappropriate sprays. The pests that may be successfully controlled using this strategy are leaf miners, apple sawfly, San Jose scale, apple clearwing and leopard moth borer. The key pest of apple - codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella L., which has shown the high resistance to most chemical insecticides used, can be successfully controlled using the method of mating disruption (MD), consisting in disorientation of males, by dispersion of the synthetic pheromone over an orchard lot. A significant reduction of population density of this pest is possible through a combination of mating disruption with application of virus insecticides. The present review paper contains a summary of the selected, most important results of investigations on use of sex pheromones for management of apple pests, carried out by the authors in Bulgaria.

TI  - Life tables of yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas on resistant and susceptible rice cultivars during post rainy seasons
AB  - The changes in the population density of rice yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas and their causes were quantified on susceptible rice cv. TN 1 and resistant cv. Ramaboita planted during post rainy season in 2008 and 2009 under artificial infestation conditions. The 2008 life tables showed an increasing trend index of 1.85 and 1.23 of cohort population in both the cultivars respectively. The 2009 life tables showed an decreasing trend by 0.84 times on TN 1 while the cohort showed a trend index of 0.39 on Ramaboita indicating the decline in population density. The survivorship curves fitted to type IV of Slobodkin indicating that high mortality occurred in the early stages of the insect life cycle. The mortality factors included parasitization by hymenopterous parasitoids, predation by arthropods, infertility and wind blown loss in egg stage and dispersal loss in the first instar migration and some unknown losses, bacterial infection during the other larval instars. Pupal mortality was resulted by the failure of emergence due to parasitization and bacterial infection and unknown reasons. The K-factor analysis showed suspected arthropod predation and dispersal loss during the first instar and loss due to migration and unknown causes in other larval instars were the key mortality factors. The hymenopterous parasitoids, suspected arthropod predators and pathogens have been recorded and their role discussed.

AB  - The aim of survey was to investigate the influence of applied insecticides on European corn borer caterpillars (Ostrinia nubiulalis Hbn.) and damage they made on stems of chrysanthemums in the greenhouse. Term of insecticide application was determined according to the monitoring of the second generation butterfly flight using pheromone (type E, Z, E/Z) on locality Jakovlje. Catch of butterflies in pheromone traps was very low and recorded only at the pheromone-type E. The highest influence on reducing the length of the corridor caused by caterpillars feeding in the stems had spinosad (concentration 0.03%) and lufenuron (conc. 0.1%) contrary to lambda-cyhalothrin (0.02% conc.).

TI  - Dispersal of male butterflies of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa)
AB  - In Central Bulgaria, in a region of expansion of the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), pheromone traps were set in 5 sample plots one of them in a strongly attacked habitat at the border of species distribution and the rest ones-outside the range in a distance 5.08 km, 23.57 km, 30.89 km and 41.59 km, respectively. In the studied area the flight period of male butterflies of T. pityocampa is approximately 120 days, from June to the end of September, with a distinct peak in the beginning of August. Male butterflies have good flight capabilities and are able to fly over considerable distances over 40 km. The predominant part - 88.3% of the butterflies fly in the habitat and at a distance of up to 5 km from it, and only 5% of the butterflies fly over 30 km from the boundaries of the habitat. Two types of traps were used in the experiment and their efficiency has been compared. It was proved that the superiority of one type of trap is due to design and technological advantages.

TI  - Population dynamics of Leucinodes orbonalis guenee infesting kharif brinjal and the influence of weather parameters on its seasonal fluctuation
AB  - The population dynamics of brinjal shoot and fruit borer, was studied during kharif 2009 and 2010 in Keonjhar district of Odisha. It was observed that the adult moths first made their appearance during 24th standard week (2nd week of June) in both the years of experiment and then registered an upward trend with two distinct peaks during the month of August and September. However, the larval incidence was marked from 26th SW (last week of June) in both the years of study with two peak population level during the month of August and September in 2009 and during August and October in 2010. The correlation studies on abiotic factors and population dynamics revealed that only minimum temperature exhibited a significant positive correlation with the adult population level of L. orbonalis. Similarly, a positive influence of minimum temperature on the larval population was noticed in both the years with significant 'r' value during 2010 only. However, the extent of variation in adult trap catch due to the multiple interactions of abiotic factors was estimated to be 50.2 per cent during 2009 and 64.2 per cent during 2010, whereas, 43.8% variation in larval population level was contributed by the abiotic factors during 2009. During 2010 the overall impact of the weather factors on the larval population abundance was estimated to be 55.8%.

TI  - An outbreak of Aspergillus species in response to environmental conditions in Serbia
AB  - The frequency and incidence of A. flavus and A. niger on barley, maize, soybean, sunflower and wheat grain, the abundance of European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) moths and their interaction depending on weather conditions in the 2008-2012 period were studied. Under the agroecological conditions of Serbia, the species A. niger is more frequent than A. flavus, and concerning the crop species, its frequency is highest in kernels of sunflower, than soybean, maize, barley and wheat. A. flavus was extremely dominant on all plant species in 2012 regarding its frequency 100% on soybean, 95.3% on maize, 65.2% on barley, 57.1% on sunflower and 45.8% on wheat. Furthermore, the incidence of A. flavus was higher in 2012 than in previous years. The uncommonly high frequency and incidence of A. flavus infestation of maize grain in 2012 were caused by extremely stressful agrometeorological conditions, high temperatures and drought over the period from flowering to waxy maturity of maize. The precipitation factor (Pf=precipitation sum/average monthly temperature) showed that 2012 was extremely arid in June (Pf=0.57), July (Pf=1.45), August (Pf=0.15) and September (Pf=1.42). European corn borer (ECB) was a second factor causing intensive occurrence of A. flavus on maize grain in 2012. The maximum flight of ECB moths was recorded as early as in July (5,149) and, as a result of this, high damage and numerous injuries were detected at harvest. Those injuries were covered by visible olive-green powdery colonies typical of A. flavus. In the chronology of A. flavus occurrence, these are the first data on its very high frequency and incidence under the agroecological conditions of Serbia. As intensive infections with A. flavus were rare in the past 50 years, the level of aflatoxins in maize grain was low.

TI  - Diversity of sugarcane borer species and their extent of damage status on cane and sugar yield in three commercial sugarcane plantations of Ethiopia
AB  - The present study was carried out under field condition to determine the diversity of sugarcane borer insect species and their extent of damage on cane and sugar yield during wet and dry cropping seasons of 2007 to 2008 at three commercial sugarcane plantations viz. Wonji-Shoa, Metahara and Finchaa of Ethiopia. Of 192 surveyed fields, a total of four different Lepidopteran borer species namely Sesamia peophaga Tams and Bowden, Sesamia calamistis Hampson, Busseola fusca Fuller and Chilo partellus Swinhoe were identified. Among the stem borer species identified, Sesamia poephaga was reported for the first time on sugarcane cultivated fields in the country. Sugarcane borer diversity and their extent of damage was varied across the plantations and among the different factors considered, season, variety and crop type showed a significant effect on incidence and severity of stalk borer. Both incidence and severity of shoot and stalk borers increased in dry season (January to April, 2008) as compared to the wet season (end of May to December, 2007). Among the different crop types, first ratoon showed a significant variation in stalk borer incidence and severity both in the dry and wet season. Among the varieties, B52298 showed significant variation in incidence of stalk borer as compared to other varieties across the two seasons. In terms of severity, the co-varieties and N14 showed significant variation as compared to other varieties. Among the sugarcane plantations, the highest incidence and severity was recorded at Finchaa followed by Wonji-Shoa and Metahara. Sugarcane borer inflicted damage both at shoot and stalk formation stage of the crop. The pest caused 3.5-54% dead shoot and 5.6-28.8% of bored stalk, respectively. This study also confirmed that stalk borers significantly reduced cane and sugar yield by 25 and 34%, respectively, as compared to the healthy stalk. Therefore, the sugarcane plantations could give due attention for the management of complex borer species attack.

TI  - Observation on ovarian morphology and oogenesis in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - The ovarian structure as well as oogenesis is closely related with the accurate forecast of the pest occurrence peak and the appropriate control time. In order to make sense of the ovarian structure and oogenesis in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, we investigated both the ovarian structure and oogenesis of H. armigera female moth under the light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and determine the grading criteria to divide different developmental stages. According to the morphological characteristics of ovaries, the formation of eggs in the lateral oviducts and the characteristics of yolk deposition, the H. armigera ovaries are graded into 6 stages, including stage 0 (the initial stage), stage I (yolk deposition prophase), stage II (yolk deposition phase), stage III (egg maturation phase), stage IV (peak phase of oviposition) and stage V (terminal phase of oviposition). According to the ultra-structural change of the oocytes and follicular cells, the developmental period of oogenesis is divided into 3 stages; the vitellogenesis prophase, vitellogenesis stage and yolk maturation stage. This study is the first research about oogenesis of H. armigera using electron microscopy, which optimizes the grading criteria of ovarian development of the cotton bollworm. The result provides an important theoretical basis for further study of reproductive development of H. armigera, and also has important practical meaning for the accurate forecast of outbreak date and scale in pest management.

TI  - Multiplication of cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hubner) favors the development of fungal pathogen's corn
AB  - Cotton Bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hubner) is a serious pest of crops. General dietary specialization and high reproductive potential is a prerequisite for the rapid adaptation of species to environmental conditions. As polyvoltine species with multi-population dynamics in certain years it's numbers size grows dramatically and increases the damage it caused. Experiments were conducted in Academic experimental ground of the Agricultural University Plovdiv and feed on corn varieties Kolomba (450 FAO) (2011-2012). Under field conditions is found an attack on plants and fruit elements and under laboratory conditions macroscopic and microscopic methods have been determined the certain fungal pathogens. The results of the research show that continued detention of extremely high temperatures (39-40C), the lack of rainfall and low relative humidity lead to increased damage to the grain of the corn. Density of type 1-2 caterpillars (2nd generation) of plant, damaged cobs are over 90%, and found damage to panicle does not have a significant influence on the formation of the stalk. The damages caused by Cotton Bollworm spark and appearance of and decay of the spikes. When reporting found that 86% of them are attacked by Fusarium spp. and 3% of Penicillium spp. After harvest storage at high background infectious disease increases. Sick grains contain mycotoxins. They can not be completely removed by cleaning and fall in feed mixes and processed foods. This poses a risk to human health and animals.

TI  - Evaluation of damage and control of cream-bordered green pea (Earias chlorana Hbner) caterpillars in a 4-year old plantation of common willow (Salix viminalis L.)
AB  - The aim of the current study was to assess the degree of damage caused by the cream-bordered green pea (Earias chlorana Hbner), belonging to the family Noctuidae, as well as evaluate the potential control of this pest in a 4-year old plantation of common willow (Salix viminalis L.). Analyses were conducted in the years 2010 and 2011 at the Research and Education Centre Gorzyn, Zotniki Branch, Poznan University of Life Sciences. The occurrence of cream-bordered green pea on clone 1100 of common willow (Salix viminalis L.) was evaluated in two unifactorial experiments. The aim of the first experiment was to assess the residual effect of sewage sludge applied in the year of plantation establishment, while the second experiment analysed the effect of insecticide applications. Analysis of variance did not show any significant residual effect of sewage sludge on the proportion of shoots damaged by the pest, while the application of chemicals significantly limited the volume of damage caused by cream-bordered green pea caterpillars. In both 2010 and 2011, the greatest efficacy in the reduction of the damaged shoots by the cream-bordered green pea (87.2% and 87.8%, respectively) was obtained after the application of esfenvalerate. The highest yield increment in comparison to the control was recorded in 2010 (6.9 t ha-1, 32.7%).

TI  - Studies on the stability of population equilibrium of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella (Lep. Plutellidae)) using perturbation method
AB  - Nowadays, a basic understanding of population biology is necessary to establish ecological strategies of pest management. In the present study, the population behavior of the diamondback moth after a perturbation was examined. For this purpose, a long-term experiment with three treatments (control, a perturbation using density reduction and a perturbation using density increase) was performed. The experiment was started with 10 pairs of adult moths in ventilated cages under the standard constant environment. The experiment was continued for 10 generations. After five generations, the perturbation was applied and each treatment was replicated 10 times. Adults and larvae were fed with honey solution (20%) and Chinese cabbage, respectively. The population trend and stability were monitored by weekly census counts of live adults, and the data used as a measure of abundance for the population dynamics. The results showed that the populations of the diamondback moth persisted at equilibrial levels when there was no perturbation. On the contrary, when the populations were perturbed using density reduction, the population equilibrium was shifted to a lower level; in this situation perturbations using sustainable strategies, such as the release of natural enemies or the application of microbial insecticides, may set the equilibrium beneath economic injury threshold. While, a perturbation using density increase can cause instability of population equilibrium toward a decreasing trend that may drive the population to extinction. The causes and effects of the findings in relation with the moth life history, resource competition and its ecological consequences on the population behavior were discussed.

TI  - Increased risk of insect injury to corn following rye cover crop
AB  - Decreased pest pressure is sometimes associated with more diverse agroecosystems, including the addition of a rye cover crop (Secale cereale L.). However, not all pests respond similarly to greater vegetational diversity. Polyphagous pests, such as true armyworm (Mythimna unipuncta Haworth), black cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel), and common stalk borer (Papaipema nebris Guenee), whose host range includes rye have the potential to cause injury to crops following a rye cover crop. The objectives of this study were to compare the abundance of early-season insect pests and injury to corn (Zea mays L.) from fields with and without a rye cover crop on commercial farms. Fields were sampled weekly to quantify adult and larval pests and feeding injury to corn plants from mid-April until corn reached V8 stage, during 2014 and 2015. Measurements within fields were collected along transects that extended perpendicularly from field edges into the interior of cornfields. Adult true armyworm and adult black cutworm were captured around all cornfields, but most lepidopteran larvae captured within cornfields were true armyworm and common stalk borer. Cornfields with a rye cover crop had significantly greater abundance of true armyworm and greater proportion of injured corn. Both true armyworm abundance and feeding injury were significantly greater in the interior of cornfields with rye. Common stalk borer abundance did not differ between cornfields with or without rye cover. Farmers planting corn following a rye cover crop should be aware of the potential for increased presence of true armyworm and for greater injury to corn.

TI  - Survey on bio-ecology of Tortrix viridana and its distribution in West-Azerbaijan province
AB  - The oak leaf roller moth (Tortrix viridana L.) is one of the most important oak pests in Iran. In order to investigate the fluctuation changes of this pest, weekly samplings of its different life stages were done in West-Azerbayjan. The number of larval instars were determined by growing and measuring the head capsula width of 1000 larvae at different ages. The effect of host plant on weight changes of final instar larvae and pupae on three oak species of Quercus infectoria, Q. brantii, and Q. libani was studied. Populational changes of adult insects were investigated using 10 triangle pheromone traps. Five larval instars were determined for this pest. Neonate larvae of the pest started their activities from late March in Mirabad and from early April in Paradanan. The formed larvae and pupae on gall oak (Q. infectoria) weighed more than the ones grown on the other two oak species. Adult insects were first captured on May 23 in Mirabad (6.2 insects in each trap). The highest degree of pest capture was also recorded at the peak time of pest population with the average of 132 insects in each trap in Mirabad which indicated that this area is highly infected with the pest. The oak leaf roller moths stopped their activity in mid-July in all of the studied areas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) in a cotton production area
AB  - Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) are major pests of cotton in Greece and elsewhere. Analysing male captures in pheromone traps over two seasons, in two cotton producing sites in central Greece, the spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics were examined. In 2007, captures of male H. armigera increased in late July and maintained at high levels for 1 month and declined at the end of August. For P. gossypiella, male captures remained at low levels during summer, increased late in August, peaked at mid of September and declined toward the end of the season. In 2008, trap captures of both species increased sharply by the end of June and remained at relatively high levels until August and September for P. gossypiella and H. armigera, respectively. Spatial analysis produced a spatial trend map over space, a temporal stability map over time and a spatial and temporal trend map for both species, which could lead in separating the field into management zones, and direct control to areas that exhibit high densities of the pest population and are stable over time.

TI  - The correlation analysis among sex pheromone trap catch, leaf loss rate and population density of Chinese-pine caterpillar Dendrolimus tabulaeformis
AB  - To evaluate the relationships among sex pheromone trap catch, leaf loss rate and population density of Chinese-pine caterpillar Dendrolimus tabulaeformis in forest with different damage degrees, leaf loss rates, population densities of larvae and catches of adults were investigated by using a five-point chessboard sampling method, and the optimal fitting models of paired-comparisons were conducted. The results showed that, the low (y1) and high (y2) population densities of larvae could be estimated by quadratic curves with adults catches (x1), (x2), and the equations were y1=-0.060x12+6.174x1-85.753 and y2=0.076x22-3.111x2+109.844, respectively. When the larvae population density was very high (y3), adults catches (x3) had a linear reduction in the case, and y3=-1.795x3+214.060. The population density of larvae (y) and adults catches (x) increased with the increase of leaf loss rate (z), and when leaf loss rate exceeded 74%, larvae population density showed a declining trend and the equation was y=-794.937z2+1 188.218z-308.626. When leaf loss rate was higher than 72%, adults catches (x) decreased, and x=-189.035z2+272.314z-53.474. The results indicated that the adults catches had significant correlation with the population density of larvae at the low and high population densities; the adults catches decreased at the higher population density. The relationships between both population density and adults catches and leaf loss rate could be described by a quadratic function.

TI  - The Sphingidae (Insecta Lepidoptera) in Feng-Huang Nature Education Area, Experimental Forest, NTU
AB  - Sphingids are a family of moth with moderate to large size. The behavior of its larvae and imago are suitable for education and also for promoting observation of moths. In this study, diversity changes of sphingids in different seasons were observed, and the ecological regular monthly survey has been done. During the studying period (November 2013 to October 2014), mercury lamps are used to attract Sphingids, which resulted in 20 genera and 29 species with a total of 61 individual found. After a year survey, 39.3 percent of sphingids are active in spring (March to May) and 42.6 percent in summer (June to August). Therefore, this study assumed that spring and summer are the major active seasons for sphingids. During this study period, Acosmeryx castanea, Cechenena minor, Marumba cristata and Parum colligate appeared the most, and the appearance of them covered two to three seasons, it could be identified as the major species of Feng-Huang Nature Education Area. Further, the check list of host plants of sphingids was also provided. For these plants, exotic species and native species accounted for roughly equal proportion. Mostly belong to positive species or forest edge plants on earlier succession of plant communities, and few moths feeding on late successional plants.

TI  - Food habits of introduced Japanese weasels (Mustela itatsi) and their impacts on the native species of Toshima, Izu Island
AB  - Japanese weasels (Mustela itatsi) were introduced on Toshima, Izu Islands, for rat population control in 1934. Since then, they have been invading the island ecosystem. We studied the inhabiting situation and food habits of the weasels by analyzing their feces. A field survey was conducted during the four seasons of 2014, and 71 fecal samples were collected. The fecal contents of Toshima weasels revealed seasonal changes and a high presence of bird fragments (bones and/or feather) compared with that reported in other previous studies on the food habits of weasels in various parts of Japan. The number of items included in the feces of Toshima weasels was less compared with that in the feces of Miyakejima weasels, which suggests that Toshima weasels use restricted food resources. In 2014, the camellia afforestation of Toshima experienced an outbreak of geometrid moths (Biston robustus robustus). These moths are a major food source for Toshima weasels. Thus, if the outbreak of moth terminates, the target prey of the weasels might change, leading to another significant impact on the island ecosystem.

TI  - Remarkable records of Macrolepidoptera in Sweden 2015. / Intressanta fynd av storfjrilar (Macrolepidoptera) i Sverige 2015
AB  - This is the 43th consecutive annual report on interesting finds and provincial records of Macrolepidoptera in Sweden. One Macrolepidoptera species is reported new to Sweden. The clearwing moth Synanthedon aurivillii recently again separated from the sibling species S. polaris. The species is native in the country. 53 new provincial records are reported. A number of interesting migrants were observed like Rhodometra sacraria, Agrius convolvuli, Macroglossum stellatarum, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, Nycteola asiatica, Cryphia muralis, Hydraecia ultima, Spodoptera exigua, Atethmia centrago, Agrotis bigramma, Peridroma saucia, Xestia ditrapezium, Heliothis armigera and Heliothis peltigera. A late migration of the resident species Noctua janthe and N. janthina was also observed in the second half of August. Cryphia algae and Agrotis puta are now established at the south coast of Skne and C. algae also on Gotland. There was also an astonishing find of Mniotype bathensis, the second time in Sweden. The observation was made in the subalpine region in Hrjedalen, and raises the question if it belongs to a local population or if it is a migrant. The delayed season and warm weather in August in this region also produced a number of other interesting finds like Xestia sincera and X. lorezi which normally only flies even years. The number of Macrolepidoptera found in Sweden is now 1116, of which 14 are introduced.

TI  - Influence of weather factors on the trapped population of spotted bollworm (E. vittella F and E. insulana B) under Bahawalpur agro-ecosystem
AB  - The study was initiated at Entomological Research Institute, Ayub Agricultural Research Institute, Faisalabad, to determine the impact of weather factors in population fluctuation of spotted bollworm Earias sp (E. vittella F and E. insulana B) during 2009 to 2011. On each spot three pheromone traps each ten meters apart were installed in cotton-wheat growing area of Bahawalpur. The data on trapped population of spotted bollworm were recorded fortnightly. The population of the pest remained present throughout the study years. However, the highest peaks were recorded on 10.11.2009 (14.98/trap), on 5.11.2010 (33.22/trap) and on 2.8.2011 (5.60/trap) with maximum, minimum, average temperatures and RH of 32.73C, 13.00C, 23.78C and 66%; 32.47C, 16.00C, 24.24C and 75% and 4.53C, 26.27C, 33.40C and 79.27%, respectively. None of the weather factors showed significant correlation with the pest for individual year and on cumulative basis. Maximum temperature during 2009, relative humidity during 2010, minimum temperature during 2011 and relative humidity on cumulative basis were important resulted in maximum impact i.e. 8.1, 13.9, 15.9 and 7.0%, respectively in population fluctuation of the pest.

TI  - Determination of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (Lep. Tortricidae), generation numbers and adult population fluctuation in Yasouj through two different methods
AB  - Population fluctuation of adult codling moth was studied in Yasouj through two methods, (1) sex pheromone-baited trapping and (2) collecting of larvae and maintaining them in natural conditions, to determine its appropriate spraying time. In the first method, three generations of adults emerged from mid-April to early June (45 days), late May to mid-July (60 days) and mid-July to mid-September (60 days). Their flight peaks occurred after mid-April, after mid-June and early August. At the time of flight peak, second and third generation adult populations were equal but twice as high as first generation adult population. In the second method, three generations of adults emerged during April (25 days), early June to mid-July (45 days) and mid-July to late August (45 days). Their flight peaks occurred in mid-April, mid-June and end July. Both methods were congruent for showing population fluctuation. Flying periods of the second and third generations were equal but longer than flying period of the first generation. Flying periods in the second method were shorter than flying periods in the first method. Flight peaks of both methods coincided but with slight delay for the first method. Some of first generation larvae remained dormant for one year and emerged as adults next year which shows that some individuals were monovoltine. Spraying time for the study area can be adjusted according to the findings of this study and the type of pesticide which have to be used.

TI  - Intraspecific divergence between Grapholitha molesta (Tortricidae, Lepidoptera) populations from Italy and Greece in relation to temperature
AB  - Genetic changes contributing to phenotypic and phenological differences within or between species have been identified for a handful of traits, but the relationship between alleles underlying intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence is largely unknown. Particularly for economically important insects macroscopic diagnosis and assessment of species boundaries and related population dynamics is often problematic because of the limited morphological and/or biological traits. In this work we attempt to compare temperature driven physiological responses of Grapholita molesta populations from different areas along with an initial phylogenetic analysis. To evaluate region-specific moth phenology patterns, we used the data sets of flights during two successive growth seasons (2011 and 2012). Population sizes of G. molesta moth phenology depended strongly on the particular location of research and model performance that were applied to predict population dynamics was less effective in predicting the related data sets. In addition, several individuals from two populations (Italy and Greece) were screened with two mtDNA loci (761 bp and 627 bp in length) revealing the levels of intraspecific divergence within this species between different geographic regions. Besides that, however, DNA barcoding revealed that at least two species other than G. molesta were also attracted by the G. molesta lures. It was thus made evident that DNA-based approaches can shed more light into variation in phenology observed among populations of the same species. With that, more work is on the way, including a comprehensive population study and a rigorous sampling of many more geographical regions to offer a more robust explanation of intraspecific divergence.

TI  - Importance of the diamondback moth in the Niayes in Senegal relations with temperature and cabbage cultivars. / Importance de la "Teigne du chou" dans les Niayes au sngal interrelations avec la temprature et les cultivars utiliss
AB  - Importance of populations of diamondback moth in the Niayes area is studied in relation to temperature and cabbage cultivars used by farmers. Three areas were chosen for a total of 59 cabbage fields as follows 20 in South, 22 in Center and 17 in the North of Niayes. Plots were sampled every 21 days and 24 plants in each plot were observed. Sampling was carried over two seasons from October to January and from February to May. Climate data were collected using temperature and relative humidity recorders installed in six plots (two per zone). Each plot was numbered and georeferenced by GPS. The number of P. xylostella was greater in the South than in the Centre and North. A correlation was observed between abundance of the pest and temperature. Infestation of the diamondback moth populations were not influenced by cultivar. Their tolerance decreased as pest pressure increased.

TI  - Population build up of rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) under mid-hill conditions of Himachal Pradesh
AB  - The rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) has attained the status of major pest during the last few years in major rice growing areas of India. The studies pertaining to population build up of rice leaf folder were carried out by different methods, viz. light trap catch, sweep net method, larval population count and leaf infestation estimation, at Rice and Wheat Research Centre, Malan of CSK Himachal Pradesh Krishi Vishvidyalaya during kharif, 2012. Population build up of rice leaf folder through light trap revealed the prevalence of two species of leaf folder, viz. C. medinalis and Brachmia arotraea Meyrick. Among these species, C. medinalis was found to be the predominant one. The adults of leaf folder started appearing during 3rd week of July in light trap and during 4r week of July in sweep net. The peak adult activity was recorded in 4th week of August. The maximum mean trap catch of the adult leaf folder was 43 adults/week whereas 31.5 adults per five sweeps were caught. The leaf folder larvae started appearing during 2nd week of August and reached the peak larval population level (65 larvae/100 leaves) during 4th week of September. The leaf folder infestation on leaves was noticed in second week of August (0.3%) which increased gradually reaching the peak leaf infestation (61.9%) during 2nd week of October. The correlation between adult catches with abiotic factors revealed that the relative humidity (morning and evening) favours the leaf folder build up. However, maximum and minimum temperature had negative impact on leaf folder abundance as indicated by significant negative correlation. The information thus generated through present studies can be utilized for timely application of different integral components of integrated pest management for the control of the pest.

TI  - Remarkable records of Microlepidoptera in Sweden during 2015. / Anmrkningsvrda fynd av smfjrilar (Microlepidoptera) i Sverige 2015
AB  - This is the 43rd annual presentation of remarkable records of Microlepidoptera in Sweden. The weather during the first half of the field season in 2015 was unfavourable with many windy days and a lot of precipitation. Only a few short periods were later suitable for migration, the most noticeable one in the beginning of July but also later in the autumn. As a consequence of the bad weather the abundance of Lepidoptera was rather poor, both regarding the number of found species and the observed number of specimens, especially in the north part of Sweden, where the snow remained over the whole summer in many mountain areas. In spite of better weather with high temperature and favourable winds during August-October, the comparatively low number of species and individuals prevailed. Five species new to Sweden are reported Cosmopterix pulchrimella Chambers, 1875 is undoubtedly introduced, possibly with food for turtles. Dichomeris derasella (Denis & Schiffermller, 1775) has been found in the Natural History Museum, Stockholm in coll. Boheman, who obviously collected a single specimen in the province of Skne in the middle of the 19th century. Delplanqueia inscriptella (Duponchel, 1836) is indigenous in Sweden since long and is a sibling species of D. dilutella (Denis & Schiffermller, 1775). Catoptria conchella (Denis & Schiffermller, 1775) has been discovered in the Natural History Museum, Stockholm, and was collected in Sweden during the 19th century. Udea fulvalis (Hbner, 1809) is considered a migrant. The total number of recorded species of Microlepidoptera in Sweden is 1749, including the species dealt with in this paper.

TI  - Potato tuber moth - increasingly important potato pest in Serbia. / Krompirov moljac - sve vaznija tetoina krompira u Srbiji
AB  - By the end of the last and the beginning of this century, the changed climate conditions, with long, hot periods, frequently accompanied by drought or minimal rainfall, have resulted in the appearance of new, previously little known pests. One of them is a potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella Zell. (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae), widespread in tropical and subtropical potato growing regions, whose caterpillars damage both plants in the field and stored potato tubers. Damage caused by this species was recorded in our country in previous years and even decades but, since they were random and rare, growers did not pay much attention to them. However, from 2009 to 2013, a very high population of potato tuber moth was recorded in the region of Leskovac (southeastern Serbia), causing considerable economic damage (of up to 100%). This resulted in lower potato quality and the reduction of total area under ware potatoes in this region and, ultimately, the decision of producers to grow other crops. Nearly catastrophic damage was observed on potato in 2015 in the area of the West Morava River (near Cacak), while damage was also recorded in southern Banat, Backa and Srem. Having in mind its economic importance, as well as its likely further expansion in Serbia, special attention must be paid to this pest in the future. The authors describe potato tuber moth, its distribution, morphological characteristics, biology and symptoms of attack, including its occurrence in Serbia and surrounding countries, and the possible methods of control.

TI  - Long corollas as nectar barriers in Lonicera implexa interactions between corolla tube length and nectar volume
AB  - Long corollas are a classical example of nectar barriers, because they prevent undesired visitors from consuming the reward intended for more effective pollinators. As the investment in nectar barriers increases, flower attractiveness and nectar rewards may also increase to maintain loyal visitation of most effective pollinators; and flowers may become more prone to nectar robbing. We evaluated the effect of nectar barriers (corolla tube length), two related traits (nectar volume and upper lip size) and the associated risk of nectar robbing, on the fecundity of Lonicera implexa plants from three populations differing in the abundance of its most efficient pollinator, the hummingbird hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. Corolla tube length varied most among individuals within populations (45-46% of total variance) and inflorescences within individuals (23-32%), and showed little variation among populations (0.2-11%). Longer corolla tubes were always associated with larger nectar volumes and larger upper lips, although the strength of the relationships varied across populations and years. Robbing frequency increased with corolla tube length, decreased with nectar volume and upper lip size, and its weak effects on fecundity were predominantly positive. Plant fecundity peaked at two different optima long corollas with little nectar and short corollas with abundant nectar. However, the exact shape of the interaction between corolla length and nectar volume, as well as the combination of traits showing the highest fecundity, differed between populations and years. This variation could be explained by among-population differences in pollinator assemblages, and inter-annual changes in resources dedicated to reproduction. Our study shows that large nectar volumes can modulate the effect of corolla length as a nectar barrier, and that the combination of these two traits that maximises fecundity may be related to the identity of pollinators within each population.

TI  - An annotated checklist of the Noctuoidea of Jordan with remarks on ecology, phenology and zoogeography. Part I Erebidae & Euteliidae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - A complete list of the presently known 94 Erebidae and 2 Euteliidae especies of Jordan is presented, and the biogeography, phenology and distribution of the same are discussed. Within a German-Israeli project to monitor the Lepidoptera Fauna of the Levant we record from 1986 to 2010 a total of 96 species, 26 of which (27.1%) are new records for the country. In Jordan the Erebidae are represented by 7 subfamilies and 37 genera, the 2 Euteliidae are within the same genus. Most of the recorded species belong to the Catocalinae (63) and Eublemminae (22), the majority of the species are of an Eremic (43), Mediterranean (23) and Irano-Turanian (16) distribution pattern. Most of the Erebidae (55) are clearly concentrated within one vegetation zone, while the 16 species of tropical origin (ubiquitous, polyphagous) are distributed often all over the country. In Jordan almost all the Eremic and Irano-Turanian species known from the Levant are found, whereas the Mediterranean, Tropical and Palearctic elements of the same region are represented only by about half, or even less of the known species. Forty species are uni-voltine with the highest rate of occurrence in spring from March to April; the other species are multi-voltine, flying at least twice - in spring and again later in autumn - from October to November. During the summer practically only multi-voltine species are found.

AB  - The box-tree pyralid in the box-tree forest near Grenzach-Wyhlen - monitoring results from 2010 to April 2015 The Box-tree pyralid (Cydalima perspectalis) is originally native in East Asia. Its introduction into Europe (Weil am Rhein, Southwest Germany) occurred probably in the year 2007 by trade of plants for planting. Since its first evidence a lot of further confirmations have been emerged e.g. for Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Austria, Liechtenstein, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Belgium and Turkey and other European Countries. The yearly spread of the moth in the region of Basel (Switzerland) is about 5 km. In conjunction with a contemporaneous invasion by the likewise new fungus Cylindrocladium buxicola infestation of the hundreds of years old Box-tree forest near Grenzach-Whylen (Baden-Wrttemberg) led to total skeletonizing in 2010. Apart from the invasion chronicle this paper contains the results of the Box-tree pyralid monitoring since the year 2010.

TI  - Analysis of outbreak of tobacco caterpillar, Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) on soybean
AB  - An investigation was carried out to study the effect of various weather parameters on the occurrence of larva and adult population of Spodoptera litura and their factors for outbreak of this pest in soybean in Banswara, Rajasthan. The moth populations of S. litura were active from August to mid-October and decreased sharply in late October. The peak appearance was observed during September-October months and corresponded with peak activity of egg masses and larval population in soybean contributed to the outbreak of this pest during the reproductive stage of the crop. Overall correlation studies confirmed that the fluctuations in the male moth catches of S. litura per pheromone trap is mainly due to weather factors like, maximum temperature, rainfall, sunshine and wind speed. Moth population in pheromone traps will be used as a warning situation indicating the occurrence of larvae in the host for potential attack and to initiate timely management of S. litura in soybean.

TI  - Anthropogenic factors and phytosanitary destabilization
AB  - Many of the phytosanitary problems encountered in farming in Russia are the more noticeable consequences of human activities, such as an increase in areas of wasteland due to withdrawal of arable land from crop rotations (resulting in them becoming overgrown with weeds and acting as reservoirs of noxious organisms), abandonment of tried and tested farming technologies, soil pollution etc. The main destabilizing factors contributing to the accumulation and spread of harmful pests and diseases are recognized as the demise of crop rotations, overabundance of cereal crops, a transition to surface tillage, sowing into stubbles of predecessor crops and removal of large areas of land from crop rotations. The nature and character of qualitative and quantitative changes in species diversity, intrapopulation structure and population dynamics of harmful and beneficial organisms affected by biotic and abiotic (anthropogenic) impacts have been investigated in the Stavropol Territory in southern Russia since 1990. Monitoring in 5 areas of the region in 2005-10 in wastelands derived from abandoned crop rotations showed an increase in the number of pests as well as a high number of species present (57-86 species). The situation was complicated by the transformation of previously insignificant species into ones causing economic damage; in the course of the 5 years, 9 crops exhibited new harmful species which could not be controlled by a single application of pesticide (fungicide, insecticide), one such being cotton bollworm [Helicoverpa armigera] which in 2010 was found on sunflower, flax, apple and grapes in addition to its traditional host crop plants. Among the results of the appearance of new pests are an increased use of pesticides and the development of pesticide resistance. The strategies and tactics for overcoming these problems suggested include operational monitoring, improvement of farming techniques, regulation of chemical methods, and development and use of new pesticides and biological control methods.

TI  - Control of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera in Tunisian tomato open field plot by the application of some insecticides
AB  - The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera is considered a serious pest that attacks tomato in Tunisia and in other countries around the world. Thus, it is a necessity to control this pest and to establish a management program. The monitoring of the insect flight activity using sex pheromone traps, under Takelsa open field plot, revealed that this insect developed up to three generations. The study of its population dynamics showed that on leaves, eggs and larvae are able to achieve two peaks. However, on fruits, only larvae were present in an important number and produced two generations. Pupae are almost absent in leaves and fruits. In this study, the management of this pest was performed through the chemical treatment by testing the efficacy of some insecticides. Two trials were tested on June, 2011. All tested insecticides were proved to be efficient in controlling H. armigera under field conditions.

TI  - Monitoring and mass trapping of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, by the use of pheromone baited traps in Kargil, Ladakh, India
AB  - This study was conducted in six major apple growing areas of the Kargil region during 2009 and 2010; pheromone traps were evaluated for the monitoring and mass trapping of the codling moth. Monitoring the population dynamics of Cydia pomonella in 2009 revealed that the first catch was observed on 21 May, the highest on 11 June, and the lowest on 13 August at all of the locations. The dynamics were similar, but the population was lower in 2010. Climatic variables were more or less similar in both of the years. So, effective monitoring for the codling moth is essential and was highest in Hardas and lowest in Gongma during 2009 and highest in Shilikchey and lowest in Poyen in 2010.

The population of E. vittela on Pharbani Kranti, wild and Arka Anamika varied from 1.4 to 10.7, 0.5 to 4.9 and 0.9 to 9.5 larvae per quadrant. It reached its peak on the 43rd, 39th, and 40th meteorological weeks on these cultivars, respectively. During the maximum population level, the maximum and minimum temperature before noon; relative humidity; and afternoon relative humidity were 31.9, 29.3 and 29.9C; 16.8, 21.3 and 20.3C; 51, 79 and 71%; and 33, 55 and 54%, respectively. The correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlation between larval population infesting Parbhani Kranti and Arka Anamika and maximum temperature, while it was non-significantly and positively correlated with maximum temperature on wild cultivar. The larval population in Parbhani Kranti was significantly and negatively correlated with afternoon relative humidity, while its correlation with afternoon relative humidity was non-significantly negative on wild cultivar and Arka Anamika. These results indicate that increase in maximum temperature and decrease in afternoon relative humidity increased the pest population.

TI  - Integrative taxonomy reveals six new species related to the Mediterranean corn stalk borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefbvre) (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae, Sesamiina)
AB  - Species in the stem borer noctuid subtribe Sesamiina are notoriously difficult to distinguish because most related species have homogeneous wing patterns and almost indistinguishable genitalia. The latter is potentially problematic because this group includes several important pest species that are usually barely distinguishable from non-pest species. In this study we focus on the Mediterranean corn stalk borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefbvre), an important pest of maize with a wide area of distribution that covers most of Africa and extends to the south of Europe and western Asia. According to a recent study, this pest consists of three allopatric populations that were formerly considered as distinct species or subspecies. Here we rely on recent collections of 5470 specimens (sampled in 17 countries and 175 localities) that putatively belong to S. nonagrioides. Integrative taxonomy studies allowed us to unravel the existence of six new species that are closely related to S. nonagrioides and described in this paper. In contrast to S. nonagrioides these new species have more specific ecological preferences, as they are associated with a limited number of plant species and habitats. Dating and population genetic analyses carried out on 100 S. nonagrioides specimens also indicate a more complex population structure than previously thought for S. nonagrioides, which can probably be accounted for by late Cenozoic environmental changes.

TI  - Beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) a newly emerging pest of Egyptian clover in Punjab
AB  - Studies on population dynamics of Thysanoplusia oricalcea, Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exigua were carried out on berseem. All the three lepidopterans were prevalent throughout the season but H. armigera population was negligible during February-March and increased in April. Mean larval population of T. oricalcea, S. exigua and H. armigera was 2.33, 0.88 and 1.13 larvae/m2 at PAU, Ludhiana and 0.83, 3.71 and 0.92 larvae/m2 at RRS, Gurdaspur. Investigation on biological characteristics along with molecular phylogeny of beet armyworm S. exigua were undertaken keeping in view presence of damaging population of pest on the berseem at two locations (Ludhiana and Gurdaspur) in Punjab. The study revealed that the average egg, larval, pupal, adult male and adult female period were 2.40.55, 18.61.7, 8.41.14, 6.80.8 and 7.60.9 days, respectively. The average life cycle was completed in 29.41.5 days and average fecundity was 241.230 eggs per female. On the basis of mitochondrial sequences, Ludhiana population of S. exigua was almost similar to all The Netherlands populations and one of the German populations.

TI  - "Studies on the effect of chloroform extract of Ocimum basilicum (family Lamiaceae) on the III and V instar larvae of silkmoth Bombyx mori (family Bombycidae)"
AB  - Plants are the richest source of organic chemicals on earth and phytochemicals have been reported to influence the life and performance of different insects. Various extract of medicinal plants have been tested by supplementation in the silkworm Bombyx mori (L) and were seen to influence the body weight, silk gland weight and the silk thread length in Bombyx mori. Almost all insects are host specific and select their most preferred food in order to extract the maximum benefit out of it, although most of them eat a great many varieties. Different food plants may influence differently the food intake, efficiency of digestion, conversion of food to body biomass and finally the growth and development of insect critically reviewed these aspects of nutrition and ecology of insect and concluded that nutritional indices as well as growth and development of insect varied on different host plants. Generally varieties of the some species may exert variable effect on the relative survival of herbivore insect. In recent years, attempts have been made in sericulture to study the effect of temperature, relative humidity, ecological factors, egg magnetization, cocoon refrigeration, cocoon magnetization, 20-hydroxyecdysone hormone and phytoecdysteroid hormone, on the performance of silkworm. The phytochemicals could benefit sericulture by improving the silk yield of B. mori and its commercial production. Man has benefited from the silk, produced by silkworm and subsequently researchers have always been trying to unveil the factors that can be manipulated to the benefit of the silkworm rearers. Spraying the leaf extract of Ocimum basilicum, are gaining importance because of their wide spectrum of biological action, novel mode of action and eco-friendly nature. In the present study of research work it was observed that the leaf extract of Ocimum basilicum proved to be a very effective on growth and maturation of silkmoth Bombyx mori L.

TI  - An annotated checklist of the Noctuoidea of Jordan with remarks on ecology, phenology and zoogeography. Part V Noctuinae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - A complete list of all known Noctuinae species of Jordan is presented and, the biogeography, phenology and distribution of the species is discussed. Within a German-Israeli project to monitor the Lepidoptera Fauna of the Levant we recorded from 1986 to 2010 a total of 44 species, three of which are new records for the country [Agrotis margelanoides (Boursin, 1944), Dichagyris leucomelas Brandt, 1941, Euxoa conspicua (Hbner, 1824)]. In Jordan the Noctuinae are represented by nine genera. Most of the recorded species belong to Agrotis (15), Dichagyris (11) and Euxoa (8); the majority of the species are of an Irano-Turanian (13), Palaearctic (11) and Eremic (11) distribution pattern. The majority of the Noctuinae are clearly concentrated within one or two vegetation zones, and only the two tropical, ubiquitous and polyphagous species (Agrotis ipsilon and Agrotis segetum) are distributed all over the country. In Jordan most of the Eremic species known from the Levant are found (11 of 12), whereas the Irano-Turanian (13 of 37) and the Mediterranean (5 of 19) elements of the same region are represented by much almost 1/3 and almost/respectively of the known species. Thirty-nine species are uni-voltine with the highest rate of occurrence in autumn from October to November; the other species are multi-voltine, flying at least twice - in spring and again later in autumn.

TI  - An annotated checklist of the Noctuoidea of Jordan with remarks on ecology, phenology and zoogeography. Part IV Hadeninae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - A complete list of the presently known Hadeninae of Jordan is presented, and the biogeography, phenology and distribution of the same are discussed. Within a German-Israeli project to monitor the Lepidoptera Fauna of the Levant we record from 1986 to 2010 a total of 39 species, ten of which (26%) are new records for the country. In Jordan four tribes of Hadeninae with 16 genera are found. Most of the recorded species belong to the Tribes Hadenini (22) and Leucanini (12), all of the species are of a Palaearctic (13) distribution, Eremic (9), Mediterranean (8) and Irano-Turanian (7) distribution pattern. Most of the Hadeninae are clearly concentrated within one vegetation zone, while only three ubiquitous and polyphagous species are distributed countrywide. In Jordan 75% of the Eremic species known from the Levant are found, while the Irano-Turanian and Mediterranean elements of the same region are represented only by about half, or even less of the known species. Twenty-four species are uni-voltine with the highest rate of occurrence in spring from March to April; only 2 species are autumnal, the other species are multi-voltine, flying at least twice a year, in spring and again later in autumn.

AB  - A complete list of the presently known species of Cuculliinae and Oncocnemidinae of Jordan is presented, and the biogeography, phenology and distribution of the same are discussed. Within a German-Israeli project to monitor the Lepidoptera Fauna of the Levant we recorded from 1986 to 2010 a total of eleven species of Cuculliinae and 28 species of Oncocnemidinae five of which species are new records for the country [Cucullia celsiae (Herrich-Schaffer, 1850), Cucullia oberthueri Culot, 1909, Brachygalea kalchbergi (Staudinger, 1897), Cleonymia warionis (Oberthr, 1876), Lithophasia quadrivirgula (Mabille, 1888)]. In Jordan the Cuculliinae are represented by one genera and the Oncocnemidinae by twelve genera. Most of the species clearly cluster within one vegetation zone. The majority of species are of an Eremic (19) and Irano-Turanian (10) distribution pattern, Mediterranean (9) and Palearctic (1) elements are uncommon. The bulk of the species is univoltine with the highest occurrence in spring from March to April and to a lesser extent in winter. Almost all the Eremic species of the Levant can be found in Jordan, while the Irano-Turanian and Mediterranean elements of the Levant are represented only by about half of the species.

TI  - The Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus - 10 years of commercial field use
AB  - In the last 15 years, extensive work on the Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (CrleGV) has been conducted in South Africa, initially in the laboratory, but subsequently also in the field. This culminated in the registration of the first CrleGV-based biopesticide in 2004 (hence, the 10 years of commercial use in the field) and the second one three years later. Since 2000, more than 50 field trials have been conducted with CrleGV against the false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta, on citrus in South Africa. In a representative sample of 13 field trials reported over this period, efficacy (measured by reduction in larval infestation of fruit) ranged between 30% and 92%. Efficacy was shown to persist at a level of 70% for up to 17 weeks after application of CrleGV. This only occurred where the virus was applied in blocks rather than to single trees. The addition of molasses substantially and sometimes significantly enhanced efficacy. It was also established that CrleGV should not be applied at less than ~21013 OBs per ha in order to avoid compromised efficacy. As CrleGV-based products were shown to be at least as effective as chemical alternatives, persistent and compatible with natural enemies, their use is recommended within an integrated program for control of T. leucotreta on citrus and other crops.

TI  - Adult population fluctuation of oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Lep. Tortricidae), in peach orchards of Canakkale, Turkey
AB  - The study was conducted in nine different peach orchards in Central district, Lapseki and Bayramic districts of anakkale Province. In this study, adult population change of Oriental fruit moth, (Grapholita molesta Busck, 1916, Lepidoptera Tortricidae) was determined with pheromone traps. At the end of the study it was observed that G. molesta is abundant in all sampling orchards in both two years. Even though adult emergence changes at different years, it was started at mid April and continued until the end of November. Four-five flight periods were determined at the months of April, June, July, August and October throughout the season. When adult population development curves were examined, it was determined that the pest could generate four-five generation per year related to daily temperature values of early spring. It was concluded that late cultivars would be more affected because of the high amounts of adults in August and September.

TI  - Courtship behavior of the castniid palm borer, Paysandisia archon potential roles of male scents and visual cues in a day-flying moth
AB  - The castniid palm borer, Paysandisia archon (Burmeister) (Lepidoptera Castniidae), is a South American moth that in the last ten years has become a major pest of palm trees in the Mediterranean region. Current knowledge on the reproductive behavior of this diurnal moth suggests the importance of both visual and chemical cues, in particular the production of a male pheromone emitted during a specific scratching behavior. Male-produced scents have diverse functions in lepidopteran sexual communication but generally act during courtship behavior, leading to complex, stereotyped courtship sequences. As a first step to understand the cues involved in mating behavior and the role of male scents in male mating success, we quantified sequences of P. archon courtship behavior using video filming. To distinguish behaviors leading to an approach of both partners from those involved in short-range courtship, sequences were divided into "approach" and "interaction" phases. Quantifications and analyses were first made by non-parametric ANOVA analysis of behavioral event frequencies, followed by flowchart construction using transition matrix probabilities. In 90% of the observations, courting activities led to copulation, but successful sequences were highly variable and could be divided into two categories, "rapid" and "prolonged" courtship sequences. In both categories, approaches were performed by males but depended strongly on female movements, especially on female flights. The significant behavioral differences were observed after the first contact (i.e., interaction phase) where, in rapid sequences, males generally acceded to copulation without displaying scratching behavior. Conversely, in prolonged sequences, the female expressed evading behavior and male scratching frequency increased. The possible roles of male scent emission in female mate choice and the importance of visual cues in the mating behavior of P. archon are discussed.

TI  - Investigating the performance of LEPIK machine for managing population density of spotted bollworm (Earias spp.) in cotton crop
AB  - Current study was conducted in two consecutive years i.e. 2013 and 2014 on cotton crop for evaluating the performance of LEPIK (Light Equipped Power Insect Killer) technology at three application intervals (3, 6 and 9 days) against spotted bollworm as compared to spinosad(chemical control measure) and control treatment. LEPIK technology applied at 3, 6 and 9 days interval exhibited population densities of spotted bollworm in the range of 1.89-1.95, 4.94-5.32, 6.89-7.91 larvae/plant in both years. The chemically treated plots showed a population density of less than 1.0 larvae/plant both years. The highest and statistically similar population reduction for Earias spp. was recorded in those plots which were treated with spinosad (95.9 and 97.5% in 2013 and 2014, respectively) and LEPIK technology applied at 3 days interval (84.3 and 86.0% in 2013 and 2014, respectively). The plots where LEPIK technology was applied at 6 and 9 days interval exhibited 55.6-58.8% and 29.1-31.1% reduction in spotted bollworm population in both years. LEPIK technology applied at 3, 6 and 9 days interval demonstrated 4.7-4.9, 14.1-15.1 and 19.9-20.9 times less reduction in the spotted bollworm population than spinosad in both years. The highest and statistically similar population reduction for Earias spp. (&gt;80% but &lt;100%) was recorded in those plots which were treated with spinosad and LEPIK technology applied at 3 days interval. In conclusion, the application of LEPIK technology at three days interval proved at par with chemical control but better than non-chemical control measure and hence can be recommended for spotted bollworm management after evaluating its cost of application and cost benefit ratio.

TI  - Corks damaged by Nemapogon granellus (L.) in Tuscan wine cellars (Italy)
AB  - European grain moth, Nemapogon granellus (L.), is cosmopolitan in the temperate regions of the world and includes indoor and outdoor populations. Larvae feed on cereals, soybeans, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts, bran, grass seeds, clovers, flax, ergot, dry fruits, chocolate, mushrooms, seeds, moldy cheese, prunes, chestnuts, garlic, decayed wood, lichens, tobacco and pharmaceutical products. Some authors have stressed the importance of N. granellus as a pest in wine cellars where larvae feed on, and tunnel into, the corks of wine bottles. This causes aesthetic damage to the corks, which must be replaced before delivery to consumers. When tunnels ultimately connect both ends of the cork, the wine itself is affected and bottles rejected due to alteration in the organoleptic properties of the wine. During 2011, heavy infestations of European grain moth occurred in some Italian wine cellars in Tuscany (Italy), causing serious damage on exposed wine-bottle corks. The infestation occurred on red wine bottles (approximately 9,000) stored for aging for over 20 years. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy was adopted, monitoring N. granellus adults with pheromone traps, accompanied by careful cleaning of the rooms, shelves and machinery, alternated to localized treatments using fogs with pyrethrum, and by the replacement of the infested corks. In addition, application of cellar sanitation procedures reduced the sources of pests as well as the possibility of insect reproduction, particularly in the areas of corks storage.

TI  - Control of European corn borer and cotton bollworm by airplane insecticide application. / Suzbijanje kukuruznog plamenca i kukuruzne sovice primenom insekticida iz aviona
AB  - In the recent period, the most significant corn pests, European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn) and Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hbn), have started to occur regularly and cause substantial damages, thus requiring several control measures to be employed in protection of this crop (rotation, sowing of tolerant or resistant hybrids, occurrence monitoring and forecast, as well as chemical control measures). The trial was set according to standard OEPP methods in Riica locality, on mercantile corn variety Pioneer K67. Insecticide product Avaunt 15-EC (indoxacarb 150 g/l) at rate 0.25 l/ha was applied by airplane. The size of experimental plot was 1 ha. The trial was set on 19th of August 2011 in four replicates, 12 days after maximum flight of adults. Three evaluations were performed the first was one day before the treatment, on 25 plants per replication, the number of egg masses, number of O. nubilalis and H. armigera larvae (on corn silk) and number of larvae tunelled in the upper part of the corn ear were determined. In the second evaluation (on 30th of August 2011) the number of damaged plants, ears and vital larvae were determined on 20 plants per replication. In third evaluation (on 4th of October 2010), just before harvest, the number of damaged plants (stem damage), broken plants above ear, broken plants below ear and the number of damaged ears were determined on 20 plants per replication. The results are shown through relative (%) and mean values, efficacy (E%) according to Abbott and significance of differences (LSD 5%). In experimental plot, the presence of egg masses of corn borer was recorded on 33-44% of plants, larvae on corn silk on 9-11% of plants and larvae tunelled in ears on 4-7% of plants. Larvae of H. armigera were registered on corn silk on 4-6% of plants and larvae tunelled in corn ear on 2-3% of plants. After 11 days from Avaunt 15-EC application, the number of damaged plants was 7.5% and on significantly lower level compared to control where 83.7% of damaged plants was recorded. Insecticide efficacy (number of vital larvae in corn stem and ear for both insect species) was 85.4-86.2%. Just before harvest, E% of the product Avaunt 15-EC (number of damaged and broken plants and number of damaged ears) was 82-100%.

TI  - Model predicts a future pine processionary moth risk in Artvin and adjacent regions
AB  - In recent decades, climate change has been receiving a lot of attention from researchers as it is believed to be proceeding at an extraordinary rate during the last 1,300 years and many studies have attempted to document and predict its environmental effects. Eastern winter pine processionary moth (PPM), Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae), an economically important pest of pines in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, distributed through almost all coastal regions within Turkey. Even though, its European sister species, T. pityocampa is known to be an aggressive invader under global warming in Europe and proved to expand its range towards northern latitudes; there is a lack of knowledge about species current and future status through Turkey, especially Artvin and adjacent regions (Eastern Black Sea Region) where it has not have much effect yet. In this study, we aimed to predict PPM's current and future distribution through Artvin and adjacent regions by using Maximum Entropy Modeling (Maxent) software. We used 65 sampling points in conjunction with 7 climatic variables that were least intercorrelated and with greatest significant contribution to the distribution model. As the statistical tests showed that the fit of the generated model is good, we further carried on using this model for future predictions. Our results indicated that PPM would expand its range towards Artvin and adjacent regions. Even though, currently this region is not under risk of PPM invasion, models suggest that future climatic conditions might trigger PPM invasion in near future - by 2050-2080.

TI  - Population dynamic of the cocoa stem borer, Eulophonotus myrmeleon Felder (Lepidoptera Cossidae) in the Haut-Sassandra region of Cte d'Ivoire. / Dynamique des populations du foreur des tiges du cacaoyer, Eulophonotus myrmeleon Felder (Lpidoptre Cossidae) dans la rgion du Haut-Sassandra en Cte d'Ivoire
AB  - Objective The cocoa stem borer, Eulophonotus myrmeleon Felder causes today serious damage in cocoa farm in Cte d'Ivoire. This study was conducted to determine the outbreak periods of this new lepidopteran pest in the Haut-Sassandra region, the second largest cocoa producing area in Cte d'Ivoire. Methodology and Results The study was conducted from 2009 to 2013 in farmers' cocoa farms in the Haut-Sassandra region in Cte d'Ivoire. Seasonal variation of the rate of Eulophonotus myrmeleon attacks were assessed by counting recent holes in six cocoa farms chosen in 3 counties with 2 farms in each county. Rainfall data were also collected during the same period. The results showed that there are two periods of severe attacks of E myrmeleon in the Haut-Sassandra region. These attacks occur from January to April with a peak in February and from June to November with a peak in August. During these outbreak periods, the larval population level is high in the cocoa farms, indicating intense larval activities in the farms. The results also showed that the level of attack increased from 2009 to 2013, indicating that this insect has become a serious problem for the farmers in this region. Rainfall seems to play a significant role in the breeding and population rise of these insects as periods of heavy attacks were observed after periods of rainfalls. Similarly, the lower temperatures seemed to favor an increase in Eulophonotus myrmeleon attack. Conclusion and applications The results obtained in this study could be very useful for recommending control measures against larvae or adults. Indeed, periods of heavy attacks and adult emergence could be taken into account for rational insecticide application against this pest.

TI  - The biological characteristics of Agriphila aeneociliella and methods for monitoring and managing this pest
AB  - Objectives In recent years, a new wheat insect pest has occurred in Laizhou (Shandong) and Zezhou (Shanxi), which has been identified as Agriphila aeneociliella. This paper seeks to determine its biological characteristics and provide a basis for population monitoring and management. Methods The biological characteristics of A. aeneociliella, including annual life history and habits of each life-stage, were studied by field investigation, net-room observation, pair feeding and adult light trapping. Results In the wheat planting area of the Huang-Huai-Hai plain, this insect pest has one generation annually. The larvae over-winter as 2-3 instar larvae from November to February, feed on wheat seedlings in March and April, live through summer as cocoons, in which old larvae diapause from May to August, until September when they pupate. From late September to early October, the adults emerge, mate and lay their eggs; the hatching young larvae are the overwintering form. The adults have phototaxis and are inclined to lay eggs in/on soil. The larvae prefer tender parts of plants and have a "spot-and-sheet" distribution in the field. The overwintering larvae have high cold resistance, but the dispausing cocoons can't survive water-logging. Conclusion Knowledge of the timing of adult emergence in autumn, the initial damage caused by larvae in early spring and the summer dispause are crucial for population monitoring and management of this insect pest.

TI  - On-farm evaluation of push-pull system for stem borers and striga management on sorghum in Northeastern Ethiopia
AB  - Stem borers and the weed Striga hermonthica (Delile) Benth are the key pests of sorghum in Ethiopia. On-farm trials were conducted in Gubalfto and Dawachefa districts of Amhara Regional State with the aim of evaluating alternate stem borers and Striga management systems in 2009 and 2010. The treatments were (1) mono sorghum (2) sorghum intercropped with Desmodium (3) two rows of Napier grass planted at edge of sorghum plots and (4) both intercropped Desmodium and two rows of Napier grass at the edge of sorghum plots (push pull system). Significant (P&lt;0.05) lower leaf damage and higher grain yields were recorded in push-pull system than the mono-sorghum plots and the other combinations. Leaf damage was reduced to 51-55% in mono sorghum and 9-12% in push pull system at Chefa in both years. Similarly, significant higher leaf damage was recorded in mono sorghum (60-76%) than the push pull system (7-10%) at Lenchedima. The same reduction trends in chaffy heads, exit holes and larvae were recorded in push pull system. The other combination with sorghum (Desmodium and Napier grass) showed significantly high reduction on damage parameters and increased grain yield as compared to the mono sorghum. Lower Striga counts were recorded in Desmodium intercropped sorghum plots than mono-sorghum and Napier grass planted at the edge. Significantly high grain yield (P&lt;0.05) was obtained in push pull system (40-47 qt/ha) as compared to the mono sorghum (24-26 qt/ha) in both locations and years. Grain yield advantages of 66-67% and 47-69% over mono sorghum were recorded in push pull system at Chefa and Lenchedima, respectively. In addition to sorghum grain yield advantages, high biomass yield of Napier grass and silver leaf were obtained for livestock feed. In conclusion, the push-pull system reduced stem borer, Striga damage, increased sorghum yield, sustained animal feed resources accessibility, increased soil fertility and reduced soil erosion. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use push pull system in sorghum based farming system of Northeastern Ethiopia.

TI  - Comparison of the trapping efficiencies of lures based on the sex pheromones of two fruit moth species and a combination of the sex pheromones of each species
AB  - Objectives To provide a scientific basis for the efficient monitoring and green control of fruit moths in fruit orchards and improve the monitoring and control efficiency of the sex pheromone carriers. Methods The trapping efficiencies of sex pheromone carriers of Grapholita molesta Busck and Carposina sasakii Matsumura were compared to that of a combination of the pheromones of both species in the field. A Y-tube olfactometer was used to compare the preferences of fruit moths for the pheromones of each species and the combined pheromone. Results The individual sex pheromones of G. molesta and C. sasakii and the combination pheromone all effectively trapped G. molesta with catches of 8 238.33, 1 451.67 and 8 321.67 (moth/trap), respectively. The catches of each species' pheromone and the combination pheromone varied with moth generations; the combined sex pheromone caught more of the first, second and third generations of G. molesta than the G. molesta sex pheromone, but the G. molesta sex pheromone caught more of the overwintering and fourth generation than the combined sex pheromone. C. sasakii sex pheromone caught the fewest G. molesta. G. molesta sex pheromone and the combined sex pheromone were used to monitor five population peaks of G. molesta. Dates of the peak periods were basically the same, but peak day catches with the combined sex pheromone were higher than those achieved with G. molesta sex pheromone. The C. sasakii sex pheromone was used to monitor three peak periods in each of which the peak days catches were lower than those achieved with the other two pheromone treatments. (2) C. sasakii sex pheromone and the combined sex pheromone could both capture C. sasakii with respective total catches of 4.00 and 2.33 (moth/trap), but the G. molesta sex pheromone was not effective at capturing C. sasakii. (3) Both G. molesta and C. sasakii sex pheromone, and the combined sex pheromone, attracted G. molesta in the Y-tube olfactometer test. The respective preferences of G. molesta for the above three treatments were 50.67%, 8.67% and 53.33%. Conclusion A combination of G. molesta and C. sasaki sex pheromone achieved a higher catch rate of G. molesta, but a lower catch rate of C. sasakii compared to the individual sex pheromones of each species, however, there was no significant difference between these three treatments. None of the treatments changed the population dynamics of G. molesta and C. sasakii. Therefore, a combination of the sex pheromones of G. molesta and C. sasaki should be used to monitor and control G. molesta and C. sasakii in peach orchard.

TI  - Systemic control of Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrana Scudder in Comstock, 1880) enhances seedling vigor, plantation establishment, and early stand-level productivity in Pinus taeda L
AB  - Establishment is a vulnerable and expensive stage of stand development in intensively managed pine plantations. We evaluated the capacity of establishing loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations to increase productivity by systemic control of Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrana Scudder in Comstock, 1880). In January 2009, four genotypes of improved genetics loblolly pine were planted in whole-plot treatments of herbaceous competition control at an upper coastal plain (UCP) site and phosphorus fertilization at a lower coastal plain (LCP) site, and split-plot treatments of tip moth control. Trees were monitored for tip moth infestation levels, vigor, survival, and stand-level biomass production for 2 years. During this time, tip moth infestation levels were very high at both sites, averaging 69% at UCP and 70% at LCP. However, levels averaged only 8% at UCP and 39% at LCP in treatments that included applications of systemic insecticides at planting. At LCP, biomass production averaged 2,159 kg ha-1 after 2 years. Protection from tip moth increased LCP biomass by 11% averaged across genotypes and 20-30% for the most responsive genotypes. At UCP, 2-year pine biomass production was much lower at 114.5 kg ha-1 and was increased 150% by protection from tip moth. At UCP, there was a strong effect of genetics whereby one genotype experienced very high mortality (mean of 30%) attributed to meteorological conditions of the establishment year; however, this was greatly decreased (17%) by protection from the interacting stress of tip moth damage. We conclude that systemic control of tip moth using imidacloprid soil tablets has the potential to greatly enhance pine plantation establishment success and early productivity in areas of heavy pest pressure, which may compound through stand development.

TI  - Research regarding the monitoring of the species Tortrix viridana L. within Pitesti forest district, Arges County
AB  - The green oak leaf roller (Tortrix viridana L.) is a very dangerous pest that causes the most frequent defoliation in deciduous stands. Monitoring is often used to survey the populations of green oak leaf roller. For adult stage, monitoring is done using pheromone traps of Atravir type. In case of Colibasi stationary sampling site, Arges County, the number of catches varied from year to year depending on the evolution of the registered climatic conditions. In 2013, the percentage of defoliation recorded in the six stationary sampling sites was 3% within Pitesti forest district.

TI  - Situation of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella and its parasitoids in the cauliflower fields of Tehran
AB  - Aims The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lep. Plutellidae) is one of the most important pests of cruciferous plants. Amongst the most important factors to reduce this pest population are parasitoids. The aim of present study was to Identify the parasitoids of the diamondback moth (DMB), computating the density of DBM stages and its parasitoids and their performance in different cauliflower fields of Tehran. Also the objective of this study was to elucidate the reactions of DBM parasitoids to host density. Correlation between different larval densities and parasitism rate of DBM parasitoids were calculated using a recall method in field conditions. Place and Duration of Study Place - Department of Plant protection, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Shahed university, Tehran, Iran. Duration - June, 2011 to November, 2012. Methodology Sampling was carried out every two weeks from late June until early November. From each field 20 plants were selected. All larval instars and pupae on each plant were collected, and were counted and recorded separately for each field. Also, collected DBM larvae and pupae were kept on the host plant under controlled conditions (605% RH, 272C and 14L10D photoperiod). In order to do recall of larval parasitoids, different densities of 5, 15, 25 and 35 larvae were placed on each plant. For each density five plants were considered as five replication. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data on numbers of DBM larvae and pupa in different regions as well as the mean number of parasitoids and parasitism rate. The means were compared at the 5% level of significance using the Duncan studentized range test. Results In all studied areas, the larvae, pupae and the total number of larvae and pupae were determined as 3.05, 2.26 and 7.54 (per plant), respectively. The percentage of parasitism by D. anurum, C. plutellae and O. sokolowskii in all regions and total parasitism by these three species were determines obtained as 12.67, 10.29, 13.27 and 36.23% per plant, respectively. Conclusion The number of larval and pupal stages based on unit density, was significantly different between all experimental regions and Shahed university station. The highest percentage of parasitism was caused by D. anurum in Tehran. Spraying did not reduce the DBM population in some fields in Tehran, but repeated spraying caused a reduction in the activity of the parasitoids of DBM.

TI  - Influence of environmental factors on population dynamics and infestation pattern of Leucinodes orbonalis in winter brinjal of Odisha
AB  - The population dynamics and infestation pattern of brinjal shoot and fruit borer (BSFB) Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee in relation to different environmental factors was studied during the winter seasons of 2009-10 and 2010-11 at Keonjhar, Odisha. The maximum adult activity was noticed during 50th and 7th SW in 2009-10 and during 48th and 7th SW in 2010-11, whereas, the highest larval population of BSFB was observed one week after the maximum adult activity in each case. The pest infestation on shoots started from the second fortnight of October in both the years and the peak shoot infestation was observed during 47th and 49th SW in 2009-10 and 2010-11, respectively. However, the peak infestation on flower buds and fruits occurred during 51st and 8th SW in 2009-10 and on 49th and 8th SW during 2010-11. From the correlation study it was observed that temperature factors exerted a positive influence and relative humidity had a negative effect on the population build up and infestation of the pest. The findings indicated that the abiotic factors temperature and relative humidity had maximum contribution towards the fluctuation in pest incidence and infestation.

TI  - Validation of an insect pest phenological model for the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn) in the Po Valley in Italy
AB  - The European corn borer (ECB) Ostrinia nubilalis Hb. is one of the most important insect pests of maize. The chemical treatment by means of self-powered spraying machines is the main strategy adopted in Northern Italy to control the pest. The success of the treatment mostly depends on the timing of its application. Phenological models can be successfully used for identifying the right application period for the treatments. The main objectives of this work were the validation of an existing ECB phenological model and evaluating its possible future use as a management tool in Northern Italy. Model accuracy was tested against data collected from traps placed in 26 collaborating maize farm fields in Northern Italy from 2010 to 2012. The ECB adult flight activity was monitored and the model was tested for its accuracy in simulating the occurrence of the first generation adult flight peak. The model resulted accurate in the explored conditions, unbiased (negligible tendency to overestimation), and it was able to explain 76% of variation. The model was able to predict the occurrence of the adult peak with an error of4.3 days (Root Mean Square Error). The observed level of error can be considered acceptable for effective chemical treatments.

TI  - Tuta absoluta Meyrick (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) a new threat to tomato production in sub-Saharan Africa
AB  - This paper aims to update the invasion status of the tomato leafminer, T. absoluta, in the main vegetable-producing area in Senegal. The results of an extensive survey carried out during the 2012-13 growing season on a set of 50 tomato fields located in three zones (South, Centre and North) of the Niayes area show that T. absoluta populations are already established across the main vegetable-producing area. Occurrence of T. absoluta was found in half of the monitored tomato fields, causing significant crop damage during the 2013 hot, dry season (from February to May). In this zone, four fields (out of 9 fields) were abandoned by growers as a result of T. absoluta crop damage. Presence of T. absoluta was also detected in the South and Centre zones on other crops such as aubergine (7/11 fields) and Ethiopian aubergine (Solanum aethiopicum; 3/9 fields).

TI  - Pheromone trap monitoring and fruit damage caused by Grapholita molesta in apple orchards under four different control programs
AB  - Pheromone trap monitoring and assessment of fruit damage caused by Grapholita molesta were carried out in apple orchards in Iwate Prefecture where apple pests were controlled by conventional methods, by mating disruption with supplementary insecticide spraying, by mating disruption without supplementary insecticide spraying, and without insecticide spraying. The seasonal occurrence of G. molesta adult males in pheromone traps showed three peaks, May, July, and mid-August to early September, and the insects caught were considered to come from overwintering, first- and second-generation adult males, respectively. Fruit infested with G. molesta was only found in the orchard without insecticide spraying from late August to October, and the damage was caused by the third-generation larvae of this pest.

AB  - The aim of the study was monitoring prevalence of corn smut and European corn borer on maize plants with "stay-green" genotype. Four cultivars bred by Syngenta Seeds were analyzed NK Cooler, Delitop, NK Gazelle and NK Ravello. A significant influence of thermal and humidity conditions during maize vegetation seasons on infestation of the examined agrophages was demonstrated. However, no significant differences were noted in susceptibility of the examined hybrids to infestation rate with Ustilago maydis and prevalence of Ostrinia nubilalis. A tendency was observed towards higher occurrence of European corn borer on cultivar NK Gazelle, and higher frequency of plants infested with U. maydis on cultivar NK Ravello, when compared to the mean value of the years.

TI  - Occurrence of moths with potential economic significance in Baka during 2012 and forecast for 2013. / Pojava leptira koji mogu biti ekonomski znaajni u Bakoj tokom 2012. I prognoza za 2013. godinu
AB  - We observed occurrence of moths in two localities Sombor and elarevo. Light trap type RO Agrobecej was used. Source of light was mercury bulb with 250 W powers. Over 130,000 individuals of moths were determined. Those individuals were classified into over 160 species. Higher number of individuals, in comparison to average values, was collected for species Beet Webworm, European Corn Borer, Silver Y Moth (only in Celarevo), Cotton Bollworm, Beet Armyworm (only in Celarevo), Cabbage Moth, Heart and Dart, Turnip Moth and Fall Webworm. Smaller number of individuals, in comparison to the average values, was notified for species Silver Y Moth (only in Sombor), Beet Armyworm (only in Sombor), Bright-line Brown Eye and Black Cutworm. In 2012 economic damages were caused by species European Corn Borer, Silver Y moth, Cotton Bollworm, Heart and Dart, Turnip Moth and Fall Webworm. For species Heart and Dart, Turnip Moth we expect increase of populations for 1st generations in 2013. Population numbers will be such that chemical control will be necessary on more susceptive grown plants. We predict decrease in populations of species Bright-line Brown Eye and Fall Webworm, therefore chemical control will be unnecessary. For species Beet Armyworm it is uncommon to develop long-term forecast, since the species is migratory, however it seems that the species is in high expansion and therefore the populations of this species should be intensively monitored in upcoming season.

TI  - Occurrence of cotton bollworm on organic produced sweet pepper and tomato in Subotica surroundings during 2012. / Dinamika po jave pamukove sovice na organski gajenoj paprici i paradajzu u okolini Subotice tokom 2012. godine
AB  - Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hbn.) is economically significant pest of fruit-bearing vegetables in Serbia for last 20 years. During 6 June-12 October 2012, population dynamics and abundance of H. armigera has been monitored on organic produced tomato and sweet pepper in Subotica vicinity. Male flight of H. armigera followed by pheromone trap in sweet pepper had two distinct peaks, in first decade of August and during 31 August 6 September. Apparentiy, sweet pepper was less attractive to this pest, because only 3.7 or 3.5 eggs per plant were found as mean values during two oviposition peaks, 11 August and 6 September. Often applied water cannon irrigation contributed to such low egg and larval density, as well as low fruit damage on sweet pepper (arround 15%). Cotton bollworm egg density was seven times higher on tomato. Maximal average number of laid eggs per plant were recorded during first half of August (22.2) and first half of September (24.8 eggs). Density of one to six caterpillars per plant (average values 1.5, 1.4 and 1.1), during three peaks (the end of July, August and September) caused damage of 25-40% on tomato fruits. In order to protect the vegetables in the organic production of cotton bollworm invasion such as recorded in the 2012, recommended repeated irrigation or application of repellents or other permitted means, between the start and the maximum flight of butterflies or at least between the beginning and the maximum oviposition, for each generation separately.

TI  - Typhlodromus pyri (Phytoseiidae) - research and implementation in IPM of fruit orchards and vineyards in the Czech Republic
AB  - A simple shake-and wash technique for monitoring mites was developed. A faunal survey documented twenty-five species of phytoseiids. Typhlodromus pyri was abundant only in some of commercial sprayed orchards and vineyards, or was absent. The residual leaf-dip tests indicated considerable differences in susceptibility of T. pyri strains to azinphos-ethyl (Gusathion A). Local resistant populations of T. pyri were revealed. The seasonal history of T. pyri was described and data on population dynamics, number of generations, feeding, mating and reproductive habits as well as seasonal distribution within the apple tree canopy were collected. It was documented that communities of predatory phytoseiid mites and spider and eriophyid mites were influenced by specific type of chemical treatment. The long-term residual efficacy of 16 pesticides to the predatory phytoseiid mite T. pyri was evaluated in laboratory bioassays. Consequently specific spraying program against noxious tortricid moths and fungi in orchards and vineyards was set up to be compatible with T. pyri. A residual leaf-dip test proved a different innate susceptibility of susceptible and resistant strains of T. pyri, Euseius finlandicus, and Phytoseius echinus to azinphos-ethyl. E. finlandicus was the most susceptible whereas a susceptible strain of T. pyri the most tolerant. Esterase and glutathione S-transferase activities gave a good correlation between susceptibilities of these strains to azinphos-ethyl and activities of glutathione S-transferases. In summer, resistant populations of T. pyri were transfered to the predatory mite-free vineyards and orchards on one-yr shoots of apple or vine whereas in winter textile carrier strips with hibernating females were used. Life tables of overwintered females and their progeny of T. pyri fed on Tetranychus urticae and Cecidophyopsis ribis were constructed. Also powdery mildew affected parameters of development and proved to be important alternative food for T. pyri.

TI  - Determination and population fluctuations of harmful Archips (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) species on apple trees and the biology of important species Archips rosana (L., 1758) in Erzincan province. / Erzincan ilinde elma agaclarnda zarar yapan Archips (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) trlerinin tespiti, poplasyon degisimleri ile nemli tr Archips rosana (L., 1758)'nn biyolojisi
AB  - In this study conducted under laboratory and field conditions in Erzincan province in 2010-2011, the important species of leaf roller (Archips spp.) causing loss of crops and quality in the apple trees were identified, population fluctuations were appeared and biology of Archips rosana, important species, was determined. The orchards determined in the Central and zml districts of Erzincan were visited once a week and the eggs, larvae and pupae periods of pest on apple tree were determined and monitored. Pherocon-type traps were hung on the branches of apple trees in survey orchards for observing the changes of adult period. The species of leaf rollers, Archips podana (Scopoli, 1763), A. rosana (L., 1758) and Archips xylosteana (L., 1758) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in the apple orchards in the Erzincan were determined. Among these three species, A. rosana was found to be more intensive and determined to be an important species. The eggs of A. rosana were hatched 295-323 days in nature and average 312 days of its life cycles were spent in period of eggs. Also, as total larvae period of A. rosana was 59-77 days, pupae period was 36-41 days. After 17-23 days from first pupae appeared the exits of adults were recorded. Archips rosana had one generation in a year under Erzincan ecological conditions in 2010 and 2011.

TI  - Cutworms of Egypt 3-the biology of Agrotis spinifera (Hubner) (Noctuidae Lepidoptera)
AB  - In Egypt, cutworms from family Noctuidae and order Lepidoptera are serious polyphagous pests. Agrotis ipsilon (Hufn.) is the most abundant cutworm species followed by Agrotis spinifera (Hubner). Locally, plenty of research has been done on A. ipsilon while very little is known about A. spinifera. This article aimed at adding new contributions to the knowledge on the biology of A. spinifera. Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrenum L.) was the most favorable host plant for rearing the larvae of the pest, and a technique to maintain a laboratory stock culture of it is described. Under laboratory conditions, A. spinifera had 3 complete and a 4th. partial overlapping annual generations. The 1st. (winter) generation took place from early-November until early-March, and lasted for 102-113 days. The 2nd. (early spring) generation occurred between mid-February and late-April, and lasted for 45-59 days. The 3rd. (late spring) generation elapsed the period from mid-April until mid-June, and lasted for 56-62 days. The partial 4th. (summer) generation occurred between early-June and late-September, with a mean duration of about 88 days. The durations of the egg, larval (with 6 instars), female pupal. male pupal, female adult and male adult stages were 4-15, 27-82, 8-17, 10-19, 2-12 and 2-13 days, respectively. Pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition periods of mated female moths ranged 1-7, 1-10 and 0-2 days, respectively. Egg-laying capacity ranged 0-1421 eggs/mated female. The total life-cycle was completed in 53-113 days in female individuals and 53-111 days in male individuals.

TI  - Efficacy of the auto-confusion system for mating disruption of Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) and Plodia interpunctella (Hbner)
AB  - The auto-confusion system for stored-product pyralid moths, based on the contamination of adult males with the sex female pheromone (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate (commercially known as TDA or ZETA), was evaluated. For this purpose, we applied Exosex SPTab dispensers that contained the EntostatTM powder, at a 55 m grid, in three facilities, one feed mill in Italy and two retail stores in Greece. In the feed mill, the most abundant pyralid species was Ephestia kuehniella. Monitoring through pheromone-baited traps in this facility indicated that the application of the Exosex SPTab dispensers decreased the number of captures 2 months after the initial application. In the case of the facilities in Greece, the most abundant species was Plodia interpunctella. In these facilities there was a continuous monitoring of moth populations from January 2008 until February 2011, with pheromone-baited traps and Petri dishes with semolina, which served as oviposition traps. In both facilities, the presence of P. interpunctella males in the pheromone-baited traps was reduced after the placement of the Exosex SPTab dispensers, in comparison to captures for the same interval from the previous years. At the same time, the number of emerging individuals in the oviposition traps was notably reduced after the Exosex SPTab dispensers placement, in comparison to the previous monitoring interval. Our study documents that the auto-confusion system is an effective and reliable technique that can be used with success against stored-product Pyralidae, to retail stores and feed mills.

TI  - Remarkable records of Macrolepidoptera in Sweden 2012. / Intressanta fynd av storfjrilar (Macrolepidoptera) i Sverige 2012
AB  - This is the 40th consecutive annual report on interesting finds and provincial records of Macrolepidoptera in Sweden. The season 2012 was on average rather wet in most parts of Sweden even though the temperatures were not below normal most of the time. On the other hand there were also relatively few periods with temperatures above normal. Presumably due to the somewhat gloomy weather the number of records was less impressive than previous years, even though by pre-global warming standards the number of finds is still striking. One Macrolepidoptera species was recorded for the first time in Sweden during 2012 the South European Noctuid moth Bryophila ravula which was found in western Sweden. It was a surprising record since this species does not occur in any of our neighbouring countries. The newcomer from last year, Apatura ilia showed up also in 2012 even though in lower number than anticipated, when considering the numbers occurring at the same time in southern Finland. The most striking migration in 2012 was the massive influx of Nymphalis xanthomelas to NW Europe, which was the largest ever recorded. The butterflies started to appear in the beginning of July in the SE parts of Sweden and gradually spread towards west and more inland. There were observations made of Nymphalis xanthomelas until beginning of October and all together more than 140 observations have been reported. Other interesting observations were Eupithecia selinata, E. cauchiata, Pachycnemia hippocastanaria, Hyles euphorbiae, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, Thaumetopoea processionea, Herminia tarsicrinalis, Cryphia algae, Calyptra thalictri, Ephesia fulminea, Hydraecia ultima, Blepharita arnica, Noctua interposita, Xestia atrata, X. ditrapezium, Protoschinia scutosa and Heliothis viriplaca. Some of the above species are newcomers, which now may have resident populations descending from earlier migration activities. In other cases it is more likely that the observations during 2012 are mainly due to migration. One of the more frequent migrant species during the past decade, Agrius convolvuli, was again scarce in Sweden this year. Altogether 1112 Macrolepidoptera species have now been found in Sweden of which 14 are considered as introduced. The classification is according to Svensson et al. (1994) with minor corrections following Karsholt & Razowski (1996).

TI  - Pyralidae Phycitinae in Italian vineyards behavioural and molecular genetic investigations
AB  - In the last four years, during several surveys carried out in different wine growing areas of Veneto and Tuscany regions (Northern and Central Italy) for the monitoring and control of the tortricid moths Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermller), Eupoecilia ambiguella (Hbner) and Argyrotaenia ljungiana (Thunberg), larvae of Pyralidae Phycitinae have been frequently found within the clusters, mainly after veraison. Samples of these larvae were used for laboratory observations and reared to obtain the moths. Moreover, in order to collect field adults, pheromone sticky traps were installed in some vineyards. A randomized amount of the samples was then utilized for molecular analysis. A fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I (Barcode) was chosen for the sequencing. The identity of the species was verified using the on-line databases BOLDSYSTEM and GenBank (NCBI). A total of 32 larvae and 28 adults (obtained from both reared larvae and sticky traps) were processed, and sequences of approximately 610bp were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis of the collected phycitins revealed the existence of 5 groups. The members of the first group present a homology of 99-100% with Ephestia unicolorella woodiella Richard & Thomson. In both regions this species resulted the predominant phycitin collected in the clusters. A similarity of 100% with Ephestia elutella (Hbner) was found for the members of the second group, all collected in Veneto vineyards with pheromone sticky traps, with the exception of one larva. The third group coincides with Cryptoblabes gnidiella (Millire). This species was only found in Tuscany, where it is the most frequent phycitin observed in the coastal vineyards. The fourth group, including the 24% of the phycitin larvae collected in Veneto, shows a similarity of 99-100% with Ectomyelois (=Apomyelois) ceratoniae (Zeller). For the members of the last group, collected in the pheromone sticky traps exposed in Veneto, no correspondence was found in the GenBank and the morphological identification is still in progress. Results of this research, still ongoing, constitute a significant contribution to the characterisation of the phycitin population inhabiting the grape clusters during ripening in several important areas of our Country.

TI  - The development in the occurrence of the Convolvulus Hawk-moth (Agrius convolvuli (Linnaeus, 1758)) in Denmark in the period 1961-2011. / En analyse af udviklingen i f orekomsten af snerlesvrmer (Agrius convolvuli L.) i Danmark 1961-2011
AB  - The development in the occurrence of the Convolvulus Hawk-moth (Agrius convolvuli (Linnaeus, 1758)) in Denmark in the period 1961-2011 is analyzed according to three potential causes * Increasing intensity in collecting due to the development in the use of automatic light-traps. * Changes in the geography of collecting. * Climate change. The analysis shows that from 1961 until the early 1990s A. convolvuli has not become more abundant in Denmark. In this period the prime cause of the increased number of specimens recorded has been the result of a very strong increase in the use of automatic light-traps. A change in the collecting geography may have been a supplementary cause during the 1980s. Since the early 1990s the development in the use of automatic light-traps is still an important factor regarding the development in the number of recorded specimens. Climate change has however played a major role as explanatory factor from the early 1990s to 2011 and it is estimated that in this period the abundance of A. convolvuli has increased by 200 to 300% due to climate change.

TI  - Spread and impacts of the Agapanthus borer (Neuranethes spodopterodes (Hampson, 1908), comb. nov.), a translocated native moth species (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - In the summer of 2010-11, a highly destructive moth species was observed feeding on and damaging cultivated A. praecox. The feeding damage affected all parts of the plants, culminating in partial or total destruction of the rhizome, and extensive loss of inflorescences, to the extent that flowering was almost totally inhibited. Adult moths were reared from three localities (1) the base of an Agapanthus plant in Bristle Cone Nursery in Skeerport, North West Province (November 2010), (2) from A. praecox in Constantia, Cape Town (January 2011), and (3) from a plant in a nursery in Centurion, Gauteng (2012). These larvae were subsequently reared and identified as N. spodopterodes. A survey of the occurrence and spread of N. spodopterodes in South Africa was conducted from March to October 2012. N. spodopterodes was detected in Western Cape, Cape Town, Mpumulanga, Western Cape, Gauteng and Kwazulu-Natal. A. praecox, A. inapertus and hybrids were infested by the borer. The rapid spread of N. spodopterodes across South Africa and its ability to feed on most species and varieties of Agapanthus suggest that it might be an effective biological control agent for the invasive A. praecox. The life history of N. spodopterodes is described.

(Lepidoptera Tortricidae)]'nun populasyon gelisimi ve farkl metotlar kullanlarak bulasklk orannn belirlenmesi
AB  - This study was conducted in 2 apple orchards in gtc and Kargl villages in Sanlurfa province during 2010 and 2011. In this study, we intended to determine some important criterias for the management of the codling moth [Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lep. Tortricidae)] in Sanlurfa, such as adult emergence time, adult population abundance, adult population peaks, adult activity duration in the nature and infestation rates. Population development of C. pomonella was monitored by sex pheromone traps. Three different methods; 'Tree-Based', 'Fruit-Based' and 'Crate-Based', were used to determine the codling moth infestation rates. Results of this study showed that adult flight began in last week of April and in beginning of May. Adult populations peaked 4 times in May, June, July and September throughout the season in both years. Adults were not caught in pheromone traps after second-half of September in both years. Codling moth adults were active in the nature at least 5 months from beginning of May to end of September.

TI  - Prediction of population dynamics of the grape berry moth Eupoecilia ambiguella and the European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana using the simulation model "Twickler"
AB  - The grape berry moth and European grapevine moth are the key pests of viticulture in Europe. The control commonly relies on insecticide treatments, at least outside of areas, where mating disruption is applied. Using the simulation model "Twickler" the effectiveness of insecticide treatments should be enhanced by combining data from weather stations with data from population dynamics of earlier years that end up in forecasts concerning important biological stages of the grape moths. The "Twickler" model was tested using datasets of population dynamics from several Franconian vineyards (Germany). The model simulates the population development of E. ambiguella and L. botrana and predicts the start of flight occurrence, beginning of oviposition and first larvae-hatching. These modelled information coincided well with corresponding data monitored in the vineyards. Twickler predicts the beginning of egg deposition and larvae hatching earlier than found in reality, indicating some deviance with respect to the underlying biology of the moths. Nevertheless it is seen as an advantage especially for extension services, since there would be enough time to release warnings to vine-farmers. This enables the farmer to apply insecticides at the right time and achieve a maximum efficacy and thus protect natural resources. Yet there are some technical problems that need to be solved, hence further investigations are suggested to confirm these results.

TI  - The Box-tree pyralid (Cydalima perspectalis) in the Box-tree forest of Grenzach-Whylen. / Der Buchsbaum-Znsler (Cydalima perspectalis) im Grenzach-Wyhlener Buchswald - Invasionschronik und Monitoringergebnisse
AB  - The Box-tree pyralid (Cydalima perspectalis) is originally native in East Asia. Its introduction into Europe (Weil am Rhein, Southwest Germany) occurred probably in the year 2007 by trade of plants for planting. Since its first evidence a lot of further confirmations have been emerged e.g. for Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Austria, Liechtenstein, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Belgium and Turkey. The yearly spread of the moth in the region of Basel (Switzerland) is about 5 km (FAZ). In conjunction with a contemporaneous invasion by the likewise new fungus Cylindrocladium buxicola infestation of the hundreds of years old Box-tree forest near Grenzach-Whylen led to total skeletonizing in 2010. Apart from the invasion chronicle this paper contains the results of the Box-tree pyralid monitoring since the year 2010.

TI  - Seasonal occurrence of apple heliodinid moth (Stathmopoda auriferella) and its control by environmentally-friendly measures in organic kiwifruit orchard
AB  - Apple heliodinid moth (AHM, Stathmopoda auriferella) is one of the most serious pests in organic kiwifruit orchards in Korea. Several organic cultural practices (light trapping, natural plant extracts, fruit bagging and fruit thinning) were applied for the control of AHM in commercial organic kiwifruit orchards in Haenam at the south-west end of the Korean peninsula. Flight peaks of the adult AHM population were observed twice a year, in early to mid-June and early to mid-August. These seasonal occurrences determined timing of control measures (May-September). Fruit damage caused by AHM differed significantly between green (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward') (48.2%) and gold (A. chinensis 'Haegeum') (9.8%) kiwifruit. Comparisons of light traps showed that a bluish-black light attracted 27.8 to 53.8% more AHM adults and resulted in 8.5% less fruit damage compared with a whitish-orange light in a 'Hayward' orchard trial. Some formulas of natural plant extracts provided good control of AHM. Among them, three formulas from Sophora flavescens, Cinnamomum cassia and Azadirachta indica, and a BT liquid showed over 80% control in field trials. Early fruit bagging and thinning right after fruit set were also effective on the reduction of the kiwifruit damage by AHM.

TI  - Variation in yield of paddy rice cultivated for 17 successive years using Chinese milkvetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) as green manure and its causal factors
AB  - The effects of green manure fertilization (Chinese milkvetch) and pesticide application on the grain yield of early maturing rice variety were examined for 17 successive years in the paddy field of Shizuoka University. Green manure without pesticide (only weeds were removed with a weeder and by hand; GM) were applied from 1993 to 2009, green manure and pesticide (GMP) from 1999 to 2009, chemical fertilizer and pesticide (CFP) from 1993 to 2009. According to weather fluctuation and the damage by rice stem borer from 1993 to 2000, the average rice grain yield in the GM plot during tins period was 409 g m-2, while that during the nine years after 2001 was 466 g m-2, which was the same as that in the GMP plot (468 g m-2). On the other hand, the average rice grain yield in the CFP plot was 517 g m-2 from 1993 to 2000 and 539 g m-2 after 2001. The biomass yield of Chinese milkvetch was decreased by the feeding by the exotic insect in the GMP and GM plot in 2006, 2007 and 2009. Thus, the average biomass yield in the GM plot during those three years was 414 g m-2, although that in the other years was 493 g m-2 which was 93% of that in the CFP plot. A close positive correlation was observed between the amount of Chinese milkvetch applied and the rice grain yield. Therefore, the effect of the application of Chinese milkvetch was retarding of early growth of rice.

TI  - Presence of entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria in Latvian population of horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella
AB  - In the last 20 years horse-chestnut leaf miner has become widespread in Europe, causing defoliation of horse-chestnut trees. The first record of horse-chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) in Latvia was made in summer 2002. In recent years C. ohridella has spread across all territory of Latvia. The aim of the study was to acquire preliminary data on mortality factors of horse-chestnut leaf miner C. ohridella and identify present entomopathogenic microorganisms. Causes of mortality of C. ohridella larvae and pupae in two sampling plots since 2010 were analysed. The developmental stage of larvae was noted and if the insect was dead, the mortality factor was referred to one of the categories parasitism, bacteria, fungi or another cause. Specimens with symptoms of infection (reduced movement, changes of colour, cuticle covered with fungal mycelia or conidia) were used for pathogen isolation. Total mortality rate of C. ohridella larval stages, including spinning stages and pupae, was 16.1%-47.1%. Eleven species of entomopathogenic fungi were isolated from collected dead specimens. Isolated and identified fungi belong to six genera Aspergillus; Hirsutella; Beauveria; Metarhizium; Lecanicillium and Isaria. The fungi from genera Hirsutella, Lecanicillium and Metarhizium were isolated from lepidopteran pest for the first time in Latvia. We have identified bacteria, associated with field-collected larvae of C. ohridella. The results suggest that bacterial diversity of the surface of C. ohridella larvae was relatively simple - it consisted of six bacteria species and were dominated by gamma proteobacteria class bacteria.

TI  - Eucosma scorzonerana - developmental biology, ecology, distribution and population status in Sweden. / Svinrotvecklaren Eucosma scorzonerana - utvecklingsbiologi, ekologi, utbredning och populationsstatus i Sverige
AB  - The moth Eucosma scorzonerna was described by Benander, 1942 and he suggested that Scorzonera humils was the foodplant. In an action plan for conservation of Microlepidoptera in Sweden the moth was studied and the early stages are now described. The whitish egg is put on the stem just above the ground and the larva is living in the flower head of Scorzonera humilis. It is dirty yellowish-brown with brown head, about 10 mm full-grown. The development takes 2-3 weeks. Then the larva leave the flower head and make a thin silken cocoon covered with detritus on the ground. The larva hibernates in the cocoon until the next spring and the pupation then occurs in the cocoon. The habitat is mowed meadows and semi-natural grasslands traditionally used for long times. In the middle and north parts of Gotland the species also occurs in sparse pinewoods with rich vegetation on limestone bedrock, at the ends of the woods and in glades. The flight-time begins in the last week of May and goes on for about 2-3 weeks mostly in the evening. The species is listed as vulnerable (VU) in Sweden. The dramatically change of land use reducing the habitats, isolation and declining fragmented populations and overgrowth caused by fertilizers and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are reasons for the declining status of the species. The increase and expansion of boar reaching now the only known site in the mainland, called lvhyttengen in the province Vstmanland, where the species is the most abundant in Sweden, is a new threat to the species because the boar willingly eats the roots of the foodplant. Now that mowed meadow is protected by electrified wires.

TI  - Influence of rubber trees on leaf-miner damage to coffee plants in an agroforestry system
AB  - The coffee leaf-miner (CLM) (Leucoptera coffeella Gurin-Mneville; Lepidoptera Lyonetiidae), the main pest of coffee plants, occurs widely throughout the Neotropics where it has a significant, negative economic and quantitative impact on coffee production. This study was conducted in a rubber tree/coffee plant interface that was influenced by the trees to a varying degrees depending on the location of the coffee plants, i.e. from beneath the rubber trees, extending through a range of distances from the edge of the tree plantation to end in a coffee monocrop field. The most severe damage inflicted on coffee plants by the CLM (number of mined leaves) from April, which marks the start of the water deficit period, until September 2003 was in the zone close to the rubber trees, whereas the damage inflicted on plants in the monocropped field was comparable to that on coffee plants grown directly beneath the rubber trees, which received about 25-40% of the available irradiance (Ir - available irradiation at a certain position divided by the irradiation received in full sunlight, i.e. in the monocrop). From May until July damage caused by the CLM nearly doubled in each month. In midwinter (July), the damage decreased perceptibly from the tree edge toward the open field. From September onward, with the rising air temperatures CLM damage in the coffee monocrop started to increase. Based on these results, we conclude that coffee plants grown in the full sun incurred the most damage only at the end of winter, with warming air temperatures. Coffee plants grown in shadier locations (25-40% Ir) were less damaged by the CLM, although a higher proportion of their leaves were mined. The rubber trees probably acted as a shelter during the cold autumn and winter seasons, leading to greater CLM damage over a distance outside the rubber tree plantation that was about equal to the height of the trees. Future studies should attempt to relate leaf hydric potential to pest attack in field conditions. More rigorous measurements of shade conditions could improve our understanding of the relationship of this factor to CLM attack.

TI  - Remarkable records of Microlepidoptera in Sweden during 2012. / Anmrkningsvrda fynd av smfjrilar (Microlepidoptera) i Sverige 2012
AB  - This is the 40th annual presentation of remarkable records of Microlepidoptera in Sweden. The weather during 2012 was very unfavourable and only occasional migrations were observed. So far 1740 species of Microlepidoptera are recorded from Sweden. One specimen, believed to represent an undescribed species of the genus Incurvaria (see Svensson 2009), has shown to be an aberration of I. oehlmanniella (Hbner, 1796). However, five species are recorded new to the indigenous fauna of Sweden but three of them are the result of identifying sibling species. Argyresthia svenssoni Bengtsson & Johansson, 2011, a northern species easy to confuse with A. glabratella (Zeller, 1847), was not included in the report from the last year and therefore presented here for the first time in this series of annual reports. Phalonidia udana Guenee, 1845 was earlier regarded a synonym of P. manniana (Fischer von Rslerstam, 1839) but recently distinguished as a good species (Mutanen et al. 2012a). It seems to be widespread over the whole of Sweden, yet, still with gaps. Epinotia cinereana (Haworth, 1811) was separated from E. nisella (Clerck, 1759) (Mutanen et al. 2012b), both probably occurring in the most of Sweden. In the province of Halland in the southwest of Sweden Nemophora congruella (Zeller, 1839) was discovered new to Sweden and is assumed to be a newcomer. Finally, on the island of Gotland, Bucculatrix ulmifoliae (M. Hering, 1931) was first revealed by the mines of larvae already in 2010 and two specimens hatched from these. It was during 2012 confirmed to be a habitant in the place. Stenoptilia pneumonanthes (Buttner, 1880) has been considered extinct from Sweden (Gardenfors ed. 2010) but photographs were unexpectedly taken already in 2009 of an adult moth and some eggs of this plume moth, but no voucher specimen was kept. In 2012 the occurrence was definitely verified by collecting a few specimens. The habitat was a shore bog at a small lake in the province of Smaland. The host of the larva, Gentiana pneumonanthe, was growing at the location. Cacoecimorpha pronubana (Hbner, 1799) [1019a] was found indoors in Stockholm but considered introduced. This was the first record from Sweden.

TI  - Performance of a wine trap device to monitor Lobesia botrana adult populations in Murcia vineyards
AB  - The food traps have had a considerable importance in the monitoring of Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermller) since the early decades of the last Century. The bait for these traps consisted of juices of various kinds such as vinegar, sugar, molasses, fruit juices, cider, and beer. Trapping females with these devices is considered a valuable tool to predict the onset of oviposition, essential to properly time pesticide treatments. With the identification of the sex pheromone and its use in monitoring traps, the studies aimed at the development of food traps were significantly reduced. However, in the wine-growing areas in which L. botrana is managed by using the mating disruption technique, the need for food traps and/or other valid tools to monitor adult population has become more and more urgent. In the district of Murcia (Spain), some investigations have been conducted in the last three years (2008-2011) to assess the validity of a wine trap device to capture L. botrana males and females. This device consists of a conical terra-cotta flower pot (upper diameter 15 cm; height 20 cm) surmounted by a circular disc positioned 10 cm over the rim. The trap is filled to the brim with a water-alcoholic solution consisting of 50% red wine (variety "Monastrell"), fixed to a pole just above the level of the clusters and checked every 3-4 days for adults counting and pot refilling. In the three years the monitoring activity has been carried out in vineyards of the red variety "Monastrell" in Yecla (Murcia) from April to October. In such context the captures obtained in wine traps have been compared with the captures obtained in pheromone traps, both in mating disrupted and in notmating disrupted vineyards. In 2010, adults caught in wine traps have been properly sexed and the females dissected to check the mating status. Very intriguing outcomes have emerged from the survey both in terms of number and timing of catches and in terms of the mating status of the females collected in the wine traps.

TI  - Distribution and population fluctuation of Grapholita molesta Busck, 1916, [(Lepidoptera Tortricidae)] in fruit orchards of Canakkale province. / Canakkale ili meyve alanlarnda Grapholita molesta Busck, 1916, (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)'nn yayls ve ergin poplasyon degisimi
AB  - This study was conducted to determine distribution and population fluctuation of Grapholita molesta Busck, 1916 (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in fruit production areas of Canakkale province in 2007-2009, by using pheromone traps. G. molesta adults were present in all sampled fruit orchards of Canakkale province. The adult population change was investigated by weekly samplings in three peach orchards in Center and Lapseki district. Depending on the sampling orchards, first adult flight of G. molesta started from the middle of March and continued until the middle of November. The flight curves showed that adult population produced 4 to 5 flight periods, which were in the middle of April, at the beginning of June, in the middle of July and August, and the end of October depending on orchards. As a result, it is determined that G. molesta had four generations per year in Canakkale Province.

TI  - Researches on wine moths flight captured on pheromone traps
AB  - The forecasting and warning system in Romania started with a control programmes applied against Plasmopara viticola, the most important pathogen of grapevine. Since then, studies and new techniques have been developed and applied to other important pests of vineyards, including Lobesia botrana and Eupoecilia ambiguella, different models have been evaluated as an important part of the control strategy, field monitoring using pheromones traps is used to formulate warnings that are sent out to farmers about the need to spray or not. Our research were done in village Fantanele, county Prahova situated on the "wine road" which capitalize famous "Dealul Mare" vineyard. The biology (flight curves of moths) of Lobesia botrana (grape vine moth), Eupoecilia ambiguella (European grape vine moth) was monitored in vineyard, in 2010-2011 using a sex pheromone traps, with a view to forecasting the damage rate and determining the best time to apply insecticides. Our data confirm that grape vine moth has 2-3 annual generations the moths appear from the end April until the end May flights spread over 2 to 3 weeks, the second flight takes place end of June-July and the third flight occurs in August-September, in the same time European grape vine moth has 2 annual generations, the moths arising from over wintered pupae appear at variable dates depending on year, the second flight takes place 2 to 2.5 months after the first. Data obtained confirm previous information's that before the 1st chemical application against adults, the peak of the flight curve should have been reached, for 1st flight the flower buds should be formed, and the pests' infestation rate in the vineyard should be at least 20%. For the 2nd application, at least one flight peak should have occurred, the grapes should be the size of peas and the infestation rate should be 1%. Sexpheromone trapping have been used in determination of critical biological stages of these pests. Generally a total of 2-3 treatments used to be applied against these pests but, using a proper warning system based on counting of captures from pheromone traps the number of chemical treatments could be reduced to 1.

TI  - Effects of larval density on food utilization efficiency and digestive enzyme activity of the beet webworm, Loxostege sticticalis (Lepidoptera Pyralidae)
AB  - To understand the larval feeding pattern of the outbreak population, Loxostege sticticalis, the variation of larval food utilization parameters and digestive enzyme activity of L. sticticalis among three larval densities (1, 10 and 30 larvae/jar of 650 mL) were studied in the laboratory (221C, 70% RH). The results showed that the highest and lowest midgut relative mass was found in the larvae reared at the density of 10 larvae per jar and 1 larva per jar, respectively. Larval relative consumption rate and excretion dry weight increased, but body weight and the efficiency of conversation of ingested food (ECI) declined as larval density rose. The relative consumption rate and dry weight of excretion of larvae reared at the density of 30 larvae per jar was significantly higher than that of larvae reared at the density of 1 larva per jar and 10 larvae per jar, while the ECI of larvae reared at the density of 30 larvae per jar was significantly lower than that of larvae reared at the density of 1 larva per jar. The approximate digestibility (AD) was significantly declined with increasing larval density. Furthermore, larval density had a significant influence on the activity of protease enzyme. The activity of total protease and leucine aminopeptidase enzyme was significantly higher in the larvae reared at the density of 10 than that at the densities of 1 and 30 larvae per jar, but the activity of amylase enzyme was not affected by larval density. The change trend of relative mass of larval midgut among three densities was consistent with the activity of total protease and leucine aminopeptidase enzyme. The variation of digestive enzyme activity may be relevant to the midgut relative mass. Thus, larval population-density is one of the major factors affecting feeding behavior feature of L. sticticalis. These results provide evidence for clarifying the different damage feature between the outbreak and common populations.

TI  - Monitoring cotton bollworms with pheromone trap catches and their relation with weather parameters
AB  - Studies on population dynamics of Earias insulana (Fabricius), E. vittella (Boisdual), Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) were made by using pheromone traps in kharif season under rainfed conditions during 2007-2008. Results of trap catch data of all the bollworms revealed a fluctuating population throughout the study period. Irrespective of bollworms, the peak trappings were observed during 6-9th, 23rd, 38-46th standard weeks. Minimum catches of all the bollworms were observed during 27th-31st standard week. Population dynamics of bollworms comprised pink bollworm (31.46%), american bollworm (29.50%), spiny bollworm (21.00%) and spotted bollworm (18.01%) in an hierarchy with a total catches of 1,144.00 bollworms from all the species. Trap catches of P. gossypiella had significant positive correlation with minimum temperature whereas significant negative correlation was observed for E. insulana with afternoon relative humidity (RH2). However, significant negative correlation was obtained with humidity and rainfall with P. gossypiella alone. The installation of pheromone traps helped to detect infestation early in the season and led to appropriate and timely plant protection measures. Hence, pheromone traps serve as ecofriendly and a vital tool in monitoring the cotton bollworms which can be effectively adopted in IPM programs to increase the cotton yield.

TI  - Seasonal incidence of Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee in brinjal and the effect of abiotic factors on its population dynamics
AB  - The seasonal incidence of brinjal shoot and fruit borer, Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee was studied from the pheromone trap catches during kharif 2009 and 2010 in Keonjhar district of Odisha. It was observed that the pest first made its appearance during 24th standard week (2nd week of June) in both the years of experiment and then registered an upward trend with two distinct peaks during the month of August and September. The correlation studies on abiotic factors and population dynamics revealed that only minimum temperature exhibited a significant positive correlation with the adult population level of L. orbonalis. However, the extent of variation in adult trap catch due to the multiple interactions of abiotic factors was estimated to be 50.2 per cent during 2009 and 64.2 per cent during 2010.

TI  - New insights into the biology and ecology of Cydia pomonella from apple orchards in Croatia
AB  - The biology and ecology of three codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (CM), populations from Croatia were investigated. The effects of current and past climate regimes on the behaviour of the three CM populations were investigated, and the changes in their biology and ecology were observed. The first population investigated was free from chemical control treatment, whereas the other two populations were subjected to chemical control. Climate data were obtained from LUFT climatological stations in Croatia. A later emergence of adult moths in the spring, later oviposition and later emergence of larvae occurred in the untreated orchard versus the treated orchards. In the untreated orchard, two generations of CMs were observed per year, whereas an additional third flight period of the moths was observed in the treated orchards. The results of this study confirm the possibility that a third generation of the pest can develop in Croatia in years in which the sum of degree-day is higher than average.

TI  - Performance of maize cultivars and management strategies against stem borer in farmers fields of Karnataka State
AB  - The survey on the incidence of stem borers in maize was made during 2008-09 and 2009-10 in 12 districts of Karnataka. The survey data indicated that stem borers (Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) and Sesamia inferens Walker) incidence was quite prominent in all the places surveyed. The stem borer infestation varied enormously among different cultivated maize hybrids (2.33 to 32.60%). Farmers commonly used endosulfan 35EC spray @ 2-3 ml/lit, Phorate 10G @ 8-10 kg/ha and Carbofuran 3G @ 4-6 kg/ha to combat stem borer menace particularly in Davanagere and Haveri districts and about 14-19 per cent of the farmers adopted chemical control measures. As opined by farmers, an average yield loss of 12.42 per cent was noticed in Haveri district as compared to 5.20 per cent in Chitradurga. However, loss in terms of grain quality is of great concern to farmers.

TI  - The impact of jasmine moth Palpitavitrealis (Rossi) in different olive cultivars in Cova da Beira. / Impacto da traa-verde Palpita vitrealis (Rossi) em diferentes cultivares de oliveirana Cova da Beira
AB  - The attacks of jasmine moth were monitored in three olive cultivars, 'Arbequina', 'Cobranosa' and 'Galega Vulgar', in a five years old olive grove and also in a plot of 'Galega Vulgar' one year old near Belmonte. The observations were carried out in 2000, from April 5 to November 7 and the first symptoms were observed on July 7. 'Cobranosa' was significantly less attacked throughout the observation period and no significant differences were detected between the remaining. In order to explain thesedifferences, leaf thickness of the different cultivars were compared by histological cuts but no differences were detected. No other differences regarding the presence and abundance of trichomes were found.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of cabbage armyworm (Mamestra brassicae [L.], Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) in the region of Ljubljana [Conference poster]. / Sezonska dinamika kapusove sovke (Mamestra brassicae [L.], Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) na obmoju Ljubljane
AB  - The cabbage armyworm is polyphagous insect species, which caterpillars are known by the damage on cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata L.) leaves, but they can also be pests of other crop plants. From 2008 to 2010 we conducted a monitoring of adults at the Laboratory Field of the Biotechnical Faculty in Ljubljana. The main aim of the research was to evaluate the flight start of adult males, and to determinate connections between the pest occurrence and the average air daily temperatures and average daily amounts of precipitations. By using four pheromone traps (type VARL+ Csalomon, Budapest) we have caught male organisms in the field with different cabbage genotypes. During the first year, when the number of moths were the lowest, the first males appeared between the 2nd and the 9th of June. In the next two years the number of pests captured on the target field were higher. At the same time it was noticed two generations of the pest. In 2009 we found out that the peak of the first generation was between the 26th of May and the 3rd of June. The second peak was reached between the 12th and the 24 th of August. The expected appearance of the first generation moths was defined by the sum of the effective temperatures (hypothetical lower developmental threshold was 10C).

TI  - Population dynamics of gram pod borer, Helicovprpa armigera (Hubner)
AB  - The experiment was conducted for monitoring the population dynamics of gram pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) by the use of sex pheromone (Helilure) at Karmveer Kakasaheb Wagh College of Agriculture, Nashik (M.S.) during Rabi season 2007-08. Total five pheromone traps were installed in the gram field comprising the varieties viz., Vishal, Virat and Vihar. Observations were recorded daily in morning regarding the number of moths of H. armigera attracted in each of the traps from December 2007 to March 2008. The data were compiled on weekly basis. The data indicated that, the catches of moths were increasing irrespective of varieties from 4th week of December, 2007 (9 months) when maximum and minimum temperatures were 29.0C and 13.9C with morning and evening relative humidity 75.1 per cent and 60.6 per cent, respectively and observed peak at 1st week of February (151 moths) when the maximum and minimum temperatures were 23.9C and 6.5C with morning and evening relative humidity of 62.6 per cent and 30.1 per cent, respectively. The pest gradually decreased and reached at rock bottom level of 2 moths during 3rd week of March, 2008, when maximum and minimum temperatures were of 36.3C and 20.8C with morning and evening relative humidity of 57.8 per cent and 24.4 per cent respectively. The moth emergence was found to be negatively and significantly correlated with the maximum temperature (r=-0.62) and minimum temperature (r=-0.75) while there was significant relationship between relative humidity and pest incidence.

TI  - Eldana saccharina sex appeal a future method to monitor and control this pest?
AB  - The first step towards integrated pest management is the timely detection of pest infestation. Insect traps not only allow detection and monitoring of a pest problem but also provide estimates regarding pest population density. Monitoring pest populations with pheromone-baited traps is one of the most useful applications derived from basic research in chemical ecology. Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) has been an important pest throughout the South African sugar industry for more than 40 years. Nevertheless, a pheromone based monitoring system and the possibility of the use of pheromones in a mating disruption approach to control, remain elusive. In order to investigate the sex pheromone signal sent by E. saccharina males, laboratory based behavioural experiments have revealed different degrees of attraction depending on the sex, condition and age of the moth. Indeed, whereas females and males are both significantly attracted by calling males, only females significantly preferred the odour emanating from male hair pencils, and none reacted to extracts from these hair pencils. In addition, preliminary electroantennography experiments demonstrated that vanillin, previously identified as a major pheromonal compound of E. saccharina, is not detected by the moths. Therefore, a new investigation of the hair pencil gland extract is needed, which could lead to a breakthrough in the understanding of E. saccharina sexual attraction and behaviour.

TI  - Does intraguild predation of Cosmia trapezina L. (Lep. Noctuidae) influence the abundance of other Lepidoptera forest pests?
AB  - The noctuid C. trapezina (CT) has been considered an occasional predator of other Lepidoptera larvae. Functional/numerical response of predator and/or prey was estimated using 27 years of time-series data from Slovakia and stepwise multiple regression models (SMRM). SMRM were used to examine a possible delayed density-dependent feedback. We constructed 12 order-three autoregressive models [AR(3)] for CT and candidate prey. Independent variables were abundance of C. trapezina and abundance of candidate prey in lags 1, 2, and 3. Model variants were (1) predation on free feeder models (FFM); (2) predation on shelter feeder models (SFM); (3) predation on the sum of 8 species models (S8M); (4) predation on all Lepidoptera models (ALM). Models were constructed for three areas (created by grouping sites based on significant correlations among CT populations). Additional comparative models were constructed for another three noctuid species and one geometrid species to compare their regression parameters under the same conditions as for CT. In total, 48 AR(3) SMRM were constructed for comparative species. A negative response of shelter feeders was found in models mainly for CT. We also found the positive response of CT growth rate to abundance of shelter feeders in lag 3 on two out of three models. This pattern was not found for any other comparison of species in the analysis. Possible mechanisms for these results are discussed.

TI  - Survey on the spread of Tuta absoluta in cultural environments in Piedmont. / Indagine sulla diffusione di Tuta absoluta negli ambienti colturali piemontesi
AB  - This paper presents the results of a survey conducted in 2010 to investigate the level and distribution of infestation of T. absoluta in Piedmont, Italy. Traps for T. absoluta were placed between April and June in the field with cultivated tomato, aubergine, bell pepper and bean [Phaseolus vulgaris] in the provinces of Alessandria, Asti, Cuneo and Turin. The data collected showed that T. absoluta has now spread throughout the investigation, but with varying population levels. Monitoring showed a higher infestation in stations in Castellazzo Bormida in Alessandria on processing and table tomatoes in the tunnel, where the average number of weekly catches exceeded 100 individuals. In these areas, during the summer season, a more intensive sampling of the moth population was performed. These areas were found suited for their crops and plenty of catches of T. absoluta were recorded.

TI  - Evaluation of agronomic characteristics, nutritional contents, and insect response of the transgenic potato resistant to glufosinate ammonium
AB  - The agronomic characteristics, nutritional contents, and insect response of the potato clones transformed with a glufosinate ammonium resistance gene were evaluated. Among the 4 transgenic potato clones, the Bar 3 clone was selected as a promising one for commercialization. The Bar 3 clone showed similar tuber yield capacity but higher herbicide resistance as compared with the non-transgenic potato cv. Dejima. The herbicide resistance of the Bar 3 clone was more than 5 times higher when tested with the herbicide concentration recommended by the producer. The major agronomic characteristics of the Bar 3 clone were not different from those of the non-transgenic Dejima. The annual variation in yields and agronomic characteristics showed similar tendency for 2 years from the third to fourth generation after transformation. The tubers of the Bar 3 clone also showed low occurrence in common scab and physiological disorders such as cracking and secondary growth. But the reasons for such results are yet to be studied. Also, it was considered that the Bar 3 clone have a potential of reducing not only common scab occurrence but also soil erosion during potato cultivation in field. The nutritional contents (mineral compound, vitamin C and amino acid) and response to Spodoptera exigua of the transgenic potato clones were not significantly different.

TI  - Prediction of pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders)) population cycles in cotton by accumulating thermal units in the agro-climate of Faisalabad
AB  - Studies on forecasting population fluctuations of pink bollworm (PBW) of cotton, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae), were conducted on the basis of accumulation of degree-days (DD). Pheromone trap PBW moth catches per trap per night and the field infestation showed cyclic peaks at the intervals of 323 Celsius DD's. The predicted and observed moth population peaks largely conformed to three years of study. These results indicate that DD can help to detect periods of high risk for moth activity and thus can be used for a management of this pest throughout the crop season. Based on results, different factors responsible for PBW moth population peaks are discussed.

AB  - This study was carried out in Tarsus (Mersin) environs that early table grape growing is common, in 2008-2009. In this study, it was aimed to determine the European grapevine moth [Lobesia botrana Den.&Schiff. (Lep. Tortricidae)]'s control based some criteria such as the first adult emergence time, adult population fluctuations, the highest population periods and the time of adults activation in nature with generation number. In conclusion, it was determined that the first emergence of L. botrana adults was between the end of February and early March, the pest has four peaks a year (April, May-June, July-August, September). But, the last two peaks occurred after harvest were not very obvious due to low population density. In addition, it was observed that the first peak coincided with flowering period (April, 1. generation) whereas the second one occured during unripe berry and beginning of loss of green color (May-June, 2. generation). While the adult flights ended between the end of September and the first half of October, L. botrana was active for seven months and produced four generations per year.

TI  - Patterns of larval incidence of shoot and fruit borer, Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee in eggplant ecosystem of coastal Orissa
AB  - Field studies were conducted in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India, during the 2006-07 winter and 2007 summer seasons, to determine the patterns of larval population changes of the shoot and fruit borer, Leucinodes orbonalis, in aubergine cv. Purnima. Fluctuations in the larval population of L. orbonalis were monitored during the entire crop period. Results showed the presence of overlapping generations of L. orbonalis throughout the crop growth periods of both seasons and preliminary studies showed the occurrence of 3 overlapping generations from November to May. Peak ova counts were recorded in weeks 6 and 14 during winter and summer, respectively. Peak larval incidence of L. orbonalis in week 7 coincided with the flowering and fruiting stage of the winter crop, while in the summer crop, both ova and larvae of mixed instars were noticed at the early vegetative stage. The shoot and fruit borer, irrespective of larval instars, was found in large numbers in fruits, followed by shoots and flowers. The flowering and fruiting stages of the winter crop and early vegetative stage of the summer crop were considered as vulnerable stages for the insect attack in coastal Orissa and initiation of control measures prior to these crop stages merit attention for the suppression of L. orbonalis populations.

TI  - Integrated control of Ephestia cautella (Walker) in a confectionary factory
AB  - In a confectionary factory, integrated pest-management techniques were used for 12 months. Ephestia cautella is the major pest in this industry. Its presence was monitored using pheromone traps and water traps. The most critical areas were identified and water traps were better at identifying these areas than pheromone traps. Intensive cleaning and structural improvements were carried out when necessary. Water traps have been used as a mass trapping system because they catch both males and females. Catches in water traps showed a decrease in population density after 8-9 months. In a confined area, a mating disruption system was applied to interfere with moth mating. Most females caught with water traps were mated, although in the area where mating disruption was applied, the percentage of unmated females was higher compared with areas where mating disruption was not used.

TI  - Survey on the diffusion and the biology of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) in Veneto region. / Indagini sulla diffusione e sulla biologia della tignola della patata (Phthorimaea operculella) in veneto
AB  - In the Po Valley Phthorimaea operculella Zeller is a very important pest, wich has been responsible of serious damages in recent years in potato crop. In the following work the evolution of flight of adults have been explored in cultivated fields and in the local processing stores in the main area of potato production Veneto. Moreover, the origin and extent of infestation of the tubers in the centers of collection and storage has been investigated. The data show that the potato moth is widespread and its population increase from the end of June and continue up to mid-October, in the absence of the crop too. In the processing stores the pest's presence is always detected it was low but constant throughout the period of collection of potato. On average, the tubers of processing centers, which were delivered after 40 days of storage, showed a loss of 15% if properly protected, while those were without protection for the insects, showed a loss of 40%. The insecticide treatments are just one of the tools available within an integrated control and for their correct and rational use need further and more detailed studies to a greater understanding of the biology of the moth.

Data about the phenology (bud breaking, duration and intensity of blossom), yield and loss of fruits were collected. Susceptibilities for infections by Monilia sp. and Blumeriella jaapii and differences in the occurrence of aphids were assessed. 2007 and 2008 the most important fungus was Blumeriella jaapii, 2009 some days with high amounts of rain during blossom caused heavy damages by Monilia sp., depending from the variety. The varieties 'Achat', 'Safir', 'Ciganymeggy 7', 'Oblacinska', 'Jade', 'Rubellit' and 'Hartei' had good yields in spite of the difficult weather conditions in 2009. This research work is part of the project "Evaluation and Optimizing of biological control methods of plum moth (Cydia funebrana) and Monilia-disease in organic stone fruit production", granted by the Bundesprogramm kologischer Landbau (FuE 06OE198).

TI  - Population dynamics of pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) infesting chickpea
AB  - The results of the investigation on population dynamics of chickpea pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) on chickpea revealed that the pest appeared from 2nd week of December and attained a peak of 3.12 larvae per plant during 2nd week of January. The pest was active during the last week of December to 3rd week of January. Later on, the pest population declined gradually towards the maturity of the crop. Correlation of H. armigera with different weather parameters indicated that maximum temperature exhibited highly significant negative correlation (r=-0.7514) with larval population of H. armigera, whereas, minimum temperature (r=-0.5771) and mean temperature (r=-0.6836) exhibited significant negative correlation. However, the pest population showed highly significant positive correlation with morning relative humidity (r=0.7098), evening relative humidity (r=0.7293) and mean relative humidity (r=0.8063).

TI  - Mass trapping of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller in a traditional flour mill
AB  - Results obtained by mass trapping method, using the synthetic pheromone (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate (TDA), to control the population of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller in a large traditional flour mill are reported. The surveys were carried out over a period of five years. Forty-two funnel traps, each baited with 2 mg of TDA, were placed in the mill on March 2004 and kept until November 2008. Eight additional traps were located around the exterior of the facility, especially in the wheat silo area and near loading equipment. In almost five years, the pheromone traps attracted a total of 54,170 male E. kuehniella. Considering only the catch data obtained from the traps located in the internal departments of the mill, 28,360 specimens were captured. Outside the plant, 1,975 males were trapped. From the trap counts obtained it was possible to identify the locations of the main foci of infestation. With regard to the pest control attained by mass trapping techniques, trap catches of E. kuehniella inside the mill revealed a conspicuous decrease in the population density (of about 92.2%) comparing the data obtained in 2008 with that from 2004. The population density of the pest outside the mill also decreased from the first until the last year of the surveys. The infestation was maintained at a low level, especially during the last two years of the study, when the Integrated Pest Management program applied in the plant did not include general fumigations but only localized insecticide treatments and careful cleaning of the various departments (wheat storage bins, processing and packaging areas, milling products warehouses and the loading zone) and the interior of all equipment.

TI  - Pheromones, sex attractants and kairomones in weed and insect biological control an emerging frontier of tools to manage risk and reward
AB  - Pheromone traps can help to determine the establishment and population size of new pest and beneficial organisms, as well their phenology, synchrony with their host, dispersal, and rate of spread. The application of lures for biocontrol agents introduced against either insects or weeds is emerging as an expanding use pattern for semiochemicals. The kairomonal trapping of biocontrol agents including parasitoids and predators of scale insects represent the earliest examples of this new application for studying population trends. The deliberate development of a sex attractant for gorse pod moth (Cydia succedana) was probably the first example of the use of attractants in weed biocontrol, although there have now been several others developed and used after release of new organisms. After the lure was identified in Hawaii, trapping showed that the gorse (Ulex europaeus) biocontrol agent Agonopterix umbellana was established in New Zealand, and enabled field experiments to determine the minimum number of moth pairs required for establishment. The recent discovery of a newly-introduced parasitoid with attraction to the obscure mealybug pheromone showed that both can be monitored in one trap. Bioprospecting for new biocontrol agents using kairomones such as mealybug pheromones in the centre of biodiversity could help to offer a new risk mitigation tool for classical biocontrol. These cases of pheromones for monitoring biocontrol agents suggest that the area warrants development, especially since it also informs us about pest incursion biology. Catoblastis cactorum in Mexico has proven that some insects can be both successful biocontrol agents and unwanted pest organisms.

TI  - Population development of apple clearwing moth (Synanthedon myopaeformis Borkh., Lepidoptera Sesiidae) in Canakkale province. / Canakkale ilinde elma gvdekurdu (Synanthedon myopaeformis Borkh., Lepidoptera Sesiidae)'nun poplasyon gelismesi
AB  - Canakkale province has an important potential for apple production. In apple production, damage of Apple Clearwing Moth (Synathedon myopaeformis) Borkh (Lepidoptera; Sesiidae) is considerable. This study was executed in Canakkale in the years 2006-2007, to acquire some data for control of the pest. Population development of apple clearwing moth was investigated by counting the adults in pheromone traps weekly, in 3 orchards in central district and 1 orchard in Lapseki-Umurbey in 2006 and in 5 orchards in central district in 2007. Emergence of adults has started at the end of April in both years. In 2006, increase of adult emergence was observed towards the end of May and 20 adults were seen in every trap in Kepez-1 orchard in central district. Despite the observation of adults in traps in Kepez-2 orchard, Sarayck village and Lapseki district through all season, density of population remained low and counting of adults continued until the beginning of September. Similarly in 2007, adults was first caught in traps at the end of April, adult number per trap was counted as an average of 20 in the middle of May and adult number was low in other orchards. As a result adult population density was found high at the beginning of the season in 2006 and 2007. But population density of the pest was found different for all orchards. This situation was related to the difference of practices between different orchards.

TI  - Fighting against Adodxophyes osana peel moth of fruits thru "attract and kill" method
AB  - Field studies were conducted in Romania, in 2008, to determine the biology and population density using pheromone traps and the effect of the MESAJ AR biopesticide in controlling the peel moth (Adoxophyes orana) in apple orchards. The treatments comprised with pheromone trapping, MESAJ AR biopesticide application, insecticide application and control. The results showed that A. orana affected and destroyed up to 37% of buds and leaves of apple trees in the 2008 spring season. A. orana developed 2 generations per year and the adult flight being strongly influenced by the dynamics of the climatic factors. The monitoring of the pest population was achieved using the pheromone traps and the use of sex pheromones decreased the frequency of attack made to fruits up to 76.92%. Applying the pheromone with the attract and kill method increased the efficiency up to 15.38%.

TI  - Detection of sugarcane African stalk borer Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) using hyperspectral remote sensing (spectroradiometry)
AB  - The South African sugar industry is one of the world's leading sugarcane producers. The stalk borer Eldana saccharina has for many years been the most destructive pest in the South African sugar industry and is the most important factor limiting sugarcane productivity. The pest has been monitored using a traditional visual approach whereby a representative sample of stalks is taken from a field and split longitudinally to assess damage and count the number of E. saccharina. This approach is time-consuming, labour intensive and sometimes biased as, in some instances, only easily accessible areas are surveyed. To investigate a more economical but equally sensitive survey methodology, this paper aims at determining the potential use of hyperspectral remote sensing (spectroradiometry) for identifying sugarcane infested by E. saccharina. A hand-held ASD (Field Spec 3) spectroradiometer was used to take leaf spectral measurements of sugarcane plants from a potted-plant trial taking place under shade house conditions. In this trial, nitrogen and silicon fertiliser applications as well as varieties used were known. In addition, watering regimes and artificial infestation of E. saccharina were carefully controlled. Results illustrated that severe E. saccharina infestation increased reflectance throughout the whole spectrum range (400-2500 nm). E. saccharina stalk damage was also linearly related to modified normalized difference vegetation index (mNDVI) using R2025 and R2200 (R2=0.69). It was concluded that hyperspectral data has a potential for use in monitoring E. saccharina in sugarcane rapidly and non-destructively under controlled conditions. A follow-up study is recommended in field conditions and using airborne and/or spaceborne hyperspectral sensors.

TI  - Progress of the area-wide integrated pest management plan for Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in the midlands north region of Kwazulu-Natal
AB  - In 2005, 14 farms in the Midlands North Extension Region were reported with Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae). Currently, a further 29 farms in this region are known to have this pest in their sugarcane. It is thus firmly entrenched in the Midlands North Region (MNR), and is spreading. This 207% increase in known localities over three years in this region is disturbing, and highlights the urgent need for growers to implement the IPM plan presented in 2005, on an area wide basis. This paper demonstrates the increased occurrence and spread of E. saccharina in ecozones 1-6, 8, 10 and 11 since 2005. Using already known ecological data on E. saccharina, soil characteristics and climatic forecasts, it is evident that ecozone 7 is the next likely area to suffer an increase in E. saccharina numbers, should growers continue with the slow implementation of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan and the Environmental Management System (EMS), which are aimed at minimising the threat of E. saccharina in their areas.

TI  - Monitoring of codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) in Celje region in years 2004 to 2009. / Spremljanje jabolnega zavijaa (Cydia pomonella L.) na obmoju Celjske regije od leta 2004 do 2009
AB  - Monitoring and forecasting about occurrence and development of harmful organisms in fruit growing is based on evaluation of biotic and abiotic factors and take an active part in the Observation and forecasting service of Slovenia, which is organized in five regional centers. Codling moth, the most important permanent pest of apple orchards, can cause high yield losses, so it needs to be suppressed. Development of codling moth is observed using biotechnical instruments, evaluation of meteorological data and field observations. These modes of monitoring help us to predict the need and optimal time for control of codling moth in apple orchards. By means of a good forecasting system this is the only way to reduce the use of plant protection products (PPP) and also to reduce the accumulation of PPP in fruits, soil and environment. In this article the modes of codling moth monitoring in Celje region are presented.

TI  - Procesing tomato biodiversity and ecological infra-structures. / Tomate para indstria biodiversidade e infra-estruturas ecolgicas
AB  - In this study, we address the theory behind the ecological functions provided by biodiversity and ecological infra-structures, as well as their role in enhancing the performance of natural enemies, in agrarian ecosystems. This study focuses on the processing tomato agrarian ecosystem. In this crop, the key pest is the tomato fruitworm, which is followed by a complex of natural enemies, essentially parasitoids. This parasitoid complex has been monitored from 2002 to 2004 under the scope of the project AGRO 189 - "Integrated pest management in processing tomato"; it has been observed that this community is present in the field every year and may strongly influence the populations of the tomato fruitworm. Some field observations that arose during field studies are addressed and interpreted bearing in mind the availability of ecological infra-structures present in the fields surveyed, namely aspects related to population dynamics of both the key pest and its natural enemies, and to the biodiversity of the parasitoid complex. Assuming that natural enemies and pests benefit differentially from ecological infrastructures, the possibility of habitat manipulation of agrarian ecosystems in order to favour antagonists is discussed.

TI  - Spatial distribution of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) larvae in chickpea, Cicer arietinum L
AB  - The spatial distribution of Helicoverpa armigera larvae in chickpea was investigated in Orissa, India, during the crop seasons of 1999/2000, 2000/01 and 2001/02. The larval density data fitted to the Taylor's power law revealed the distribution pattern of the gram caterpillar as random despite fluctuations in the mean larval density across fields and crop seasons. Separate sampling plans for precise estimation of the larval population density in chickpea were suggested as the sample size was inversely related with the mean larval density.

TI  - Additional strains of the Noogoora burr rust fungus to enhance biocontrol in Northern Australia
AB  - Baseline data on populations of Noogoora burr (Xanthium occidentale), the rust fungus (Puccinia xanthii) and the gall-forming biological control insect Epiblema strenuana are being collected at two sites in the Northern Territory (Daly and Victoria Rivers) and one in northern Western Australia (Cunningham River near Fitzroy Crossing). This work was undertaken to better understand the ecology of Noogoora burr and population dynamics of the existing biological control agents. The baseline data gathered will be essential to assess future impact of the additional strains, should they be approved for release in Australia. At each site, five transects set up at approximately 500 m intervals along the river are monitored once-a-year and data are collected on Noogoora burr density, plant structure, reproduction and the incidence and severity of damage caused by the biological control agents. Soil core samples are also taken to assess the soil seed bank.

TI  - Field trapping of the American bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) with the sex pheromone
AB  - Helicoverpa armigera Hb. is found on many different host plants in Egypt. Field trapping showed that the most preferred hosts were tomato, followed by okra and maize. Highest population density in tomato, okra and maize was recorded in August, during the successive seasons of 2005 and 2006. Multiple regression analysis showed that only the temperature degree had a considerable and significant influence on the insect populations of H. armigera. Meanwhile, the relative humidity and wind speed did not significantly influence the population. The sex pheromone trap containing (Z)-11-Hexadecenal, (Z)-9-Hexadecenal and (Z)-7-Hexadecenal was highly effective for monitoring the insect pest in tomato, okra and maize fields.

TI  - Effect of strip intercropping for management of the American bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hbner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) in Morrumbala District
AB  - This work was carried out in Morrumbala District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique, during the 2005/2007 cropping season and it had as objective to evaluating the effect of strip intercropping for the management of bollworm, Heliothis armigera Hbner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) on Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) yield. Four treatments were set, cotton strip intercropped with Sorghum bicolor L. Moench, cotton strip intercropped with Cajanus Cajan, cotton strip intercropped with Crotalaria orchroleuca, and cotton pure crop in a split plot design. Each treatment was subdivided into two subplots, first subplot sprayed with insecticide according the economic threshold (scouting) and the second subplot unsprayed. All treatments were weekly monitored after cotton emergence for Heliothis armigera, other phytophagous insects and insect predators' incidence. The population of the H. armigera and other phytophagous insects was lower in the cotton strip intercropped than in pure cotton (control) and the total number of natural enemies was more abundant in the cotton strip intercropping. All phytophagous insects and natural enemies were relatively higher in the unsprayed plots. The natural enemies and total rainfall were evaluated and their relationships with H. armigera on cotton were studied. Strip intercropping in all treatments showed significantly higher cotton yield when compared to cotton pure crop.

TI  - Swarming examination of European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn.) in Hungary in 2006. / A kukoricamoly (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn.) 2006-os magyarorszgi rajzskp vizsglata
AB  - We made the 2006 years swarming examination of European corn borer (ECB) in Hungary by processing the data of the Plant Protection Information System (NIR) of Central Plant Protection and Soil Conservation Service. We wondered about swarming of ECB after the humid 2004 and 2005 years in 2006. The results proved unequivocally, that the revealing proportion numbers of ECB swarming (flight peak quotient and cumulative moth catch) was decreased, and altered in accordance with the previously years. However, the ECB swarmed two flight peaks in more regions of Hungary, the appearance of dominant flight peak in the second part of summer was cancelled in spite of previously years. The examinations of flight peak quotients of arid and humid years didn''t prove (f=2,169; p=0,147) the altering of peaks in proportion to each other. The frequent precipitation in July and August intermitted, cut up more peaks and shifted the swarming time of ECB (Nagybajom). The statistical survey confirmed against a significant correlation between the increasing of trapped individual number and the increasing temperature and precipitation. The stimulant effect of precipitation to swarming can be explanable with high relative humidity too.

TI  - Some years experience in the control of oriental fruit moth (Grapholita molesta Busck.) by false-trail following. / Nekajletne izkunje pri zatiranju breskovega zavijaa (Grapholita molesta Busck.) zmetodo dezorientacije
AB  - Oriental fruit moth remains the most important pest on peaches in Littoral region in Slovenia. The population increases from year to year and consequently damage caused on the yield. In contrast with pest population increasing, the selection of authorised insecticides against the Oriental fruit moth has been reduced due to the different reasons. The method of false-trail following with low synthetic pheromone rate represents a new chance for successful control of Oriental fruit moth. From 2004 to 2006 three different protocols were compared false-trail following, chemical control and false-trail following combined and classical chemical control. The chemical control and method of false-trail following combined gave the highest level of effectiveness in all three years. The portion of attached fruits was 1%, 1.7% and 1.4% respectively and was comparable to the results given by classical chemical control at least.

TI  - Kaolin as a possible treatment against lepidopteran larvae and mites in organic fruit production
AB  - Few control methods are available in Norwegian organic fruit production that can prevent damage by early and late larvae. Also phytophagous mites are difficult to control without harming the beneficial mites. Processed kaolin function by coating trees and thus creating a physical barrier to infestation, impeding movement, feeding and egg-laying. Kaolin may reduce feeding and movement of over-wintering tortricide larvae and other larvae that hatch early in spring and have a repellent effect against egg-laying tortricide females in summer. Kaolin may also have a control effect against mites as it clings to the body and reduce feeding. Trials with kaolin were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 in plum and apple orchards. Results show that kaolin reduces the population of rust mite, however it also affected the number of beneficial mites. The effect against early and late larvae was more variable. Treatments with kaolin resulted in a small reduction in early larvae and damage in some fields and years, however no clear effect against late larvae was found. The effect of kaolin will be discussed in relation to population size and number of treatments.

TI  - Impact of climate change on population dynamics of insect pests
AB  - The occurrence of climate changes is evident from increase in global average temperature, changes in the rainfall pattern and extreme climatic events. These seasonal and long term changes would affect the fauna, flora and population dynamics of insect pests. The abiotic parameters are known to have direct impact on insect population dynamics through modulation of developmental rates, survival, fecundity, voltinism and dispersal. Among the climatic factors, temperature is an important factor. The studies showed that, declined survival rate of brown plant hopper Nilaparvatha lugens (Stal) and rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guen) at higher temperature indicates the impacts of rising temperature could do the changes in the pest population dynamics of rice ecosystem. The alteration in the voltinism also could be the results of warming and it is more profit to multivoltine species and voltinism could be reflected in changes in the geographical distribution. Beside these, elevated CO2 also showed some impact on pest's population abundance, the crop grown under the elevated CO2 could alter the nutritional value of plants; it may alter the insect abundance and increase the consumption rate of herbivores. Therefore climate change would result in changes in the population dynamics of insect pests. Thus temperature rise plays a pivotal role in insect population dynamics.

TI  - Lepidopterous insect fauna of Mt. Bokju-san (Gangwon-do) in Korea
AB  - The study was investigated lepidopterous insect fauna of Mt. Bokju-san located in Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea, its changes in the number of monthly species and the number of individuals from April, 2011 to March, 2012. This study was identified a total of 401 species belonging to 16 families of lepidopterous insect fauna inhabiting Mt. Bokju-san. Based on dominance by families, Noctuidae, with 133 species, was the most dominant species, followed by Geometridae (115), Crambidae (32), and Notodontidae (25). The most abundant species was Cosmia camptostigma (214 individuals), followed by Catocala streckeri, Arichanna melanaria, Bombyx shini. Monthly distribution indicated that Geometridae was the most dominant species from November to May, and Noctuidae was the most dominant from June to October. The number of individuals increased from March to June. On the other hand, it decreased consistently after June. The number of collected individuals showed that Noctuidae (834) was the largest of all, followed by Geometridae (748), Arctiidae (164). With regard to the dominant species in early spring, Apochima juglansiaria and Conistra fletcheri were dominant in March and Idiotephria amelia in April. Inurois brunneus was dominant in late fall.

TI  - Field testing Desire Delta trap and GLS sex pheromone lure system for measuring outbreak and basal populations of Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera Nolidae)
AB  - In December 2009 and January 2010 an outbreak of Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera Nolidae), the gumleaf skeletonizer (GLS) that affects jarrah, Eucalyptus marginata, became apparent in south-western Western Australia in the vicinity of Yanmah (349S, 11601E), Carter (3405S, 11602E) and Quinninup (3423E, 11617E) forest blocks. By the end of January 2011 the outbreak severely affected more than 250000 ha of jarrah forest. This study is a preliminary field trial of the Desire GLS pheromone lure and trap system that compares trap results with larval populations determined from branch-clip samples. Thirteen of 19 sites for deployment of the trap and lure system were selected from an array of 61 sites from which GLS larval density data from November 2010 had been collected, and trap sites included six Forestcheck sites, for which long-term monitoring of forest condition had been undertaken. These 19 sites were across a rainfall gradient, and provided a strong contrast in outbreak severity between eastern and western sites. The GLS lure was highly specific for GLS, with a mean capture rate of 55 male moths per site. However, a trap at a site with a thick tall understorey that had supported a large larval population captured only four moths. The trap and GLS lure system are effective for monitoring both outbreak and basal populations of GLS in jarrah forest with an open understory. Moth captures from lure traps are an effective alternative to monitoring GLS larval populations, with the reservation that the trap system has impaired effectiveness in locations with thick understory that exceeds the trap height.

TI  - Lack of anisotropic effects in the spatial distribution of Cydia pomonella pheromone trap catches in Catalonia, NE Spain
AB  - The codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), is the key pest of pome fruits in many parts of Europe and its adult flights are routinely monitored by means of sex pheromone traps checked every week during the season. We analyzed the current pheromone trap spatial configuration of codling moth located in a study area of 160,000 ha in Catalonia during the period 2004-2006, optimized under the hypothesis of isotropy of insect catches after a preliminary study. The objectives were to test for spatial isotropy of male catches and to determine whether the spatial trap configuration was optimal in terms of the number of traps required to monitor the pest flight and the spatial process under analysis. To this end, we studied the possible presence of directional components (i.e. anisotropic effects) in the spatial distribution of male catches for the present trap configuration. The predominant wind direction was specifically tested as this may affect the flight of adult males. We developed a simple Monte Carlo approach to test anisotropic effects comparing distinct directional variograms with the trap catches of the three years. Our results suggest that insect spatial patterns were in general isotropic and that the predominant wind direction did not consistently affect the spatial distribution of insect trap catches; only 7 of 58 weeks had anisotropic effects. Since these anisotropic effects were likely residual, we conclude that the current trap spatial structure is optimal in terms of the number of traps used under the hypothesis of isotropy of insect catches.

AB  - Defoliation by herbivores may alter the sourcesink balance of trees leading to transient decreases in carbon (C) stores. When C stores are replenished concurrently with re-growth both processes may compete, store formation proceeding at the expenses of growth. However, the interactions between both processes are not fully understood. We investigated the effects of defoliation by the pine processionary moth (PPM, Thaumetopoea pityocampa Dennis and Schiff.) on the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and nitrogen (N) stores and the growth of Pinus nigra Arnold trees. Short-term effects were evaluated immediately after a PPM outbreak and at the end of the first growing season in trees suffering a range of defoliation damage. Long-term effects were explored by a 17-year-long PPM defoliation experiment, with 11 years of repeated defoliation treatments followed by 6 years of recovery. Defoliation by PPM was followed by transient NSC decreases, but trees were able to exceed initial NSC pools and compensate growth in just one growing season. Such recovery was linked to increased foliage N. Repeated severe defoliations decreased growth and survival of trees in the long-term, but trees increased starch allocation to stems. Defoliation led to an accumulation of C storage compounds in P. nigra trees irrespective of their ability to re-grow. In trees included in the short-term experiment, the accumulation of stores proceeded concurrently with re-growth. However, the repeated severe defoliations included in our long-term experiment impaired the growth of trees, surplus C being accumulated as stores. These results indicate that, growth declines in pines defoliated by PPM are not due to C (source) limitation but may respond to the reduced sink strength of growing meristems due to defoliation, and thus, a decrease in C allocation to growth.

TI  - The behaviour of codling moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in the Croatian apple orchards
AB  - The codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), is the most important pest in apple production in Croatia and abroad. The pest is very adaptable to different climatic conditions and is known for the development of resistance to several chemical groups of insecticides. Because of these reasons, the populations of codling moth are differentiated in many ecotypes of various biological and physiological development requirements. Following the dynamics and abundance of codling moth butterflies in the past ten years in Croatia the differences in the behaviour of this pest were observed. In the past ten years the appearance and the flight of codling moth butterflies have been monitored by using pheromone traps (Csalomon) always placed in the same position and observed every two days. In this paper data from the 2000, 2008 and 2009 were analyzed. The research results showed earlier appearance of butterflies in the vegetation season (in the 2000 butterflies began appearing in late April, while in 2008 and 2009 they appeared in mid-April). Furthermore, the flight of butterflies in the vegetation seasons in 2008 and 2009 lasted several days more than in 2000. In the last two years, the total number of caught butterflies has increased (2000 - 165 specimens, 2008 - 326 specimens and 2009 - 451 specimens) as well as the maximum daily number of caught butterflies (2000 - 14 specimens, 2008 and 2009 - 33 specimens). The average number of caught butterflies in 2000 was 4.46 specimens, in 2008 - 7.09 specimens and in 2009 - 10.7 specimens. The possible causes for these modifications could be the climate changes that allow better overwintering of pests, longer period of development in the vegetation season or possible modifications in the genetic structure of treated and untreated codling moth specimens evidenced by recent genetic studies.

TI  - Fluctuations of population dynamics model parameters view on the problem of climate change
AB  - In current publication the statistical method of analysis of population time series in considered. This method is based on analysis of dynamics of non-linear ecological model parameter estimations in time, and devoted to investigation of influence of change of weather conditions on population dynamics (on the other words, it is devoted to analysis of climate change from the standpoint of separated population dynamics). Estimations of model parameters were obtained for parts (which contains 12 values each) of initial sample. For the approximation of sub-samples the well-known Kostitzin model of population size changing in time was used. It was used for the approximation of dataset of pine looper moth (Bupalus piniarius L.) dynamics in Germany (total sample size is 58). Estimation of model parameters were obtained with known least squares method. Analyses of tendencies of model parameter estimations showed that there are no reasons for rejecting hypotheses about the equalities of regression line angles to zero. It gives the base for conclusion about the absence of serious change in weather conditions in Germany during analyzing time interval (60 years).

TI  - Effect of different infestation levels of Chilo infuscatellus (Snellen) on quantity and quality parameters of sugarcane
AB  - Population dynamics of sugarcane stem borer on commercial varieties of sugarcane were evaluated. The adults of Chilo infuscatellus (Snellen) emerged from over wintering larvae during fourth week of February. The population of adults of C. infuscatellus remained low in early vegetative growth stage of sugarcane crop. The number of moth/trap increased gradually as the growth of the crop advanced and the maximum population of 37.42.20 was recorded during August. When mean number of 18.98 moth/trap were collected. The population of C. infuscatellus was declined after August and 28.62.42, 14.61.74 moths were captured/trap in month of September and October, respectively. The infestation of sugarcane stem borers was inversely proportional to the quantity and quality of sugarcane. Maximum cane weight of 13.50.21 and 12.10.05 kg were recorded in CPF-237 and Thatta-10 varieties at 0% infestation level, while minimum at 20% infestation (9.30.12 and 8.50.12 kg), respectively. Highest sugar recovery (11.00.08 and 10.20.11%) was observed at 0% infestation while lowest (9.30.12 and 8.50.12%) at 20% infestation in both the varieties.

TI  - Climate change and pests more than climate. / Cambio climtico y plagas algo ms que el clima
AB  - The general consensus in the scientific community about the effects of climate change on pest species is that pests will be mostly favored by the increase in temperatures. This will create a difficult scenario for the maintenance and management of woodlands. In this work we use as an example of this situation the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopea pityocampa), a Mediterranean pest causing severe damages to pine woodlands. This moth already shows a well-known expansion in Europe as a consequence of temperature increase. We propose an integral strategy to face the future management of this pest. Alternatively to control methods based on direct chemical or biological attacks to the insect, we evidence the possibilities of creating prevention strategies based on habitat management. We suggest to increase ecological heterogeneity of pine plantations, which usually have low structural and species diversity. This would result in ecosystems with higher resistance and resilience against not only pests, but also diverse disturbances that would be menacing woodlands in future years.

TI  - The fruit moth population monitoring and control technique in different orchards
AB  - The species composition and occurrence rules of the fruit moths were investigated in jujube and peach orchards using sex pheromone and blacklight traps. The impacts of three effective management strategies for peach fruit moth were also compared in jujube orchard. The results showed that the important pest in jujube orchard are peach fruit moth Carposina sasakii Matsumura, oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta (Busck) and yellow peach moth Conogethes punctiferalis (Guenee). The peach fruit moth has 2 generations annually starting from early June to late September. The relationship between days and the accumulative number complies with the Sigmoid equation. The oriental fruit moth has 4 generations annually starting from late May to late September. The yellow peach moth has 2 generations annually starting from late May to late September. In peach orchard the oriental fruit moth emergences mostly but peach fruit moth and yellow peach moth emergence are seldom. The oriental fruit moth has 4-5 generations annually starting from early May to late September. The average accumulative number of the trapped moths by sex pheromone is 8829 per basin per year. The irrigation and film cover has the best impact on over wintering larva of the peach fruit moth emergences from soil which inhibitory rate is 67%. Compared with irrigation and film cover, grass cover and film cover and earth compaction have less impact on the overwintering larvae.

TI  - Successful application of the baculovirus product Madex for control of Cydia pomonella (L.) in Bulgaria
AB  - The codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella (L.), causes heavy damage in Bulgarian apple orchards. Conventionally treated orchards, were monitored in this study. In spite of numerous chemical treatments, these orchards showed increasing flight densities of CM moths, growing populations of hibernating larvae and rising fruit damage rates. Thus, the control of CM by conventional spraying programmes became ineffective, apparently due to the development of resistance to insecticides. Products based on the Cydia pomonella granulosis virus (CpGV), such as Madex, may provide alternative control tools that can be applied with other approaches, for a sustainable control strategy. The trials were carried out in Central-South and South-East Bulgaria, in 2006-2010. Four treatments of Madex against the first generation, and six treatments against the second generation kept the fruit damage and population density of CM at a low level. Based on the obtained results, different control strategies have been suggested, depending on the initial CM pressure in a particular orchard. Madex may be a promising alternative to traditional programmes of CM control. Its dose, however, should be adjusted to the initial CM population density. Also, at a high or moderate CM population density Madex applications should be combined with MD to avoid resistance of CM to granulovirus. At the peak of CM hatching, additional chemical treatments may be sometimes necessary. Such treatments include using insecticides which are still effective against CM.

TI  - Intraspecific life cycle and larval instar variations among local populations of Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera Crambidea) in the Philippines
AB  - Intraspecific life cycle with emphasis on larval instar variations of six local populations of F2 generation of Asian corn borer (ACB), Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee), was studied. The initial populations were collected from at least four towns of the different regional sites and reared for one generation on artificial diet under room temperature and relative humidity. Results showed that the populations in Laguna and Leyte had the longest life cycle and the shortest were observed on Isabela populations. Significant differences in the larval duration of the different local populations of the ACB were observed with those from Leyte having the longest followed by Laguna ACB, while those from Isabela and South Cotabato had the shortest. Most significant of the results was the absence of the sixth instar larval period or the pre-pupal stage for ACB populations in Isabela, Camarines Sur, South Cotabato and Bukidnon. Pupal duration and pupal length significantly differed among the six local populations of ACB. The observed discrepancy was also reported in previous ACB life history studies. The results showed differences in the length of larval period and number of larval instars and this may be attributed to several factors such as maternal age, quality of the egg, the kind of host or diet as reported by a researcher a few years ago. It is also possible that there may be other populations of Ostrinia in the country. These significant variations in the life cycle, total larval duration and number of larval instars are interesting research areas to pursue in the future. This very basic knowledge will be important in many aspects of ACB control and management.

TI  - Occurrence and supplementary control of Carposina sasakii in mating-disruptor-treated apple orchards
AB  - The emergence of adult males of Carposina sasakii and their periods of fruit infestation were investigated in apple orchards in Iwate Prefecture where the moth species was controlled using a mating disruptor alone as well as with supplementary insecticides. Fruit damage caused by this pest was not observed when supplementary control was applied, although 2 years after supplementary control had ceased, fruit damage increased to 49.7%. In the orchard where severe C. sasakii damage occurred, fruit damage decreased 2 years after supplementary control was applied during the period of adult emergence.

TI  - Colonisation rates of butterflies and macromoths in the southernmost province of Sweden during 1973-2009. / Storfjrilar som kar sin utbredning nytillskotten i storfjrilsfaunan i sydligaste Sverige under perioden 1973-2009
AB  - This study highlights the expansion of butterflies and macromoths occurring in southern Sweden. Recent changes in climate and habitat has been stressed as the main factors influencing changes in species distributions. Climate change implies an increase in temperature and some species are assumed to extend their northern ranges. In this study we compiled information about the first observations of butterflies and macromoths in the province of Scania in southernmost Sweden from 1973 to 2009. In total, 37 species have been found new to the province during this period. Noctuid moths dominate with 22 new species (59% of the total number), probably because they are more mobile compared with other families such as the Geometridae. Three butterfly species have been recorded new to Scania of which two have established reproducing populations and are widely distributed over Scania. Several of the new species occur irruptive and some species have only been found once. Of the 37 new species, approximately 16 have established local reproducing populations in the province. The increasing number of species occurring in Scania may be related to (i) increased temperature resulting in northward range shifts, (ii) increased temperature leading to increased mobility, (iii) an overall increased search effort resulting in more species being found, and (iv) species naturally migrating and searching for new areas to establish in. It is likely that not just one single factor explains the changes in the butterfly and macromoth fauna of Scania but rather a combination of those mentioned above. It is important to monitor changes in species occurrence and abundance, especially when changes in climate and habitat are accelerating. Further studies are required to analyse consequences and patterns of species colonisations and range expansions. Probably, there are more lepidopteran species that risk extinction in Scania than the number of species that are colonising, but such patterns require careful monitoring to ensure that negative trends are detected before species have disappeared.

TI  - The most important early spring defoliators in National Park "Djerdap" and their parasitoids. / Najznaajniji rani defolijatori na podruju Nacionalnog parka "erdap" i njihovi parazitoidi
AB  - Epidemic forest decline has drawn the attention of professional and scientific community even twenty years ago in the National Park "Djerdap". It is still a great danger in the forests of oak in eastern Serbia, and now affects all species of trees in the area. Some of the causes of this dieback are insect defoliators. They are particularly harmful outbreaking defoliators. These include species from the geometrids (Lepidoptera Geometridae), tortricids (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) and noctuids (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) causing damage to buds, shoots and young leaves. The fluctuations of their populations are difficult to predict. Due to the damage that can cause as the primary causes of oak decline, it is necessary to study and monitor their population dynamics. It is important to note the importance of parasitoids as their natural enemies, which reduce the number of their populations. Studies on population dynamics and the diversity of parasitoids of early spring defoliators, undertaken in this area from 2009 to 2011 are an important basis in the prognosis and good management in integrated control of defoliators.

TI  - Changes of species diversity on moth communities at forest fire region in Samcheok, Korea
AB  - We investigated moth communities in Samcheok, Korea, to elucidate the influence of the East Coast Fire in 2000. Moths were collected with UV light traps 4 times a year from 2006 to 2009 at 3 sites Unburned area (Site 1), Surface fire area (Site 2), and Crown fire area (Site 3) sites, respectively. A total of 3,804 individuals belonging to 727 species from 30 families were captured at the 3 study 1,727 individuals of 505 species (27 families) at Site 1, 1,193 individuals of 353 species (24 families) at Site 2, and 885 individuals of 340 species (25 families) at Site 3. Species richness and individuals of Noctuidae, Pyralidae, Geometridae, and Tortricidae were the highest at all 3 sites. All of species richness, individuals, and species diversity (H) were the highest in Site 1 for 4 years. The index of similarity (-Index) was higher between Site 2 and 3 in 2006, while higher between Site 1 and 2 in 2009. Moths were grouped into 16 categories by hosts of the larval stage. Individuals of moths of herbaceous feeding habit continuously decreased at Site 3, but proportion of individuals of tree feeding habits continuously increased. The present results showed that moth communities was relatively recovered according to vegetation change after forest fire and regeneration of moth communities in surface fire area was more faster than in crown fire area.

TI  - How to time the application of pesticides against horse chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, based on captures of funnel type of pheromone traps? / Hogyan idoztsk a vadgesztenyelevl-aknzmoly (Cameraria ohridella) elleni vegyszeres vdekezst a feromoncsapdk fogsi adatai alapjn?
AB  - In contrast to public view, which still consideres necessary to apply pesticides repeatedly in course of the season against the horse chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae), we present examples that a properly timed single control measure in spring offers an environmently more sound alternative solution. These examples obtained by us earlier in course of a Budapest-wide project are presented here, as additives to our former publications. In 2002, the seasonal flight pattern of the first flight of Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) was monitored in four sites in Budapest, Hungary, by means of pheromone trapping. A single control measure using the same pesticide and application technique was performed at two sites, while a third site was kept as control (no applications of pesticides). The abundance of mines was recorded at three occasions later in the season, timed to the development of large-sized mines of the respective generations. At Szilgyi-alley, where the population size of moths was low (487180 mean number of malesS.E./funnel-traps/week, at peak flight, 5 May), the application of pesticide on the subsequent day of peak flight sufficiently controlled the population of the pest for the entire season (3, 4 and 4 mines/100 leaves). On the untreated control site (Korbereki-street), the mean capture at the peak flight, 9 May was 2800900, yielding to the number of mines/100 leaves as follows 24, 51 and 204, respectively. In the Margit-island, the peak flight occurred at 9 May when 20001200 males were trapped. The southern part of the island was treated with pesticide before peak flight, at 29-30 April (captures at 5 May was 733423), while the northern part only at 7-8 May. In the southern part, the number of mines were as follows 2, 3 and 4, while that of the northern part were 25 on the first recording and remained on the same level thereafter. These data indicate that when males are caught en-mass, control measure should be performed without delay, even if the seasonal flight courve is still on the ascendent phase. A week delay in timing of application of pesticide could diminish the effect. A properly timed single spraying in spring could, however, effectively protect the trees for the entire season.

TI  - Blackberry and raspberry, new hosts of the yellow legged clearwing moth, Synanthedon vespiformis what can the recently developed sex attractant offer in monitoring and beyond?
AB  - The yellow-legged clearwing moth, Synanthedon vespiformis L. (Lepidoptera, Sesiidae), a native species to central and South Europe, had been reported to occur on maron (Castanea sativa), as well as rarely on almond (Amygdalus communis) and peach (Prunus persica), while in silviculture on beech (Fagus silvatica), oak (Quercus spp.) and occasionally also on poplar (Populus spp.), willow (Salix spp.) and on some other woody species. Strikingly and unexpectedly, it heavily attacked thornless blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) in 2006 at Ngrd county, Hungary, and since that time it may cause up to 30% death of bushes of some plantations. It was detected en mass also on raspberry (Rubus idaeus) plantations in 2009 in that region, by means of the newly developed sex attractant traps. The objectives of this study were (1) to check whether the same sex attractant is a useful tool for monitoring the flight of various populations of this pest, living on different host plants/habitats (oak, and blackberry), (2) to follow seasonal flight pattern of the pest in various cultivars of blackberry, (3) to determine the circadian rhythm of trap captures and (4) to map the distribution of the pest in Ngrd county. Sticky (RAG) as well as of large capacity, funnel type of pheromone traps (VARL+) (Csalomon, produced by the Plant Protection Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary) were used in course of the season of 2009 (objectives 1 and 4), and further trials have been running in 2010 (objectives 2 and 3). Trapping sites were chosen so that an isolation distance of at least 500 m was kept between various hosts. Results show that the same sex attractant is a useful bait for monitoring for all populations of S. vespiformis, living either in oak forest, or in blackberry plantation, or in raspberry plantation. Significant captures were recorded in plantations of both the "Loch Ness" and "Thornfree" cultivars of blackberry, showing a more-or-less similarly continuous flight in course of the season. Male moth entered the traps predominantly in the afternoon (1500-1900). The pest was abundant in all of the checked black- and raspberry plantations in Ngrd county (Hungary). Effective control measures are needed not just for achieving good yield of berries at harvest, but in blackberries also for preventing die out of bushes. Recently used methods are costy for farmers and require heavy application of pesticides, therefore new, environmentally-sound methods would be needed.

TI  - Potential of using sex pheromone for mating disruption of stored product Pyralidae
AB  - Field trials were carried out in order to evaluate the use of the pheromone TDA, known also as ZETA (Z,E,-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate), for mating disruption of species of Pyralidae that associated with stored products. The trials were conducted in Czech Republic, Greece and Italy, during 2007 and 2008. The facilities tested varied in their size and type, and included flour mills, retail stores, storage rooms with currants and raw grain stores; however, in most cases the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller, and the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hbner). After a pre-treatment monitoring period, during summer period, in order to assess the population of pyralid moths in these facilities, dispensers, containing TDA were placed, until late autumn, when moth presence was extremely low. Adjacent storerooms (or facilities), without dispensers, were used as control units. In all cases, pheromone-baited traps were suspended in order to monitor the population fluctuation of the pyralid moths. The presence of dispensers reduced notably the number of adults found in the traps, in comparison with control storerooms. Monitoring of oviposition by mated females, by recording numbers of larvae in cups containing food, indicated that, there was a reduction in the number of larvae in the areas with dispensers, for both years examined. The results of the present work show that the use of mating disruption is feasible against pyralid moths in storage facilities, and should be further evaluated under the basis of an IPM-based control strategy.

TI  - Five years of continuous Thaumetopoea processionea monitoring tracing population dynamics in an arable landscape of south-western Germany
AB  - Within this paper we summarize the results of the Thaumetopoea processionea monitoring at two observation sites and try to interpret population dynamics from 2006 to 2010 considering meteorological data. Furthermore, observations on the behaviour of neonates associated with oak budburst are presented and discussed. In 2007 large larval colonies occurred and population densities peaked. Massive defoliation and larval migration due to food shortage were observed regularly leading to reduced female moth fecundity. Unfavourable weather conditions probably abetted OPM population decline in spring 2008. Additionally oak budburst was delayed remarkably. More detailed observations on the hatching process and the behaviour of single colonies revealed increasing mortality after two and a half weeks of starvation. The 2009 results indicated another increase of population densities, but exceeded cool and humid weather conditions in May 2010 presumably prevented a new OPM outbreak. In accordance with previous studies egg parasitisation seems to play a minor role in OPM population dynamics.

TI  - The diversity of noctuid moths (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) in National park "Djerdap". / Diverzitet faune tetnih sovica (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) Nacionalnog parka "erdap"
AB  - The paper presents a part of the forest entomology inventory and pest monitoring results during the 3-year research period (2007-2009), conducted within the National park "Djerdap", North-East Serbia. A classical approach standardized for the Macrolepidoptera monitoring programs was applied. Several light trap models were used, as well as Malaise traps. Moths were also collected directly, on street lights, flowers and with wine baited traps. Species abundance, frequency of appearance and corresponding flight periods was obtained with the negligible impact to the fauna, complying to the standards prescribed in the areas of protected nature. Taxonomical identification of the recorded noctuid moths was done according to most relevant and recognized keys, listed in the references. In total, 48 species of potentially harmful Noctuidae species were recorded during the 3-year inventory. By the starting assumption, their harmfulness was derived from the former literature data, as well as rich forest protection, defoliator outbreak history and field experience of local forestry. Out of 286 noctuids known for the area of Djerdap, only the listed 48 were chosen for the purpose of this paper. For all the listed species, place and date of the first record is given, their flight period, food plant and observed frequency (given as number of specimens in various number classes - Table 1). It is concluded that, during the monitoring period none of the recorded species caused damages that could be categorized as harmful for the tree species of their corresponding food plants.

TI  - Noctuid pest species inventory (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) of the National Park "Fruka gora". / Inventarizacija faune tetnih sovica (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) Nacionalnog Parka "Fruka gora"
AB  - The paper presents a part of the forest entomology inventory and pest monitoring results during the 7-year research period (2002-2008) conducted within the National park "Fruka gora" in Syrmia, Northwest Serbia. A classical approach standardized for the Macrolepidoptera monitoring programs was applied. Several light trap models were used as well as Malaise traps. Moths were also collected directly, on street lights, flowers and with wine baited traps. Species abundance, frequency af appearance and corresponding flight periods was obtained with the negligible impact to the fauna, complying to the standards prescribed in the areas of protected nature. Taxonomical identification of the recorded noctuid moths was done according to most relevant and recognized keys, listed in the references. In total, 55 species of potentially harmful Noctuidae species were recorded during the 7-year inventory. By the starting assumption, their harmfulness was derived from the former literature data as well as rich forest protection, defoliator outbreak history and field experience of local forestry. Out of 204 noctuids known for the area of Fruka gora, only the listed 55 were chosen for the purpose of this paper. Comparison with the results of the neighboring Spava forest (Eastern Croatia) where 161 noctuid species were recorded in a multiyear research in the 1970-ies out of which 34 were categorized as potentially harmful (capable to generate outbreaks of various magnitudes). Both in the Croatian side (Spava forest) and National Park "Fruka gora" species from the subfamily Hadeninae and Noctuinae were dominating noctuids. For all the listed species, place and date of the first record is given, their flight period, food plant and observed frequency (given as number of specimens in various number classes - Table 1). It is concluded that, during the monitoring period none of the recorded species caused damages that could be categorized as harmful for the tree species of their corresponding food plants.

TI  - Seasonal abundance and within tree spatial distribution of Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae)
AB  - The citrus leafminer (CLM) Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton 1856 is a widespread pest of citrus. This was a 2-yr study aimed to thoroughly investigate the seasonal population abundance and the within tree distribution of each CLM immature stage in citrus. The seasonal abundance of CLM was monitored by collecting young flush. Each sampled tree was divided into sampling quadrants (north, south, east and west), and two layers (0.5-1.5 m and 1.5-2.5 m) within each quadrant. The population fluctuation pattern indicates that, in the region of the study, CLM completes 4 or 5 overlapping generations annually. The peak population was recorded in October and November. Population densities were much higher in the low than the high strata of the trees, in the second year of the study. Among the different quadrants the CLM population was less frequently recorded in the west part of the trees. Furthermore, seasonality was indicated in the distribution of the pest on the trees. CLM was proved to select less frequently the western part of the trees in autumn, whereas in summer, no preference was recorded. The importance of these results in more effective management programs of this pest is discussed.

TI  - Application of a remote-sensing pheromone trap for analysis of overwintering population of the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta
AB  - A remote sensing pheromone trap called IT pheromone trap (Korean patent 10-0982563) was applied to monitor overwintering population changes of the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta, for three successive years in apple orchards. Males of the overwintering populations were attracted during April and May. However, the occurrence peak was delayed and extended to early June in 2010, at which the average spring temperature was significantly lower than the previous years. These overwintering populations could be monitored by the remote-sensing pheromone trap. When the remote-sensing pheromone traps were deployed to apple orchards of different provinces in Korea in 2010, the maximal overwintering populations of G. molesta were monitored at May in all areas. However, the population sizes monitored were significantly different among different localities. This study suggests a practical application of IT pheromone trap to monitor G. molesta in field conditions.

TI  - Spruce budworm, windthrow and partial cutting do different partial disturbances produce different forest structures?
AB  - Forest management that incorporates the emulation of natural disturbances is promoted as a coarse filter approach to maintaining natural ecosystem functions, yet the initial outcomes of different natural and anthropogenic disturbances of similar severity may be quite different. We question whether a variant of diameter-limit partial harvesting effectively generates structural and compositional patterns similar to those found after spruce budworm outbreaks or windthrow, and whether stands issued from these two partial natural disturbances are more similar to each other or to those resulting from the studied partial harvests. We conducted our study 20-25 years after these partial disturbances occurred to determine whether the patterns converged or diverged over time. Results showed that post-disturbance vegetation distribution and abundance were similar after all partial disturbance types. Tree diameter distribution followed a reverse-J pattern and mean densities of mature trees were similar, although a higher proportion of deciduous species was observed in the partial harvest sites. Snag densities converged among the three partial disturbance types, despite initial differences that likely occurred in snag abundance and differences in the type of mortality (selective tree removal in partial cuts, uprooting/snapping in windthrow and standing mortality after insect outbreaks). The density of moderately decomposed coarse woody debris was significantly lower after partial harvesting relative to after windthrow and spruce budworm disturbances. Although a higher total number of canopy gaps was observed in the sites disturbed by spruce budworm, the percentage of canopy openness was similar among the three partial disturbances. Our results suggest that convergence of structural and compositional components occurred over the 25 year period since the disturbance. Thus after one entry, the studied partial harvests may be reasonable analogs to both of the studied natural disturbances in terms of medium-term post-disturbance species composition and structural complexity.

TI  - Genetic inferences about the population dynamics of codling moth females at a local scale
AB  - Estimation of demographic parameters is important for understanding the functioning of natural populations and the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes that may impact their dynamics. Here, we used sibship assignment methods to shed light on the local dynamics of codling moth females in eight orchards in a 90-ha domain near Valence, France. Based on full-sib inference among 1,063 genotyped moths, we estimated (1) the effective number of females that had offspring, (2) their fertility and (3) the distribution of their oviposition sites within and among orchards. The average number of females in all the orchards increased between the first (~130) and the second (~235) annual generations. The average fertilities of the females were similar at each generation according to the host plant considered (apple, pear, or walnut), but differed between commercial (~10) and non-treated (~25) apple orchards. Females mainly clustered their eggs on contiguous trees along orchard borders, but they also occasionally dispersed their eggs among different orchards independently of the cultivated host plants or the inter-orchard distances (up to 698 m) during the second annual generation. The mean distance between two oviposition sites was 30 m. Sibship estimates of both the effective number of females and the inter-orchard migration rates (~5%) were in agreement with the observed genetic differentiation among the eight orchards (0.006 &lt; Fst &lt;0.013). These results confirm and extend previous field and laboratory observations in Cydia pomonella, and they demonstrate that sibship assignments based on genetic data are an interesting alternative to mark-release-recapture methods for inferring insect population dynamics.

TI  - Population dynamics and seed yield losses by the gram caterpillar (Helicoverpa armigera) in rabi forage legumes
AB  - Gram caterpillar, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Noctuidae Lepidoptera) is a major threat to agriculture in Africa, Asia, Oceania and parts of Europe. The pest has a preference for feeding on the floral parts of host plants especially forage and grain legumes. H. armigera is the key pest of Egyptian clover (Berseem) seed crop in northern India. Other Rabi forage legumes like Persian clover (Shaftal) and alfalfa (Lucerne) also suffer similar damage by H. armigera. The population dynamics and seed yield losses by the pest on popular genotypes of these forage legumes were studied for 3 consecutive years (2006-07 to 2008-09). Across genotypes, H. armigera build up started in standard meteorological week (SMW) 16, reached a peak value of 11.3 larvae/m2 in SMW 19, and declined to a low of 0.4 larvae/m2 in SMW 25. The overall pooled mean larval population was 3.270.034, 2.740.034, 2.560.034, 1.060.034 and 0.330.034/m2 in berseem varieties BL 1, BL 42, BL 10, lucerne variety LLC 5 and shaftal variety S 69, respectively. The avoidable yield losses were highest in Egyptian clover genotypes BL 10 (72.51-74.52%) followed by BL 42 (69.53-71.83%). Alfalfa (LLC 5) and Persian clover (S 69) recorded much lower yield losses of 40.46-45.70% and 25.26-31.10%, respectively. Among the three recommended insecticides, endosulfan 35 EC@ 2.5 l/ha recorded the highest cost-benefit (CB) ratios of 17.6 to 120.9 as compared to 14.8 to 119.8 and 14.0 to 117.5 in case of indoxacarb 15 EC@ 500 ml/ha and spinosad 48 SC@150 ml/ha, respectively.

TI  - Seasonal occurrence and damage of geometrid moths with particular emphasis on Ascotis selenaria (Geometridae Lepidoptera) in citrus orchards in Jeju, Korea
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate Geometridae (Lepidoptera) species as pests and the damage they cause in citrus orchards in Jeju, Korea. Seven geometridae species occurred in citrus orchards Ascotis selenaria, Ectropis excellens, Menophra senilis, Biston panterinaria, Ourapteryx nivea, Odontopera arida and Hypomecis punctinalis. Among them, A. selenaria was most abundant, followed by E. excellens and M. senilis. Most Geometridae larvae fed on citrus leaves, but A. selenaria larvae ate fruits and leaves. Fruit damage of Citrus unshiu appeared as gnawed scars caused by young larvae feeding on fruit surface. Fruit damage on Shiranui fruits appeared as a wide hole or deep scars caused by feeding by mature larvae (6th instar). Citrus leaves damage due to Geometridae larvae was high during May to June. Fruit damage started in late June as the spring-shoots of citrus hardened and increased sharply in late July. In the field experiment, fruit damage in the late season reached 4.2% in both 2008 and 2009 and reached 5.2% in 2010. In citrus orchards, A. selenaria larvae started to appear in mid-May and their populations peaked in mid June, late July, and early to mid-September. Adult males of A. selenaria had a maximum peak in mid-May, and two other peaks in early to late July and late August to early September. A. selenaria male adults were collected in a pheromone traps constantly throughout Jeju Island.

TI  - Five years of mass trapping of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller in a flour mill
AB  - Results of applying the mass trapping method using the synthetic pheromone (Z, E)-9, 12-tetradecadienyl acetate (TDA) to contain the population of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller in a large traditional flour mill are presented. The surveys were carried out over a period of five years to control the infestation and protect the flour mill's output. Forty-two funnel-traps (one every 270 m3), each baited with 2 mg of TDA (daily release of 13 g), were installed in the mill on March 2004 and kept till November 2008; eight additional traps were placed at the exterior of the facility, especially in the wheat silo area and near the loading equipment. In almost five years, the pheromone traps attracted a total of 54,170 male Mediterranean flour moths. Considering only the catch data obtained from the traps located in the internal departments of the mill, 28,360 specimens were captured during 2004, 5,856 in 2005, 8,992 in 2006, 2,235 in 2007, and 2,218 in 2008. Outside the plant, 1,975 males were trapped in 2004, 1,405 in 2005, 1,005 in 2006, 1,010 in 2007, and 1,114 in 2008. From the trap counts obtained it was possible to identify the locations of the main foci of infestation. During the surveys, the continuous presence of pheromone traps in the mill, accompanied with other pest control measures, caused a marked decrease of the Mediterranean flour moth population from 2004 till 2008. The infestation was maintained at a low level, especially during the last two years of the study, when the IPM program applied in the plant didn't include any general fumigation but only localized insecticide treatments and careful cleaning of the various departments (wheat storage bins, processing and packaging areas, milling products warehouses and the loading zone) and of the interior of all equipment. As it is not possible at present to establish the economic injury level of insect infestations in flour mills, there is a need for investigations into how the effectiveness of Integrated Pest Management programs can be evaluated in a sound way.

TI  - Effect of weather parameters on moth catches in pheromone trap for Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) Hardwick infesting tomato
AB  - Field studies were conducted in Rajasthan, India, during the 2009-10 and 2010-11 rabi seasons, to establish a relation between the fluctuations of Helicoverpa armigera male moth catches in pheromone traps and weather parameters that will help in the timely management of H. armigera in tomato. Tomato was grown as a sole crop and the pheromone trap was placed at 1.0 m above ground. The moths trapped were removed and counted at weekly intervals. Data on weather parameters were obtained from the meteorological unit at ARS, Banswara. The relationship between weather parameters and pheromone trap catches was established by using simple correlation and regression analysis. Results showed that pheromone traps provided an efficient tool for estimating fluctuations in population density and indicating adult peaks. A total of 2111 and 822 moths were captured during the first and second years, respectively. Results of the correlation studies revealed that H. armigera populations were greatly influenced by weather conditions. Among the weather parameters, evening relative humidity showed significant negative association with male moth catches during the 2009-10 season. Various weather parameters caused 57 and 40% significant variations in H. armigera male catches in tomato during 2009-10 and 2010-11, respectively.

TI  - Genetic regulation of the olfactory response in the apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella
AB  - The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella, is a seed predator of rowan, Sorbus aucuparia. The rowan fruit production shows large fluctuations in Fennoscandia, Norway, and is low every 2-4 years. In these intermast years, female moths must seek alternative hosts. Apple is the second favored host after rowan, and in years of low rowan fruit production A. conjugella larvae cause significant damage to apples. To identify candidate A. conjugella genes involved in olfaction, a suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) library enriched in antennal transcripts was constructed and characterized. 864 clones from the library were sequenced. From these SSH-sequences, 34% could be identified as putative olfactory genes based on their similarity to known olfactory genes or genes hypothesized to have a function in olfaction. Genes involved in binding and transport of odorants were by far the most abundant olfactory genes in the SSH library, but putative odorant degrading enzymes were well represented. Two sequences were identified as a putative odorant receptor of the ionotropic receptor type. Form the antennae specific SSH library, a putative pheromone binding protein (AconPBP3) was identified. AconPBP3 contains all the sequence characteristics of a lepidopteran PBP and is highly expressed in the antennae of male A. conjugella. A competitive binding assay showed that the protein is able to bind known female produced pheromone components (long chain acetates) of A. conjugella, but not alkanes of similar chain lengths. AconPBP3 is not able to distinguish between the behavioral attractant (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate and the strong antagonist (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol. While AconPBP3 discriminates between alkanes and polar fatty acid or alcohol analogues, it does not contribute to the biologically important selection among the polar groups. AconPBP3 acts as a semi-selective filter in the pheromone detection system. Furthermore, selectivity must be provided by other parts of the system. The circadian clock genes cryptochrome 1 and period from A. conjugella were identified and cloned. If a negative transcriptional feedback loop underlies the circadian clock in A. conjugella, it should drive the rhythmic expression of period. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to study the expression pattern of these clock genes at 4 hour intervals in the antennae, head and body, under different light regimes. Cryptochrome 1 and period were both expressed in antennae, heads and bodies of A. conjugella. By investigating the expression of these genes throughout the day/night cycle we demonstrated the presence of a circadian clock in bodies of A. conjugella. The presence of a circadian clock in the heads were indicated by the circadian fluctuation of cry1 mRNA.

TI  - Current occurrence of the major Lepidoptera pests in the oriental pear orchards in Korea
AB  - We report current occurrence of four major Lepidoptera pests such as, Grapholita molesta Busck, Adoxophyes orana Fischer von Rslerstamm, Archippus breviplicanus, and Carposina sasakii Matsumura, by sex pheromone traps in pear orchards. Grapholita molesta usually shows 4 to 5 adult occurrence peaks each year. The 1st peak was from late April to early May, the 2nd and the 3rd peaks were not clear, and the 4th peak was late August in Pyeongtaek (Central area) in 2009. In Namyangju (central area), the 1st peak occurred early and mid-April, the 2nd peak in mid-May, the 3rd peak was in mid-late June, the 4th peak was from late August to early September. Whereas the peaks in Cheonan (central area) appeared to be of a different pattern from those of the other areas; as 2 peaks in early April and early May. In Asan (central area), the peak in early May was clear, but after that period the peaks were relatively uncertain. In Naju (southern area), the 1st peak was evident in mid-April. The others were comparatively clear in mid-June, late July, and late August to early September. The occurrence peaks of A. orana usually show 3-4 times a year. Four peaks of adult male occurrence in Pyeongtaek in 2009 were in early-late May, mid June-early July, early-late August, and early-mid-September, respectively. The peaks occurred three times in Cheonan but were not clear in Asan because of the relatively few captured moths. The Naju area showed peaks clearly and captured lots of moths in mid-September. C. sasakii exhibits 2 occurrence peaks a year. In Pyeongtaek, the numbers of captured moths increased from early June to early July in 2009. After that, occurrence was low but the 2nd peak was shown from mid-July to late August. In Cheonan, the occurrence pattern was different in 2007-2009. The C. sasakii occurrence was low in the Asan area and peaks showed in mid-June and late August. The occurrence in Naju tended mainly to be in mid-late June and August. A. breviplicanus adults occurred 2-3 times a year. The number of captured moths was relatively low in all surveyed areas.

TI  - Invasion species Coleophora laricella - one of the main limiting factor of Larix decidua during the forest aforestation and recultivation
AB  - Coleophora laricella Hbner, 1817 was introduced in Serbia along with Larix decidua Miller, 1768 (commonly used in the recultivation processes by reforestation) and as a result of the great adaptive ability, it was well-adapted to the site conditions, which differed greatly from the ones within the limits of its nature spread. It is very obstinate and harmful forest insect. In suitable places it has a permanent fluctuation, and in artificial stands the outbreak can last for as long as 12 years, which was confirmed in the common larch cultures established in 1981 at the waste disposal sites of the waste-rock of energy-industrial complex Kolubara, where it started in 1992 and lasted for 15 years. The chemical aerial suppression was conducted in 1996, and the success was complete, but short-lived. However, in the subsequent years, until 2007, the number of the larch casebearer was still above the critical one. The parasitic complex (10 species) was not sufficient for the significant reduction of the population level of the host. The multi-annual consecutive defoliation caused the significant reduction of the current and total increment of the common larch trees, as well as the increase of the intensity of their desiccation.

TI  - Phenological and faunistic contribution in Cretan butterflies (Lepidoptera). / Ein Beitrag zur Phnologie und Faunistik kretischer Schmetterlinge (Lepidoptera)
AB  - Results on Lepidoptera from a light-trapping collection at two sites in the island of Crete over a period of two years are presented. Several phenological types were noticed, as stenochronous species with one, two or three annual generations, and year-round present species with different maxima, some of which may be opportunistic and migratory. Phenology diagrams are presented for 117 species. A list of all identified species is given. One striking result is that most stenochronous univoltine species are actively flying approximately 60 days later than in Central Europe. Auchmis detersa was the only exception since it flies in summer at the same time as in Central Europe. The time between the flight maximum of the two generations in bivoltine species is more than twice as long (120-200 days, average 168 days) as comparable species in Central Europe (55-85 days, average 69 days). In Hoplodrina ambigua, the only species in this category which can be directly compared, has a distance between the maximum in flight periods of 145 days in Crete but only 85 days in Central Europe. Therefore, stenochronous species are most likely "avoiding" the summer period in Crete. However, some opportunistic and possibly migratory species may be present in large numbers in summer, but others occur only in very small abundance during this period.

TI  - Pest status and prevalence of tomato moth Tuta absoluta (Meyrick 1917) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) in tomato growing greenhouses of Mersin. / Mersin ili domates seralarnda Domates yaprak galeri gvesi Tuta absoluta (Meyrick, 1917) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae)'nn yaygnlg ve zarar durumu
AB  - Survey study was carried out in tomato greenhouses of Mersin province during autumn 2009 (september-january) and spring 2010 (february-june) in order to determine the pest status and prevalence of Tomato moth, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick, 1917) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) a new pest for Turkey. In each greenhouse randomly chosen at least 20 plants were controlled successively. Galleries drilled by T. absoluta were searched, plant was registered as infected, if larvae found. A total of 262 greenhouses from 3 locations (Adanaloglu, Kazanl and Kocahasanl) were checked weekly. No T. absoluta was recorded in any 82 greenhouses checked during Autumn 2009 season. T. absoluta was recorded for the first time on 29th April 2010 in a tomato greenhouse in Adanaloglu location. After that date the pest was spread out very fast and recorded in 72 of totally 88 greenhouses checked in Adanaloglu, Kazanl and Kocahasanl during Spring 2010 season. While infested plant rate was low in first week of may, than after increased in late may and early june. The higher infested tomato fruit rate per plant was recorded as 38.4%.

TI  - Peach twig borer moth (Anarsia lineatella, Zeller), significant pest in almond plantations in the area of Herzegovina. / Breskvin moljac (Anarsia lineatella, Zeller) znaajan tetnik u nasadima badema na podruju Hercegovine
AB  - The area of Herzegovina offers ideal conditions for growing different fruit crops. Even though this area is famous for peach, nectarine, cherry and apricot, almond plantations have been established recently as well. Peach twig borer moth has occurred in these almond plantations as important shoot pest, which hasn't been recorded before in the area of Herzegovina. Although this pest is reported to be appearing in peach and nectarine orchards exclusively, it has also attacked shoots in almond orchards in Herzegovina. On the other hand, during the pest monitoring and obligatory sanitary nursery examination this pest has been reported on the peach and nectarine shoots. The official threshold is 2% and we have never found more than 2% in the nursery. However, the peach twig borer moth hasn't been reported as shoot pest of the almond seedlings in the nursery, but was found in the almond shoots in the production orchard in the area of Gnojnice. We are going to present a young almond orchard (3 or 4 years old), with five different varieties and total number of one hundred and ten trees. The examination of trees and almond sprouts on the presence of peach moth larvae was made four times in 2010; 110 trees and 200 sprouts were observed during each examination. In our paper we are going to present the basic morphological variety characteristics, pest biology, localities of the pest monitoring, intensity of pest occurring and damage of almond shoots in 2010 as well.

TI  - Outdoor trapping and genetical characterization of populations of the webbing clothes moth Tineola bisselliella (Lepidoptera Tineidae) in the broader area of Berlin
AB  - Adapted and effective pest management strategies for the protection of irreplaceable culture heritage as well as for the prevention of damages in house-holds and warehouses are based on reliable information about the presence and distribution of the pest organisms. Monitoring the webbing clothes moth Tineola bisselliella at thirteen outdoor stations in the broader area of Berlin give a first idea of their occurrence in an urban area and the hinterlands. The results demonstrate a seasonal abundance in the city and a missing of this species in the countryside. Data suggest a synanthropic occurrence of the webbing clothes moth rather than an invasion from natural reservoires. Possible molecular examinations on the species and subspecies level are presented to analyze the gene flow between populations and give an impression of species mobility as well as pathways of infestation.

TI  - Seasonal population trend of Brinjal shoot and fruit borer, Leucinodes orbonalis Guen (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in Manipur
AB  - The seasonal Population trend of Brinjal shoot and fruit borer, Leucinodes orbonalis Guen on Solanum melongena L. var. Pusa kranti was studied during the two consecutive cropping seasons (2003 & 2004). The population trend of brinjal shoot and fruit borer commenced from 2nd week of April in both the cropping seasons (2003 & 2004) with the initial population of 9.5 and 10.12% during 2003 and 2004, respectively. It gradually increased and revealed its peak density (21.13% in 2003 and 30.11% in 2004) in the 3rd week of May. But, the pest incidence on fruit was observed a week later than shoot infestation in the third week of April (11.20% in 2003 and 11.19% in 2004). It increased steadily and achieved a peak (44.16% in 2003 and 68.12% in 2004) in the second week of the June. The correlation studies revealed that average relative humidity and temperature showed significant positive influence while sunshine observed significant negative influence on the infestation of L. orbonalis on brinjal.

TI  - Is insecticide spraying a viable and cost-efficient management practice to control pine processionary moth in Mediterranean woodlands?
AB  - Insect pests are a major threat to many forests worldwide, from boreal to tropical forest ecosystems. Some pests exhibit periodical outbreaks, after which their populations often crash as a result of natural biological control. To offset such outbreaks, several management techniques are used, including aerial spraying of insecticides. The question remains whether pest decline following an outbreak is the result of management practices or a natural consequence of the insect's population cycle. In this study, we assessed the performance of aerial spraying of insecticides on pine woodland stands to control pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (PPM) outbreaks in southern Spain. To achieve this, we compared the degree to which a forest stand recovers from defoliation from one year of severe damage by PPM to the following year (infestation index) in stands that were treated (i.e. subjected to aerial spraying) and untreated using a 4-years database from the Regional Environmental Council. The results revealed a significant similar recovery from infestation after a PPM outbreak of both sprayed and non sprayed pine woodland stands, for the four most representative pine species (black, Aleppo, maritime, and stone pine). It is concluded that insecticide spraying cannot be considered a prevention for outbreaks if it is applied once the outbreak explodes. Management practices that can help control PPM outbreaks include promoting spatial heterogeneity at the landscape level, fostering biodiversity in pine plantations, and reinforcing parasitoid insect and predatory bird populations that negatively affect the PPM. This study illustrates how simple sampling designs and statistical tests can be useful decision-making tools and can help improve the environmental viability and cost-efficiency of forest management practices.

TI  - Downy, powdery mildew and botrytis risk assessment by climate parameters, pest and spores monitoring in Rioja Alavesa vineyard (Northwest of Spain)
AB  - The integrated production Regulation for grapevine in the Basque Country was published in 2004 (BOPV 221/2004, official bulletin). A previous 3-year study was carried out to evaluate the real situation of growers to assume this regulation in their exploitations. Several deficiencies were reported, including technical and management aspects. This work is focused in Rioja Alavesa, an area with 12,869 ha of vineyard in the Northwest of Spain producing 81,325,000 wine grape kilo. Integrated disease control interest is rising, although the number of fungicides applications in the last two years against downy mildew and other fungal diseases reached up to 12 treatments, being usual 5 or 6 per season. These data prompted us to implement the strategy of fungal disease control. We installed 12 monitoring weather stations in different trials, according to different environment and geographical characteristics. The stations were equipped with sensors of temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, soil temperature, radiation sensors, rain gauge, and an anemometer. Registered data can be discharged and recuperated from internet, at the same time that the risk assessment for downy and powdery mildew and botrytis diseases. In parallel, one sticky glass trap to capture spores by impact was installed near each station and two more traps in each field. Pheromone traps to capture Lobesia botrana were also distributed in the fields close to the spore traps, as the abundance of this insect gives an idea of the possible future botrytis damages and spread. After these assays we would be able to validate the stations for each studied zone and assure that the risk assessment made by climate parameters follows a real model, taking into account the disease incidence in the field as well as the spore and vector populations.

TI  - Influence of onion planting date on Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) larvae population in Northern Burkina Faso
AB  - Objective Onion is the main vegetable produced in Northern Burkina Faso. Since 2005, the prices have increased over threefold leading to an increase in production areas and the number of annual cycles. The intensified production has led to invasion of the crop by Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner 1808) larvae, which is the main insect pest in the area. The aim of this study was to impede the invasion of H. armigera larvae, focusing on the effect of farming period and the locality of production. Methodology and results A survey was carried out in twenty peasants' farms in 4 localities from September to December 2010 Data were collected by counting the larvae found on the onion fronds. The number H. armigera larvae revealed that the proliferation was more intense in the plantations during September as compared to December. Similarly, the average weight of the bulbs and the yields depended on the number of larvae and the date of planting. The yields were 19 t.ha-1 versus 30 t.ha-1 for the plantations established in September and December, respectively. Conclusion and application of results Based on the results, a month long period of dead vegetation (plants) before planting is useful to allow a reduction in the number of fertile adults of H. armigera after the end of the cereal cycle.

TI  - Stem injection of a systemic insecticide to control Uraba lugens on urban Lophostemon confertus trees
AB  - BACKGROUNDUraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera Nolidae) has the potential to become a serious pest of susceptible forestry and urban trees in New Zealand. Stem injection of insecticides provides a method for the control of U. lugens in public locations where foliar applications are not suitable. Field and laboratory studies were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to determine a dose response profile of U. lugens larvae to acephate injected at 0.0, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 g cm-1 tree diameter measured at breast height (dbh). The concentration of the injected solution varied across years. RESULTS The highest mortality (85-100%) of U. lugens larvae occurred at 1.00 g acephate injected cm-1 dbh. The lower rates (0.25 and 0.50 g acephate cm-1) were more effective in 2010 than in 2009, a factor attributed to the change in volume of injected solution. CONCLUSION Systemic injections of acephate at rates above 0.50 g cm-1 dbh provide a tool for the management of U. lugens in public places. It is recommended that stem injection operations for control of U. lugens larvae be timed to coincide with the emergence of first instars so that larvae are exposed to lethal insecticide doses.

TI  - A new outbreak of Loxostege sticticalis reproduction in the Novosibirsk region
AB  - New outbreak of mass reproduction of meadow moth (Loxostege sticticalis) occurred in 2009 in Novosibirskaya region. According to all accounts, it was initiated this time by flight of moths from the West. According to the research carried out by specialists from the local Plant Protection Service in the region last year there has been formed a significant overwintering pest population, which, as it was assumed, will increase significantly numbers of the local moth population in 2010. This prediction went true. As it was expected, adults' flight in the preferred by the pest habitats was determined as low to high and mass. However, summer weather conditions did not favour the pest development. Forecasts in relation to the local moth population in 2011 appear to be optimistic as well.

TI  - Damage on oak after insect infestation and mildew infection in Lower and Middle Franconia. / Eichenschden in Unter- und Mittelfranken nach Insektenfrass und Mehltaubefall
AB  - In Lower and Middle Franconia, oak processionary moth populations (Thaumetopoea processionea L.) have achieved high densities during recent years. In the years 2009 and 2010, we observed a steady increase in defoliated or dead oaks. These damages may be due to green oak tortrix and oak processionary moth infestation associated with oak powdery mildew infection. Relationships with forest management practices and stand structure are discussed.

TI  - Quantification of C uptake in subarctic birch forest after setback by an extreme insect outbreak,
AB  - The carbon dynamics of northern natural ecosystems contribute significantly to the global carbon balance. Periodic disturbances to these dynamics include insect herbivory. Larvae of autumn and winter moths (Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata) defoliate mountain birch (Betula pubescens) forests in northern Scandinavia cyclically every 9-10 years and occasionally (50-150 years) extreme population densities can threaten ecosystem stability. Here we report impacts on C balance following a 2004 outbreak where a widespread area of Lake Tornetrsk catchment was severely defoliated. We show that in the growing season of 2004 the forest was a much smaller net sink of C than in a reference year, most likely due to lower gross photosynthesis. Ecosystem respiration in 2004 was smaller and less sensitive to air temperature at nighttime relative to 2006. The difference in growing season uptake between an insect affected and non-affected year over the 316 km2 area is in the order of 29103 tonnes C equal to a reduction of the sink strength by 89%.

TI  - Evidence of selection at melanin synthesis pathway loci during silkworm domestication
AB  - The domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori) was domesticated from wild silkworm (Bombyx mandarina) more than 5,000 years ago. During domestication, body color between B. mandarina and B. mori changed dramatically. However, the molecular mechanism of the silkworm body color transition is not known. In the present study, we examined within- and between-species nucleotide diversity for eight silkworm melanin synthesis pathway genes, which play a key role in cuticular pigmentation of insects. Our results showed that the genetic diversity of B. mori was significantly lower than that of B. mandarina and 40.7% of the genetic diversity of wild silkworm was lost in domesticated silkworm. We also examined whether position effect exists among melanin synthesis pathway genes in B. mandarina and B. mori. We found that the upstream genes have significantly lower levels of genetic diversity than the downstream genes, supporting a functional constraint hypothesis (FCH) of metabolic pathway, that is, upstream enzymes are under greater selective constraint than downstream enzymes because upstream enzymes participate in biosynthesis of a number of metabolites. We also investigated whether some of the melanin synthesis pathway genes experienced selection during domestication. Neutrality test, coalescent simulation, as well as network and phylogenetic analyses showed that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene was a domestication locus. Sequence analysis further suggested that a putative expression enhancer (Abd-B-binding site) in the intron of TH gene might be disrupted during domestication. TH is the rate-limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis pathway in insects. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay did show that the relative expression levels of TH gene in B. mori were significantly lower than that in B. mandarina at three different developmental stages, which is consistent with light body color of domesticated silkworm relative to wild silkworm. Therefore, we speculated that expression change of TH gene may contribute to the body color transition from B. mandarina to B. mori. Our results emphasize the exceptional role of gene expression regulation in morphological transition of domesticated animals.

TI  - Evaluation of biocidal efficacy of botanicals against tomato fruit borer (Helicoverpa armegera Hubner) at field level
AB  - Biocidal effect of botanicals was found significant in managing tomato fruit borer of winter crop in Allahabad condition. Lowest fruit borer infestation (5.84%) was recorded in NSKE followed by (7.13%) in NLE, (8.44%) in TLE and (9.08%) in OGBE respectively. Highest infestation (27.49%) was observed in control. Minimum fruit damage (7.73%) was recorded in NSKE while maximum (29.05%) in control. Plant vigor was also found to be influenced by botanicals application. Plant height, number of branches per plant, number of flower clusters per plant and number of fruit set per plant were recorded maximum (62.39 cm, 12.43, 83.45, 32.47) in NSKE while minimum (52.39 cm, 8.44, 69.43, 20.84) in control respectively. Insignificant effect among the botanicals for vigor parameters were observed while highly significant effect was showed in relation to control. Highest fruit yield (36.98 t/ha) was recorded in NSKE which was 73.28% more over control. Next best results were observed in NLE (34.34 t/ha) and TLE (32.98 t/ha). Lowest yield (21.34 t/ha) was observed in control. Net gain over control was maximum (Rs 75,850) in NSKE followed by (Rs 63,750) in NLE. The ICBR indicated that NLE (151.00), OGBE (150.81), CLE (147.22) and TLE (147.112) were most economic treatments. Precisely it may concluded that NSKE at 5% applied five times at fort night interval after one month of planting to get minimum fruit infestation and damage, maximum fruit yield and maximum net gain over control. In respect to ICBR wide range of botanicals may be chosen for the purpose.

TI  - Climate change in Norway warm summers limit grouse reproduction
AB  - Grouse and vole numbers may peak after peaks in the seed crop of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) because of reduced levels of feeding deterrents in bilberry plants. We predicted that grouse reproduction depends also on summer (June-September) temperatures in the 2 previous years, because bilberry plants will be less exhausted after a high seed crop in or after warm summers, and thus rebuild their chemical defence more quickly. After berry peak years, population indices of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) and bank vole (Myodes glareolus) in southern Norway were negatively related to summer temperatures in the previous year or previous 2 years. Willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) chick production in five areas in Norway was negatively related to summer temperatures in the 2 previous years when controlling for vole density. A similar pattern was found for the bilberry-feeding moth (Eulithis populata), an important prey for grouse chicks. In eastern Norway, autumn densities of capercaillie and black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) were more likely to peak in vole peak years at high altitudes, where summer temperatures are low. We conclude that high summer temperatures may limit grouse reproduction through the effect on bilberry plants and that a warm climate thus adversely affects population levels of grouse.

TI  - Population dynamics of Anarsia lineatella and their relation to crop damage in Northern Greece IPM peach orchards towards the development of EIL
AB  - The peach twig borer Anarsia lineatella Zeller (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae) is one of the major economic pests of stone fruits worldwide (Balachowsky et Mesnil 1935, Jones 1935, Bailey 1948, Summers 1955, Balatchowsky 1966, Damos and Savopoulou-Soultani 2008a). In Northern Greece, a great variety of peach (Prunus persica) cultivars (early, middle and late ripening, table and industrial) are cultivated and exported worldwide, so that peach production is considered to be essential for the economy. Efforts are made to improve pest control using Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in order to achieve high standards in products. In northern Greece, A. lineatella has 3 or usually 4 generations per year depending on prevailing temperatures (Damos and Savopoulou-Soultani 2007). During the past few years A. lineatella has been increasingly damaging to peach cultivation and, along with Grapholitha molesta (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), they have been key targets for implementation of effective control strategies in terms of IPM in northern Greece. Larvae feed primarily on buds and tender shoots of the host tree after emergence from hibernacula, where they overwinter as larvae (Balachowsky et Mesnil 1966, Damos and Savopoulou-Soultani 2008b). Sustainable crop productions try to minimize energy input flows in agroecosystems in order to maintain a long term benefit for all enabling parts agroecosystems, biodiversity, farmers, consumers, as well as society in general. As far as specific plant protection strategies are concerned, it is common sense that the application of insecticides would also lead to better pest management and to lower production cost only when economically justified. However, early warning and forecasting systems, which are indispensable in pest management strategies, have not been fully developed for A. lineatella in peach orchards. What is not clear is the population density of these species sufficient to cause economic injury to the plant. Under this framework, field studies were conducted for three successive years (2005, 2006 and 2007) in peach orchards of northern Greece in order to examine relationships between densities of A. lineatella populations and peach (Prunus persica) yields. Moreover, natural populations of A. lineatella were observed in order to assess crop response to the presence of the pest. Field population dynamics of A. lineatella were evaluated by using indirect measures (i.e. adult moth flight using pheromone traps), while injury on plant and fruit damage were estimated by absolute measures (i.e. counting injury on shoots as well as on fruits caused by larvae during the season). Regression analysis was used, first to determine if injury could be predicted from A. lineatella males captured on pheromone traps and second, if early shoot flagging caused by larvae of the first generation was correlated with fruit damage of the forthcoming generations (Knight and Croft 1987, Knight and Hull 1989, Savopoulou et al. 1989). Numbers of moths captured on sex pheromone traps and fruit damage varied during the 3 years of observation, ranging from 50 to 250 individuals per trap (F=5.563, df=2.11, P&lt;0.05 and F=50.299, df=2.11, P&lt;0.05, for first and second flight respectively). Shoot flagging and fruit damage was significantly lower in 2006 when compared to 2005 and 2007 (F=2.772, df=2.11, P&lt;0.05 and F=14.809, df=2.11, P&lt;0.05, for shoot flagging and fruit damage respectively). Mean shoot strike injury ranged from 5-15%, while fruit damage levels ranged from 5-10% during the three years of observation. According to the linear model, the increase in moth density during the first flight should result in a significant reduction in yield (y=0.436x+10.22, R2=0.635, P&lt;0.05). Regression of male moths captured during the second flight and observed yield loss was also significant (y=0.5231x+17.204, R2=0.792, P&lt;0.05). Moreover, according to the linear model derived by counting the number of shoot strikes, during the first observation period, a forthcoming yield loss can be estimated (y=27.389x-6.304, R2=0.711, P&lt;0.05). Finally, a significant relationship was also observed between the numbers of second generation larvae and yield loss (y=163x, R2=0.890, P&lt;0.05). The slope from the above regression can be used in the calculation of EIL and the fixed ET (Higley and Pedigo 1993, 1996). Results suggest that relative damage on fruits caused by A. lineatella can be estimated using either male trap captures or by observing early shoot flagging symptoms. Additionally, pesticides should not be applied if population of A. lineatella causing damage is lower than management cost. Developing a relationship between pest abundance and damage to crops is essential for the calculation of EIL leading to informed management decisions.

TI  - Species composition and species diversity of moths (Lepidoptera) on Quercus mongolica forests sand Pinus densiflora forests, in Korean National Long-term Ecological Research Sites (Mt. Nam, Mt. Jiri, Mt. Wolak)
AB  - Moths were collected using a 22W UV black light trap in June through September in 2005 and May, June, August and September in 2006. The study sites were Namsan (Mt. Nam), Jirisan (Mt. Jiri), Woraksan (Mt. Worak) which are part of the Korean National Long Term Ecological Research (KNLTER). There were two common forest communities, Quercus mongolica and Pinus densiflora. The purpose of this study was to compare species diversity of the major plant feeding Lepidoptera in the two forest types at the regional KNLTER sites. We collected a total of 435 species from the KLTER sites in 2005 and 2006. Abundance of moths was highest at Woraksan (Mt. Worak) followed by Jirisan (Mt. Jiri). The Namsan (Mt. Nam) site had the lowest, with five families (Arctiidae, Geometridae, Noctuidae, Notodontidae, and Pyralidae). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed statistically significant differences at sampling date in species abundance as a response variable and at site in species richness as another response variable. Although we expected a distinct cluster with the forest type at each study site, one of ordination analyses, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS), showed distinct clusters with the moth assemblages at each site only but NMS did not show any distinct cluster with the different forest types at each site as we expected.

TI  - Genetic variability of geographical populations of the bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hbner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), in west and northwest of Iran
AB  - Old World or African bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hbner (Lep. Noctuidae) is one of the key pests causing severe yield losses, infesting several crops such as cereals, pulses, cotton, vegetables and fruit crops as well as wild hosts, ft is expected that the recognition of intraspecific variation, its nature and scope, may aid our understanding of the pest and also to predict its spatial and temporal occurrence, to devise effective management strategies, and also to characterize pod borer population responses to control measures. The purpose of this study is to estimate the relative importance of generic and environmental effects on characters of pod borer in Iran. Specimens were collected from several provinces in Iran from tomato. The genomic DNA from H. armigera larvae collected during summer 2006-2007 from five different places were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 10 different SSR primers. The highest numbers of 14 markers were produced by the primer HaSSR1, followed by 9 markers by HaSSR6 with high degree of polymorphism 75-100%. The primers HaSSR6, HaSSR4, HaC87 and HaD47 were found to be highly informative to differentiate populations with a polymorphism information content value of 100 percent. Ten tested SSR primers produced 46 bands in geographical populations. Within population genetic diversity based on Nie s gene index ranged from 0.188 to 0.250 Molecular variance analysis showed significant within and between population variance. The between and within geographical variance accounted for 13.88 and 86.12 percent of total molecular variance, respectively. Cluster analysis based on molecular data in geographical assigned the studied pod borer moth populations into two groups. In this grouping, group one consisted of Golestan population. The maximum and minimum genetic distances were observed between Gorgan-Mughan (0.21853) and Kermanshah-Shahindej (0.05789). Significant correction was not found between genetic and geographic matrices revealed by Mantel test.

TI  - Population dynamics of Helicoverpa armigera on chick pea, pigeon pea and cotton in correlation with weather parameters
AB  - Field experiments were conducted in Haryana, India, in 2006-07, to study the population dynamics of Helicoverpa armigera in chickpea, pigeon pea and cotton crops based on weather parameters. H. armigera was active from the last week of July to the end of October in cotton. During this period, the insect population fluctuated with 3 peaks. The pest incidence started during the last week of july and increased from 5.0 to 6.3 larvae/10 plants during the first week of August. The population decreased during the second and third weeks of August and increased and reached its peak (14.8 larvae/10 plants) during the first week of September. During September, the pest population showed a fluctuating trend. However, the second peak of the insect population was observed during the first week of October (16.0 larvae/10 plants). The highest population (21.3 larvae/10 plants) was recorded during the third week of October. In pigeon peas, the H. armigera larval population was observed from the third week of August to the first week of November and fluctuated from 0.7 to 4.8 larvae/10 plants. The population gradually increased, the highest population (4.8 larvae/10 plants) were recorded during the third week of September, gradually declined during the last week of September and remained almost static thereafter. In chickpeas, the H. armigera larval population started during the third week of November. The highest population (9.2 larvae/10 plants) was recorded during the second week of March and gradually decreased. The pest was active from November to March on this crop. In chickpea, minimum temperature, rain, vapour pressure and relative humidity in the morning and evening were positively correlated with the increase in H. armigera population. In cotton, the population fluctuation was negatively correlated with the maximum and minimum temperatures and vapour pressure in the morning and evening. The decrease in these parameters resulted in population increase.

TI  - Effect of pheromone dispenser density on timing and duration of approaches by peachtree borer
AB  - The timing and duration of approaches by male peachtree borer Synanthedon exitiosa Say (Lepidoptera Sesiidae) to commercial pheromone dispensers placed singly or at high density in peach orchards was determined by using field-deployed video cameras and digital video recorders. Cameras were trained on one dispenser, and one standard lure was placed in a peach orchard, and on 12 dispensers in a separate orchard where dispensers for mating disruption had been placed at 371 per hectare. Male moth approaches were video recorded at the peak of peachtree borer annual flight, from 13 to 18 August 2009. The mean approach timing (hminsecSD) during the study period was 113312004643, 114352004558, and 114121004554 AM with the single dispenser, high-density dispensers, and lure, respectively. Day-to-day variability in approach timings suggested that there were no biologically significant differences among treatments. The frequency distribution of approach durations varied among treatments, as the high-density dispensers had mostly short approaches, while the distribution of approaches to the single dispenser and lure was wider. The median (interquartile range) approach duration was 3 (2-4), 1 (1-2), and 4 (2-6) seconds with the single dispenser, high-density dispensers, and lure, respectively. The relative rank of median approach durations was constant throughout the period, indicating differences among treatments. This study showed that the presence of pheromone dispensers for mating disruption did not cause an advancement of peachtree borer diel rhythm of response. Shorter approaches to dispensers placed at high density than singly suggest that dispenser retentiveness is not constant with peachtree borer, which may bias estimates of disruption activity as a function of dispenser density.

TI  - Larval instars determination for the European Grapevine Moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) based on the frequency distribution of head-capsule widths
AB  - Morphological measurements such as head-capsule (HC) width can be very useful and accessible tools that may be employed for classifying Lepidopteran larval instars according to stage of life history. The availability of such measures is crucial in the management of larval pests, because their control relies upon making accurate assessment of the life history stage at which larvae has reached in various environmental conditions. Such forecasts are then used in order to estimate the timing of emergence for future adult populations. Previous studies investigated the use of head-capsule widths from field larvae of European Grapevine Moth (EGVM), Lobesia botrana Den. and Schiff., to describe the distributions of the five instars during three generations of the insect. The observations were performed in 1998 and 2002 in a vineyard near Bordeaux. The results presented here increase the scope of earlier methods by providing statistical confidence. Our method was calibrated on a large number of individuals (N=552) issued from our insect culture and uses a nonlinear least-squares parameter estimation to describe the distribution of each larval instar inside each generation. The model was tested on a wild larval population (n=3007) occurring in our experimental vineyard during two complete years. The instar class ranges and boundaries were characterized with the associated probabilities of misclassification. A final classification statistical model is developed for each instar and each generation. From this study, we conclude that larval HC sizes increase statistically according to the generation of the year, and thus is influenced by grape phenology. The statistical tool may be easily used either by technicians or scientists to determine the larval phenological development of wild populations of the EGVM. The extension of the model to other moths is discussed.

TI  - The abundance of the nun moth and lappet moth larvae on trees of different trunk thickness in Scots pine stands in the Notec forest complex. / Liczebnoc gasienic brudnicy mniszki i barczatki sosnwki na drzewach o rznej gruboci w drzewostanach sosnowych Puszczy Noteckiej
AB  - The size of trees varies in forests, even even-aged monocultures, and this heterogeneity may affect insect pest preferences. This paper presents the results of a study on the abundance of nun moth (Lymantria monacha) and lappet moth (Dendrolimus pini) larvae which is dependent on the thickness of Scots pine tree trunks in five forest districts in the Notec forest complex located in western Poland. Sticky bands were installed on groups of three nearby trees of different trunk thickness categories (tree groups ABC A - trunk thicker-, B - equal to-, and C - thinner- than the average, in a stand) in stands of different age classes, and the number of larvae trapped between 2003 and 2007 was counted. There was a significant difference in the number of larvae on trees of different thickness categories within each stand age class, when these were compared using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. These differences persisted across almost all forest districts, but mainly occurred in pine stands of age class IV (61-80 years old), which was the best represented in the samples of ABC tree groups. In these stands, there were 12.1-37.8 and 21.2-105.3 nun moth larvae/tree, and 1.9-44.3 and 3.7-78.0 lappet moth larvae/tree, on trees from categories C and A, respectively. Thus, the thicker the tree trunk, the higher the number of larvae of either species present below the sticky bands. Significant differences between stands of different age classes in the numbers of larvae below the sticky bands within each of three thickness categories were only present for D. pini in one forest district. The highest mean number of larvae (78, 58 and 44.3 larvae/tree on A, B and C trees, respectively) occurred on trees of age class IV in each tree thickness category, whilst the lowest abundance of larvae (40.7, 22.9 and 15.2 larvae/tree, respectively) was in stands of age class III (41-60 years old). Larval abundance for both insect species directly depended on tree thickness, indicating some preference for large trees by L. monacha and possibly D. pini females for oviposition, and by D. pini larvae migrating in spring from forest litter into tree crowns for feeding. This dependence was apparent only when the number of larvae on trees of the same age class were compared, thus it was not related to differences in tree thickness due to tree age. Given the possible reasons behind insect preferences, we suggest that (a) thinning of Scots pine stands is conducted to leave the most homogeneous stand structure of trees possible, with respect to their thickness (trunk size) to minimise a potential increase of L. monacha and D. pini population density, (b) more than three trees per stand are monitored using sticky bands during the early spring to estimate abundances of both insect species, and (c) an equal proportion of trees from each thickness category is examined during the spring; this will allow foresters to avoid over- or underestimation of population densities and, in consequence, the threat posed by these insect pests.

TI  - Monitoring on the distribution and dynamics of flight of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella Zell.) in Bulgaria
AB  - The potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella Zeller) is widely spread and it is well known as a potato pest among the tropical and subtropical regions. The area of distribution of the species extends northwards. Pheromone traps are used to monitor potato tuber moth population and its distribution in Bulgaria on potato and tobacco crops. During the investigation is established an extension of the potato tuber moth distribution in the country and new areas of invasion are determined. The moths of overwintering generation start flight in April. In the seasonal flight dynamics in the plain regions an increase of the population density is observed during July, August, October and November in tobacco crops and in potato crops in the end of vegetation period during August-September. In the mountain regions the flight starts later and the density of the population was lower.

TI  - Predation on exuded sap-dependant arthropods by the larvae of oriental carpenter moth, Cossus jezoensis (Matsumura) (Lepidoptera, Cossidae) preliminary observations
AB  - Factors of long-term sap-exudation from deciduous Quercus trees have not been clarified. The authors conducted field surveys to elucidate the factors at 11 locations in central Kagawa Prefecture, Shikoku Island, Japan. Sap-exuding trees were found in thirty-five of 764 Q. acutissima trees, five of 462 Q. variabilis trees, one of 371 Q. serrata trees and none of 3 Q. aliena trees. Wine-colored cossid larvae and/or their galleries were found on ca. 94% of sapexuding trees examined. All ten adults (two males and eight females) emerged from a part of the cossid larvae were oriental carpenter moths, Cossus jezoensis (Matsumura). The sap-exudation period was between mid-May and early November. Each of the larvae of C. jezoensis making their own galleries on the edge of bark-abraded parts (sap-exuding parts) was occasionally observed biting the surface of the bark-abraded part by changing the biting spot one after another (scraping behavior), pausing at the entrance of the gallery, fighting with the other inhabiting adjacent gallery, and walking on the stem surface. Furthermore, five larvae were observed attempting to prey on exuded sap-feeding insects. In another survey, the larvae were observed attempting to prey on exuded sap-feeding insects. One succeeded in preying on an ant, and another on a fly, in addition to preying on algophagid new mite species, Hericia sanukiensis inhabiting in exuded sap flows. Such predatory behaviors observed between June and November roughly coincided with the total period of sap-exudation. The scraping behavior and the exuded sap flowing from around the entrance of the larval galleries indicate that the long-term exudation of sap flow from deciduous Quercus trees is actively generated by the larvae of C. jezoensis to propagate the mites and to lure exuded sap-feeding insects.

AB  - Field incidence of yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) population by light trapping in relation to its neonatal forms in four consecutive years (2006-2009) has been carried out in the paddy field (var. Swarna mashuri, MTU 7029) at Raiganj, Uttar Dinajpur West Bengal. Peak formation was befitted with adult abundance resulting one major, two moderate and one minor peak in each year. Variation of the neonatal morphometric forms in relation to broods was also noted. The size of the moth was maximum in minor brood and minimum in major brood. In moderate broods, the size was however intermediate between the two broods.

TI  - Population monitoring of Pine Processionary Moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) by pheromone trapping at the southern limit of distribution of Pinus halepensis in Eastern Algeria
AB  - We monitored emergence dates of adults in order to assess local population density and to determine the life cycle of the Pine Processionary Moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Denis & Schif.). A series of 126 pheromone traps were placed randomly on trunks of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) located in the major forests of Batna City (North-eastern Algeria). We harvested daily contents of traps installed at an average height of 1.700.30 m, where a total of 19,339 males were captured from July 2008 to August 2008 with an average catch of 153.5179.4 per trap. Thus, pheromone traps provided an important tool to assess population density and rhythms of adult flight. In addition, different findings are discussed such as main factors influencing adult emergence. This study was based on the use of mating disruption by mass trapping to limit future outbreaks on the one hand, and to provide data on the exact dates of adult emergence to monitor future outbreaks and to use the appropriate control technique on the other hand. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that site variables that best explained the data were tree age and average stand height. CCA analysis indicated that altitude was not significant parameter. Factors leading to late adult emergence as well as PPM low densities in some forest stations are discussed.

TI  - The biology of Anacampsis populella (Clerck) (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae)
AB  - The paper deals with the occurrence, development and harmfulness of Anacampsis populella (Clerck) (Gelechiidae) on Populus tremula L. The pest was monitored on 5 to 15-year old trees of the species at Forest District Blovice nad Svitavou (near the city of Brno) in 2008 and 2009. Caterpillars made leaf rolls of a mean length of 37.3 mm and width 5.5 mm there. In 80% leaf rolls, one leaf was rolled up and in 20% two to five leaves. Towards the abaxial face of leaves, all leaves with caterpillars were rolled up but only part of peripheral leaves. Caterpillars occurred from 20 April to 25 June. They developed only through three instars and damaged leaves on an area of about 12.2 cm2. Grown up caterpillars pupated mostly in leaf-rolls. Pupae occurred from 10 May to 25 July and imagoes from 20 May to the beginning of August. Some 63 to 88% population of caterpillars and pupae were killed by natural enemies (particularly insect parasitoids, insect predators and birds). Eggs overwinter. The pest development is univoltine.

TI  - Dispersal estimates of codling moth fertilized females in a French farm based on kinship assessments
AB  - Until now, population dynamics of Lepidoptera pests were mainly inferred from the monitoring of adult males using pheromone traps. Here, we analysed the dynamics of dispersal of codling moth fertilized females, which is more closely connected with the agronomic attacks. The dispersal of the fertilized females was estimated using genetic inferences of full-sibs among their offspring. We collected 6824 larvae using geo-referenced band traps in nine orchards (differing in host-plants and insecticide practices) from an experimental farm (90 ha) for five generations (2003-2006). Heterogeneity in the densities of larvae was mainly explained by inter-generation (twice higher for the diapausing larvae generation) and inter-orchard (50 times higher in untreated apple orchards) differences. A sub-sample of 1064 individuals was genotyped with a set of 13 microsatellite loci for kinship inferences. Three hundred forty pairs of individuals were unambiguously determined as full-sibs. Ninety-six % of the full-sibs were collected within orchards, either on the same tree or on relatively distant trees. The remaining 4% pairs of full-sibs were collected at all the inter-orchard distances (80 to 700 m) including different host-plants. These results confirm the relatively sedentary behaviour of the codling moth females in spite of their ability to disperse over very long distances and to lay their eggs on different host-plants.

TI  - Monitoring for pyrethroid resistance in pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) field strains
AB  - Field experiments were conducted in two Governorates in Egypt (El-Behera and Alexandria) to study the situation of pyrethroid resistance in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera Gelechiidae), through two cotton seasons (2006 and 2007) using the attracticide resistance monitoring technique (ARMT) and the results were collected in both early and late season. The toxicity parameter (LC50) for the susceptible strain indicated that deltamethrin was the most toxic in the two durations (6 hr and 12 hr assessments) with LC50 of 0.8 and 0.19 ppm, respectively; followed by lambda-cyhalothrin (LC50 values=1.11 and 0.38 ppm, respectively) and then the least toxic was cypermethrin with LC50 values of 1.5 and 0.5 ppm, respectively. The resistance levels were varied between El-Behera population and Alexandria population and also varied between the two inspections (6 hr and 12 hr). On the other hand, the resistance values were differed from the early season assessment to the late season assessment and from the beginning of this investigation to the end. The starting resistance levels for El-Behera strain in the early 2006 cotton season at the 6 hr assessment were 79.8, 28.71 and 30.26 folds against cypermethrin, deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin; respectively, while these values reached 110.34, 40.5 and 41.26 folds, respectively by the late 2007 cotton season. Also this event was occurred in Alexandria strain. Regarding the calculated resistance values which derived from 12 hr assessment they showed different values than that of 6 hr assessment for both strains. For El-Behera strain these values became 36.92, 32.36 and 34.42 folds against cypermethrin, deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin; respectively; while the corresponding resistance values of Alexandria strain reached 87.22, 48.36 and 41.31 folds, respectively.

TI  - Remarkable records of Macrolepidoptera in Sweden 2009. / Intressanta fynd av storfjrilar (Macrolepidoptera) i Sverige 2009
AB  - This is the 37th consecutive annual report on interesting finds and provincial records of Macrolepidoptera in Sweden. The weather was varying with wet and cold periods but also periods of high pressures with warm spells and SE wind which created a fundament for immigration. Due to the weather and the two preceding years with long periods of unsuitable conditions many species occurred in low numbers, particularly the autumn species. Perhaps that is also the reason why only 24 new provincial records were made. Nevertheless three species were recorded for the first time in Sweden. They are Narraga fasciolaria, Archanara neurica and Agrotis puta, all expanding species. Among the more interesting finds of migrants were Rhodometra sacraria, Agrius convolvuli, Acherontia atropos, Macroglossum stellatarum, Eilema griseolum, Nycteola asiatica, Autographa mandarina, Cryphia algae, Hydraecia ultima, Peridroma saucia and Heliothis armigera. The status of Noctua interposita and Conisania luteago as migrants or resident species or perhaps both is uncertain. The moth Calyptra thalictri, firstly recorded last year, has shown to be resident and the species Antonechloris smaragdaria, Colobochyla salicalis and Eucarta virgo seems to be well established in Sweden. Eulithis pyropata was rediscovered (latest find 2005) on Gotland and is probably resident but in very low numbers. Lypusa maurella, earlier considered as a Psychid is now transferred to the Microlepidoptera, Gelechiodea. That means that the total numbers of Macrolepidoptera species is 1107. Of these, 1097 are found resident or temporary and 10 are considered as introduced species. The classification is according to Catalogus Lepidopterorum Sueciae (1994) with minor corrections following Karsholt & Razowski (1996).

TI  - Data on occurrence of economically significant moths for the locality elarevo (Vojvodina, Serbia). / Podaci o pojavi ekonomski znaajnih leptira za lokalitet elarevo (Vojvodina, Srbija)
AB  - Research of dynamics and number of moths was done by a light trap type RO Agrobeej in the period from 2008 to 2010 on the locality elarevo. Over 200 species were determined. Number and dynamics of the following species was presented Loxostege sticticalis, Ostrinia nubilalis, Autographa gamma, Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera exigua, Lacanobia oleracea, Mamestra brassicae, Agrotis ipsilon, A. exclamationis, A. segetum and Hyphantria cunea. For the presented species the following data were presented number of individual samples on the generation level, years and average annual number, time of beginning and end of the flight, time of the maximum flight occurrence or a period in which the largest number of moths was registered. All these parameters are basis for successful prognosis of occurrence of these moths on the locality elarevo by a light trap. In addition, average dynamics of flight of most numerous species was presented and the data were compared with the data for Novi Sad and Sombor.

TI  - Study of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armiqera Hbner (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) using Dyar's rule
AB  - Discrimination of different larval instars of insects is important in morphological, physiological and toxicological studies under laboratory conditions. The morphometric study of different parts of an insect's body is needed to obtain an index to distinguish different larval instars. In this study, Dyar's rule stating the ratio of size of each sclerotized body part in successive instars is in a constant range was studied on different larval instars of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The insects were reared at 262C, 605% RH and a photoperiod of 168 (LD) h. for 10 generations. One hundred larvae of each instar were randomly selected and width of head capsule in widest region, as well as length and width of stigmata located on prothorax and first and last abdominal segments were measured by calibrated micrometer. A frequency distribution plot showed that due to overlap in stigmata dimension, size of the stigmata was not a suitable index for distinguishing different larval instars in this insect. The widths of head capsule for 1st to 6th larval instars were 0.257-0.314, 0.4-0.485, 0.6-0.743, 0.96-1.2, 1.5-1.8 and 2.55-2.8 mm, respectively. Dyar's ratios for 1st to 6th larval instar intervals were obtained 1.52, 1.512, 1.631, 1.612 and 1.552, respectively. There was no overlap in the data range; therefore, head capsule width can be used with high confidence as an index to distinguish larval instars. Linear regression analysis revealed significant effect of larval instars on head capsule (R2=0.999). Despite strong relationship between dimension of stigmata and instar numbers, some strong overlapping in stigmata dimensions in subsequent instars decreased the usefulness of stigmata dimensions for instar discrimination. Overlapping particularly in the first abdominal stigmata was more than others.

TI  - Forecasting of Helicoverpa armigera populations and impact of climate change
AB  - Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) is a polyphagous insect pest and has been reported to feed on at least 181 plant species belonging to 45 botanical families in India. This insect pest has become of national importance because of huge losses caused to the high value crops such as cotton, soybean, tobacco, pulses, vegetables and cereals etc. Forecasting of the pest occurrence and peak activity periods is the prerequisite for an economically viable, environmentally sound and easily adaptable pest management programme. Adult population of H. armigera has been monitored successfully throughout India with the help of pheromone traps. By using the pheromone trap data, egg and larval count in the fields, damage caused to the crops and meteorological data, especially rainfall and temperature, region-specific prediction models have been developed and validated for Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Rainfall has been found to be important factor in forecasting H. armigera in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Temperature played the major role in the prediction model developed and validated for Uttar Pradesh. Whereas in Punjab, the peak population of H. armigera during March-April is dependent on temperature and humidity in February, while the high population during October depended on the rainfall during the rainy season.

TI  - Monitoring of four species of leaf rollers in orchards using pheromone traps. / Monitoring czterech gatunkw zwjkwek liciowych (tortricidae) w sadach z wykorzystaniem puapek feromonowych
AB  - In 2006-2009, the occurrence of leaf rollers was monitored in three different regions of Poland. The results of observations suggested diversified number of rollers in different regions and over different years. The highest number of recorded Archips rosanus rollers was in 2008, whereas Pandemis heparana roller peak occurred in 2007. Since 2007, in the region of Central Poland, the number of Adoxophyes orana and Spilonota ocellana roller systematically increased. A. orana roller occurred in high intensity throughout all the orchards in which conducted the research. Considerable differences were stated in dates of moths' flight initiation within individual orchards and vegetative seasons. The dynamics of moths' flight was also differentiated. Because of this there is a need of scheduling different treatment dates for each region and orchard.

TI  - Determination of major host plants and seasonal changes in infestation frequency of the sweetpotato vine borer, Omphisa anastomosalis (Lepidoptera Crambidae), on Kume Island, Okinawa
AB  - The host plants and seasonal occurrence of larvae and pupae of Omphisa anastomosalis were examined on Kume Island through the extensive collection of convolvulaceous host candidates from 2001 to 2010. The frequency of infestation was highest on Ipomoea indica (5.8 insects per 100 m of vine) followed by sweet potato (2.1 insects). Other Ipomoea spp. were infested rarely or not at all (&lt;0.6 insects). On I. indica, infestation frequency was negatively correlated with air temperature, with a large peak from January to February. The pupal ratio among the total population showed two clear peaks in June and October, and was zero or nearly zero in August and from December to April. These results suppose that at least two generations occur within a year, and may suggest a delay of larval development due to low temperatures in winter and the inhibition of pupation by high temperatures or other unknown factor(s) in summer. Further, the infestation frequency of I. indica decreased from April to July, while it increased or did not change in the sweetpotato field during this period.

TI  - Control of codling moth in Bulgaria with a combination of Isomate C plus dispensers and the baculovirus product Madex
AB  - In the years 2007-2009, trials on control of codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella (L.), were carried out in apple orchards of South-East Bulgaria, where the pressure of the pest was very high. Mating disruption with Isomate C plus dispensers was applied in combination with sprays of the virus product Madex. With a single installation of Isomate C plus dispensers per season+4 treatments of Madex at 100 ml per ha against the first and 6 treatments against the second generation, fruit damage at harvest and population density of codling moth were kept at a low level. At the same time fruit damage and population density of the pest, as estimated by the hibernating CM larvae population, was very high in the conventionally treated orchard serving as a reference. Using Isomate C plus dispensers and the baculovirus product Madex may be a promising alternative to traditional programmes trying to control high initial infestation of codling moth. For Bulgaria, the combined tested strategies of mating disruption and virus control are suggested for control of codling moth in the orchards with CM population density of more than 3 larvae per tree or more than 5% fruit damage in the previous year.

TI  - Preliminary study on butterflies of the Colfiorito plateaus Annifo plain and Colfiorito marsh (Lepidoptera)
AB  - The authors present the results of the first year of sampling that took place between April and September 2006 within the catchment basin of the Colfiorito plateaus in the eastern part of the Umbria region. The study area was located in two of seven plateaus of Colfiorito, known for their historical value and natural beauty the Annifo plain (cod. IT5210032) and the Colfiorito marsh (cod. IT5210034). A preliminary fauna list was compiled in which Euphydryas aurinia (Rottemburg, 1775) and Eriogaster catax (L., 1758) are of particular interest as they are included in the EC Habitats Directive 92/43 EEC. Subsequently, the lepidopteran community diversity was analysed using the following ecological indices Margalef's, Shannon-Wiener's, Simpson's and Species evenness. Diversity was calculated each month throughout the sampling period as well as for the vegetation that characterises the sampling stations.

TI  - Seasonal occurrence of shoot and fruit borer on okra in semi-arid region of Rajasthan
AB  - The incidence of shoot (Earias insulana) and fruit borer (E. vittella) on okra (cv. Parbhani Kranti) was studied in Jobner, Rajasthan, India, during the kharif of 2002 and 2003. Shoot borer infestation, which occurred from the first week of August until the harvesting of the crop, gradually increased from 1.0 and 0.66% during the initial stages to 23.0 and 25.0% on the third week of October in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Minimum temperature and relative humidity had a significant negative correlation with shoot borer infestation. Fruit borer infestation commenced on the first week of September in 2002 and 2003. The level of infestation gradually increased as the crop matured, reaching a peak of 31.6% in terms of number and 29.7 on a weight basis in 2002 (34.0 and 31.0%, respectively, in 2003). The maximum and minimum temperatures were negatively correlated with fruit borer infestation.

AB  - The moth Archanara neurica (Hb.), Noctuidae, was discovered in the South Bohemian erni wetland (Czech Republic) during several recent years (1999-2008) after 28 years (1981-2008) of long-term light trap monitoring. This is the first record of A. neurica in Bohemia. In the Czech Republic this species was known from Moravia only and recorded from most Central European countries recently. The recent expansion of the geographic range of A. neurica and several other moths feeding in larval stage on the reed Phragmites australis seems to be associated with the invasive strategy of this food plant in Central Europe.

TI  - Phenological variability and insecticide susceptibility of the summer fruit tortrix moth (Adoxophyes orana) in the Valais. / Variabilit phnologique et sensibilit aux insecticides de capua (Adoxophyes orana) en Valais
AB  - The summer fruit tortrix moth (Adoxophyes orana) is an important pest insect in orchards. In 2004, the first cases of insecticide resistance were observed in the canton Vaud and recently fruit growers of the Valais indicated a reduction in insecticides' effectiveness. In 2008, a survey conducted in the Valais showed that the amount of apples and pears damaged by A. orana was generally low. However, moth's abundance is heterogeneous and larval development is poorly synchronised between orchards. Thus, a large variability between A. orana's flight periods was observed among sites. Besides, moths flew for a third time in September. The assessment of an indoxacarb application in a commercial orchard indicated that the insecticide was still efficient. This observation was confirmed by the analysis of different active ingredients in the laboratory. Larvae of A. orana originating from a single orchard in the Valais were exposed to five different insecticides by the dipping of leaves. At the 99% lethal dosage, indoxacarb, methoxyfenozide and tebufenozide killed all exposed larvae. However, the tested strain was slightly resistant against chlorpyrifos-methyl and fenoxycarb. Overall, we strongly recommend the careful monitoring of A. orana's population dynamic within orchards and a regular alternation between the different chemical, biotechnological and biological classes of active ingredients applied.

TI  - Seasonal flight of leopard moth borer Zeuzera pyrina (Lepidoptera Cossidae) in Bulgaria
AB  - Seasonal monitoring of the flight of the leopard moth borer, Zeuzera pyrina L. was conducted by pheromone traps in the experimental apple orchards of the Fruit Growing Institute and of the Agricultural University in Plovdiv (Central South Bulgaria) in the years 2002-2006. Two types of pheromone traps were used Pherocon traps (Trc, USA) with sticky changeable bottom and Mastrap (Isagro, Italy) dry funnel traps. The dispensers were products of Isagro, Italy. The traps were installed every year at the end of May and removed at the end of September. As a whole the flight of the leopard moth begins in the middle of June although in some years the first catches were recorded in the first decade of June. The mass flight was recorded mainly in July in all years of the study. The last catches were recorded at the end of August - beginning of September. The pheromone dispensers for Zeuzera pyrina L. have shown a good selectivity. No other species were caught in the traps. However, the catches were relatively low, considering that the population level of the pest, as estimated by injuries, was found to be quite high. No significant differences between the catches in sticky and dry traps was found in the orchards of the Fruit Growing Institute for all years of the investigations, but the catches on the dry traps were significantly higher than the catches on sticky traps in one of the orchards of the Agricultural University in both 2005 and 2006. The trend of seasonal flight in all orchards, estimated by the same kind of traps, sticky or dry, was very similar every year. The results of this investigation, which was carried out in Bulgaria for the first time, will be used for facilitating the usage of pheromone traps for this pest for the purposes of prognosis.

TI  - Geographic distribution and seasonal catches of three Adoxophyes species in Korea
AB  - Adoxophyes spp. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) are economically important pests of fruit trees in Asia and Europe. The geographical distribution of three Adoxophyes species, A. orana, A. honmai and A. paraorana, in Korea was surveyed using species-specific sex pheromone traps for males in 2006 and 2007. The distribution of A. orana was restricted in the midwestern area, while A. honmai was found mainly in the southern area. In contrast to these two species, A. paraorana was widely distributed. Moreover, A. paraorana coexisted with A. orana in the midwestern area, and with A. honmai in the southern area. The seasonal fluctuation of male catches was monitored with pheromone traps in 2008. In the central regions, males of A. orana and A. paraorana were captured from May to September, with peak numbers in late May, middle July, and late August. A. honmai males were trapped from late April to late September, with peak catches in middle May, late June, early August, and early September in Naju.

TI  - Repeated independent evolution of obligate pollination mutualism in the Phyllantheae-Epicephala association
AB  - The well-known fig-fig wasp and yucca-yucca moth mutualisms are classic examples of obligate mutualisms that have been shaped by millions of years of coevolution. Pollination systems involving obligate seed parasites are only expected to evolve under rare circumstances where their positive effects are not swamped by abundant co-pollinators and heavy costs resulting from seed destruction. Here, we show that, in Phyllantheae, specialization to pollination by Epicephala moths evolved at least five times, involving more than 500 Phyllantheae species in this obligate association. Active pollination behaviour evolved once in Epicephala, 10-20 Myr after the initial divergence of their host plants. The pollinating Epicephala moths thus radiated on an already-diverged host lineage and successively colonized new Phyllantheae hosts, thereby giving rise to repeated independent evolution of the specialized pollination system in Phyllantheae. The present evolutionary success of this association rests entirely upon active pollination by Epicephala, making this a distinct example of an evolutionary key innovation. Overall, our findings provide a clear empirical demonstration of how a combination of evolutionary innovation and partner shifts facilitates the spread of mutualism in a coevolving species interaction.

TI  - Cotton production in the presence of Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) in central Greece
AB  - The aim of the present research was to study fluctuations of populations of P. gossypiella in various areas in the Prefecture of Larissa. Data were analyzed to found the relation between population density of the insect and cotton production and additionally, to explore year and local (area) conditions as factors affecting damage levels. Correlations on data between years (across all communities) revealed that, when cotton production was high then the number of adult male insects of P. gossypiella captured in pheromone traps was also high (r=+0.93). Our data indicate that, when the environmental conditions of specific years favored cotton production, then the population of P. gossypiella was high due to the availability of food (more flowers and bolls), in a kind of synchronization. In parallel, the presence of increased numbers of useful insects that predate cotton enemies may result in lower damages on cotton production. In years 2002 and 2003, the presence of the insect may contribute in lower cotton production in the areas where population of adult males trapped was high. The mean cotton production was generally low in the areas where population of P. gossypiella was high. In this case, although statistically not significant, the tension was negative (r=-0.37). Local conditions within each area have been proved important and these results were completely different compared to data concerning years. The specific conditions within each area determine the balance between the insect population and level of damage on cotton production. There were areas where the insect showed increased populations resulting in low cotton production. These areas may need special treatment with insecticides or other techniques in order to decrease insect populations.

TI  - Caterpillars of Lepidoptera in crowns of mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.) in the Ore Mountains
AB  - Mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.) is an important substitute tree species in stands in the Ore Mountains loaded with air-pollution. Among 84 caterpillar species (Lepidoptera) obtained by the method of shaking off from mountain ash crowns in 2008, the highest abundance was found in the species Campaea margaritata (L.), Venusia cambrica Curtis, Opisthograptis luteolata (L.) and Hedya nubiferana (Haw.). The species diversity increased with altitude without showing preferences for individual species. In the early spring aspect (31 species), there were most abundant Hedya nubiferana, H. pruniana (Hbn.) and Trachycera advenella (Zincken); in the spring aspect (57 species) Agriopis aurantiaria (Hbn.) and Alsophila aescularia (Den. et Schiff.); in the summer aspect (55 species) V. cambrica; in the late summer aspect (23 species) O. luteolata and C. margaritata; in the autumnal aspect (11 species) C. margaritata. Damage to the mountain ash berries ranged from 21.3 to 94.1%, and it was caused by Argyresthia conjugella (Zell.). Moths of the species hatched in the gradation years at the of effective temperatures about 900C.

TI  - Seasonal fluctuations in populations of Lepidopteran species as influenced by conventional control in tobacco stores
AB  - Ephestia elutella (Hbner) and Plodia interpunctella (Hbner) are very important stored product pests. E. elutella cause widespread infestations by attacking stored tobacco and P. interpunctella is common pest in stored products. This study was carried out to determine the distribution and seasonal fluctuations in populations of these two moth species in tobacco warehouses in the Osmangazi and Mudanya districts of Bursa province, northwestern Turkey. Pherocon II traps baited with IMM+4 (pheromone of P. interpunctella) pheromone lures were used for monitoring fluctuations in adult populations. The first adults of E. elutella were observed in April-May; adult P. interpunctella first appeared in early June. E. elutella was most abundant of the two species. There were 2-3 population peaks of E. elutella in Osmangazi and 3-4 in Mudanya. P. interpunctella was also present but captures were lower than those of E. elutella. At Mudanya, P. interpunctella adults showed three population peaks in 2001 and two in 2002. There was a correlation between trap location and the number of moths captured in Mudanya tobacco store. Consequently, more P. interpunctella were captured in traps near openings to the outside than in the other traps.

TI  - Occurrence of Grapholita dimorpha Komai (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), a new insect pest in apple orchards of Korea
AB  - Monitoring was conducted to investigate the occurrence of Grapholita dimorpha Komai in Korean apple orchards using sex pheromone traps. G. dimorpa showed four peaks per year early May, from late June to early July, from late July to mid August, and from late August to September. After adult emergence of the over-wintered G. dimorpha, G. dimorpha catches was decreased significantly and increased again after July. In G. molesta traps, G. molesta and G. dimorpha were trapped by 98.8 and 1.2%, respectively. Conversely in G. dimorpha traps, G. dimorpha and G. molesta were trapped by 99.7 and 0.3%, respectively. The 30.6% of the moths from the damaged apple fruits were G. dimorpha. This is the first report on G. dimorpha in apple orchards in Korea.

TI  - Crop losses due to two sugarcane stem borers in Runion and South Africa
AB  - The impact on sugarcane yield of two key stem borer species, Chilo sacchariphagus and Eldana saccharina, were investigated over a period of 10 years in Runion Island and South Africa. Replicated and randomised field plot trials were conducted. Treatments consisted of pest exclusion using concentrated and repeated chemical applications, of natural infestations, and of artificial inoculations to enhance these infestations. The relationship between borer injury (measured as percent bored internodes) and the corresponding stalk length and diameter, biomass, fibre and sugar content were determined. Borer injury impaired the growth and reduced quality of sugarcane stalks. C. sacchariphagus decreased stalk biomass to a greater extent than sucrose content. E. saccharina injury reduced sucrose content and increased fibre level, and affected to a lesser extent stalk biomass. Since E. saccharina typically attacks sugarcane early during the main period of biomass accumulation and C. sacchariphagus attacks later during the maturation phase, the timing of borer infestations might explain these results. Numerous components of stalk quality were negatively correlated to injury from both species. Chilo sacchariphagus impacted mostly sugarcane biomass while E. saccharina decreased sucrose content. Crop loss models, as well as the formulation of any IPM recommendation, would need to be specific to the borer species.

TI  - Occurrence and host plants of Grapholita dimorpha (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in central areas of Iwate Prefecture
AB  - The occurrence of Grapholita dimorpha around apple orchards in the central areas of Iwate prefecture, Japan, was investigated in cooperation with forecasting activities by apple farmers. G. dimorpha was found to be common in these areas, since adult males were caught at 21 of 23 sites by sex pheromone traps during the 2008 season. The total number and seasonal trend of captured individuals varied across years and survey points, although 3 prevalent periods were recognized at several points where more than 100 individuals were caught in one season. In the apple orchards without chemical spray, fruit damage by G. dimorpha was observed only in September and October. The early generation of G. dimorpha were detected mainly on Japanese plum or European plum. Damage on apple in autumn was ascribed to changes in the host preference of late generations of G. dimorpha.

TI  - Field monitoring of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), by pheromone traps in Bulgaria and Romania
AB  - Seasonal monitoring of the flight of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (CM), was conducted by pheromone traps in the experimental apple orchards in Plovdiv (Central South Bulgaria) and in Bistrita (North Romania) in the years 2004-2006. The Pherocon traps of Trc, USA, with sticky changeable bottom, were used in Bulgaria. The dispensers were also products of Trc. In Romania pheromone traps and baits Atra-Pom, produced by the Institute of Chemistry "Raluca Ripan" in Cluj-Napoca, were employed. The earliest catches of CM in Bulgaria were recorded in the third decade of April in all years of the study. In Romania it occurred in the third decade of April in the years 2004 and 2005, but in the second decade of May in 2006. The mass flight of CM in Bulgaria was recorded in the years 2004 and 2005 in the first decade of May and continued through the second decade of June, whereas in 2006 it was in the second decade of May and in the third decade of June. In Romania the mass flight was recorded in the second decade of May and in the second decade of June in the years 2004 and 2005, whereas in 2006 it was noted at the beginning of June and in the third decade of June. In both countries the codling moth develops two generations per year. However, in Romania the first generation is more harmful than the second one, whereas in Bulgaria the second generation is more important. This is apparently related to different thermal conditions, due to location at different latitudes. The results obtained may be helpful for improvement of prognosing appearance of the pest and its control.

TI  - Monitoring and predicting populations of the tropical grass webworm (Herpetogramma licarsisalis) a pest of kikuyu pasture in Northland
AB  - A monitoring programme for the tropical grass webworm (TGW) (Herpetogramma licarsisalis) has been operating in the Far North since 1999, when high densities of the larva resulted in severe defoliation of large areas of kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) pasture. Flight patterns of adult TGW were monitored using pheromone traps; larval populations were sampled using quadrat sampling of pasture. Rainfall and temperature measurements were recorded throughout summer and late autumn in each of the years sampled. The data collected have enabled an early warning system to operate which advises farmers of the risk of a tropical grass webworm outbreak. Warnings of potential outbreaks are distributed via local media and the Northland Regional Council website. When larvae numbers in pasture are greater than 50/m2, and warm, moist conditions prevail, farmers can consider appropriate management decisions to secure feed for stock.

TI  - The eastern pine processionary in forests of the "Kurshskaya Kosa" National Park
AB  - Results are presented from many years of study of the biology and economic importance of the eastern pine processionary (Thaumetopoea pinivora), a little-known forest pest. The study was carried out in the "Kurshskaya Kosa" National Park in Kaliningrad Province, Russia, where the moth is a permanent resident of the margins and clearings of plantations of Scots pine [Pinus sylvestris], mountain pine [P. mugo] and Crimean pine [P. nigra subsp. pallasiana] growing on coastal sand dunes. The moth has 2 phenological generations developing over a 2-year period, with both eggs and pupae overwintering. Females produce an average of 170 eggs per year (range 126-202). Pest numbers tend to be stable and high, with slight fluctuations from year to year. Defoliation of pine trees by larvae is around 5-15%, with no serious consequences for tree survival. The main problem with the pest is the serious allergic response some visitors to the recreational areas of the park exhibit from contact with the caterpillars' toxic hairs.

TI  - Life table parameters of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lep. Noctuidae) on different soybean cultivars
AB  - Influence of 13 soybean cultivars (356, M4, M7, M9, Clark, Sahar, JK, BP, Williams, L17, Zane, Gorgan3 and DPX) on the life table parameters of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) was studied at 251C, relative humidity of 655% and a photoperiod of 168 (LD) h. The survival rate (lx) of individuals developed to adults from the initial cohort on the mentioned cultivars was estimated 0.87, 0.83, 0.96, 0.96, 0.77, 0.72, 0.81, 0.72, 0.85, 0.74, 0.85, 0.88 and 0.72, respectively. The longest and shortest life expectancy (ex) of the pest was 44.22 and 35.98 days on Gorgan3 and BP, respectively at the beginning of life. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) on different cultivars ranged from 0.1324 to 0.1848 (day-1), which was lowest on 356 and highest on M9. The highest net reproductive rate (R0) was on MV (354.92 female/female/generation) and the lowest value of this parameter was on 356 (89.35). The values of finite rate of increase (), mean generation time (T) and doubling time (DT) on different soybean cultivars were as follows 1.14 to 1.20 female offspring per female per day for , 28.85 to 36.61 days for T and 3.75 to 5.23 days for DT. Because of the higher coefficient of determination (R2) value in Gompertz model, data from different cultivars had a better fit to this model compared with Weibull model. The results indicated that 356, L17, Gorgan3, BP and Sahar cultivars were less suitable host plants, suggesting that they are more resistant to H. armigera than the other cultivars.

TI  - Pheromone trap catches of bean webworm Pleuroptya ruralis (Lepidoptera Crambidae) in soybean fields and colonies of Boehmeria silvestri
AB  - Field studies were conducted in Japan to establish the forecasting used pheromone trap and analyse the ecology of Pleuroptyra ruralis. Pheromone trap catches of P. ruralis in the soyabean fields and the colonies of Boehmeria silvestrii were compared to the beating method (counting the number of adults by beating on food plant leaves). In the soyabean fields, the peak incidence of overwintering generation adults occurred clearer than beating method. In one soyabean field, the pheromone trap catches and the number of beatings showed similar trends, but it was different in another field. The first generation, adult catches that emerged in soyabean during mid-August to mid-September was very few compared to the beating method. This result suggested that the copulation activity of males were low. The pheromone trap catches in the colonies of B. silvestrii occurred in mid-July and during mid-September to late October.

TI  - Field trial and agronomic performance of antibiotics in naturally-colored cotton against key leaf damaging pests
AB  - Laboratory tests were conducted to acquire the antibiotic effect of white and naturally-colored cotton varieties/lines, AP2, PM1 and PM4 compared to the control, SR60, using fresh leaves fed to the 3rd instar Helicoverpa armigera larvae. There were no significant differences found in the developmental times and weights of the bollworm larvae and pupae fed on the leaves of the different cotton varieties/lines except for the percentage of adult abnormalities in PM1and PM4. The leaf damage by the leafhoppers was undertaken in a greenhouse using adult and nymph leafhoppers released in a screen cage containing one month-old cotton plants of each variety/line grown in pots. After 14 days, the results revealed that AP2 had the lowest score for hopperburn rating (3.5). Cotton variety trials in sprayed and unsprayed plots were conducted during 2006 and 2007 at two locations, the Field Crop Research Center at Nakhon Ratchasima and a farmer's field at Thongpapoom, Kanchanaburi. The mean annual number of key pests and the annual yield of each variety/line at each location were compared and the average agronomic performance of each variety/line was HVI analyzed. At Nakhon Ratchasima, leafhoppers were more abundant than aphids and whiteflies in both 2006 and 2007. There was a significant difference in the mean leafhopper numbers for AP2 and PM4 between both plots during the two years, while for PM1 there was a significant difference in 2007 only. Seed weights of SR60 and PM1 differed between the sprayed and unsprayed plots in 2006. At Tongpapoom, Kanchanaburi, both SR60 and PM4 in 2006, and PM4 again in 2007 had significantly different amounts of leafhopper between the sprayed and unsprayed plots. The yield of SR60 in the sprayed plot significantly differed from the unsprayed plots in 2006. Agronomic performance of each cotton fiber found only micronaire range in PM1 from Thongpapoom and the fiber lengths of SR60, AP2 and PM1 grown at Nakhon Ratchasima to be designated as premium. At Tongpapoom, the AP2 fiber length fell in the base range. The percent lint of AP2 was the highest at Nakhon Ratchasima, while PM4 had the lowest value for this parameter at both locations.

TI  - Seasonal biology and management of the maple shoot borer, Proteoteras aesculana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), in production nurseries
AB  - BACKGROUND Proteoteras aesculana (Riley), a caterpillar that causes tip dieback and kills the central leader of maples, is an important nursery pest. The authors sought to develop a pheromone lure, use it to clarify the pest's seasonal biology, determine when and where infestations originate and extend the management window. RESULTS Gas chromatography, electroantennographic detection and trapping showed that (Z)-dodec-8-en-1-ol (Z8-12OH) is the major sex pheromone component. Flight began in March, peaking in early spring. Larvae developed during April and May, giving rise to moths active in late May and June. No additional larvae were found in maples following that flight. Sporadic moth captures occurred into November, suggesting that adults overwinter. Three parasitoid species, all new host records, were documented. A different tortricid, Episimus tyrius Heinrich, caused leaf-tying damage in late summer. Maples shipped from Oregon were free of shoot borers, refuting speculation that larvae overwinter in buds. One bifenthrin spray applied from just before bud break at onset of moth flight to just after peak flight when shoots had two pairs of leaves reduced infestation by 96-100%. CONCLUSION Maples are infested soon after planting in Kentucky nurseries via eggs laid in early spring. The temporal window for preventive control is broader than previously thought.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermller) male population in a central Italy agro-ecosystem
AB  - The spatial analysis of the pheromone trap catches of European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermller) males was undertaken in Abruzzo, region situated in central Italy, during years 2005 and 2006. In the study area, vineyards are the most spread cultivation, surrounded by hedgerows, small woodlots and alternated with cereal and olive groves. The main purpose of the study was to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of pest, inside and outside vineyards and to evaluate the effect of the landscape elements on pest distribution. The activity of L. botrana adult males was monitored weekly using 40 sticky traps, baited with 1 mg of pheromone (E,Z)-7,9-dodecadienyl acetate. Geostatistical methods were used to characterize the spatial distribution of European grapevine moth. For the annual sum of catches and single flights, models fit from variogram analyses were used to interpolate insect catches by means of the kriging algorithm and contour maps were obtained. Our results showed that the presence of L. botrana was not limited to vineyards, particularly at the beginning of the season, when most of the males were cached inside olive groves. The adult distribution in the experimental area changed during the season contour maps showed that hot spots of the I flight were positioned inside olive groves, during the II and the III flight they concentrated in vineyards. L. botrana males were observed also in uncultivated fields, but never as hot spot. Large proportion of European grapevine moth adults is in zones usually uncovered by pest management programs. In the area under study, the olive plant must be seen as the main reservoir of adult population outside vineyards. In many parts of central and southern Italy, vineyards and olive groves are two of the most spread cultivations and are frequently neighbouring. In these areas, L. botrana can disperse in the landscape and adults move between contiguous crops. In such a context, during monitoring and control operations, it is highly recommended to consider the whole landscape, with particular attention to olive crops.

TI  - Monitoring mill moth (Ephestia kehniella Zell.) by pheromone traps in Belarus
AB  - The prevalence, biology and phenology of the Mediterranean flour moth or mill moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller in flour mills and bakeries of Belarus were given. The dynamics of development in the closed heated rooms and influence of ecological factors on these changes are described, the use of pheromone traps for monitoring mill moths were given. Results of the researches for 2004-2006 on efficiency of the new synthesized samples of working substances for catching the pest under production conditions at different densities of insect populations were discussed. The most effective concentrations that allow carrying out monitoring and identifying mill moth occurrence, dependence between catching in the pheromone traps and their density on volume unit of a room is revealed. The catching of mill moths using synthetic sex pheromones, kayromones and new attractants in milling rooms, unpacked storage of flour storage rooms and bakeries is given. The results will allow to establish beforehand density of the Lepidoptera populations for the further drawing up of their activity forecast, damage and the application of various protection methods according to the pest number. The successful use of pheromones for mass trapping in grain processing enterprises of Belarus was demonstrated.

TI  - Performances of an expanding insect under elevated CO2 and snow cover in the Alps
AB  - Variations of phenology and distribution have been recently highlighted in numerous insect species and attributed to climate change, particularly the increase of temperature and atmospheric CO2. Both have been shown to have direct and indirect effects on insect species of various ecosystems, though the responses are often species-specific. The pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae) is an important pest of conifers in the Mediterranean region, and has been recently shown to expand its altitudinal range in the Alps, including the mountain pine Pinus mugo as a novel host. We had the opportunity to transplant colonies of the pine processionary moth to a high elevation site well outside of the current range of the insect (Stillberg, Davos, Switzerland, 2180 m), where trees of the mountain pine have been grown for five years under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations (ca. 570 ppm). The aim of the study was to evaluate the response of first instar larvae to extreme conditions of temperature and to an altered performance induced by the change of host metabolism under elevated CO2. Larval mortality and relative growth rate did not differ between host trees grown in ambient or elevated CO2. As extended snow cover may be an important mortality factor of larval colonies on the dwarf trees of mountain pine, we tested the survival of colonies transplanted at two extreme sites of Eastern Alps. The snow cover extended over more than one month proved to be an important mortality factor of larval colonies on mountain pine. We concluded that the first instar larvae of the pine processionary moth are not concerned by unusually low temperature and CO2 increase whereas they can be later strongly affected by snow accumulation. The decrease of snow cover observed in the last decades, however, may reduce such a risk.

TI  - Tracking pyrethroid resistance in the polyphagous bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera Noctuidae), in the shifting landscape of a cotton-growing area
AB  - In cotton-growing areas of Central Africa, timing of host crops and pest management practices in annual rainfed cropping systems result in a shifting mosaic of habitats that influence the dynamics and resistance of Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) populations on spatial scales, both within and across seasons. From 2002 to 2006, regional and local resistance was monitored among cotton fields and among the major host plants of the bollworm. From 2002, pyrethroid resistance increased within and across cotton-growing seasons to reach a worrying situation at the end of the 2005 growing season. Cotton crops played a fundamental role in the increase in seasonal resistance, even if the intensive use of insecticides on local tomato crops strongly concentrated resistance alleles in residual populations throughout the off-season. Due to the relative stability of resistance in H. armigera populations despite a long off-season, we believe that after the dispersal of the moths southwards at the end of the growing season, reverse migration mainly accounts for the reconstitution of populations at the onset of the following growing season. In addition, local resistance monitoring in 2005 and 2006 showed that it was possible to control the increase in resistance by temporarily stopping the use of pyrethroids during the period of peak infestation of cotton by H. armigera. On the other hand, the similar resistance frequency of populations sampled from sprayed and unsprayed synchronous hosts confirmed the absence of reproductive isolation between adults. As a result, diversity in cropping systems should be encouraged by planting alternative host plants to provide a mosaic of habitats, which in return would provide insecticide-free refuges. The implications for insecticide resistance management in annual cropping systems are discussed.

TI  - A brief history of commercial crops planted in the Tawau residency and throughout Sabah
AB  - The present agricultural scene in Sabah is dominated by oil palm but this has not always been the case. In the early days, the cultivation of coconuts, sago and pepper for domestic purposes was widespread among the Kadazans and sago was grown commercially on a large scale in the Padas Klias Peninsular during the 1880s. The British North Borneo Company (BNBC) was formed in 1880 and an experimental garden established in 1898 at Silam. Although closed down 2 years later, this was enoufh for a whole range of crops to have been planted including oil palm, rubber, cocoa, sugarcane, jute, coffee, soyabean, pineapple, kapok and mulberries for silk production. Of all the crops planted, only rubber, manila hemp, cocoa and oil palm were to obtain commercial significance. An attempt in the mid-1880s to plant sugar by the Chinese Sabah Land Farming Company on a 16 000 acreconcession failed, because of a drastic fall in the price of sugar before the project even started. This motivated the company's directors to seek permission from the BNBC to plant tobacco near the Suanlamba River, south of Sandakan in 1883. The results were an astounding success as the first dry tobacco samples sent to London in February 1884 were declared to be among the best available and in 1885 and 1886 the small crop sold in Amsterdam realized higher prices than the finest Deli leaf from Sumatra. The outcome was an immediate rush to buy up land in Sabah for tobacco planting and the tobacco boom had begun. Nevertheless, things went along well enough until in 1891 when the US government closed its doors to foreign imports of tobacco to protect their own plantation industry in the southern states. However, production still continued and tobacco remained Sabah's primary export crop until 1914 and in 1913 accounted for two-fifths of the total value of the territory's exports. The last producer of high quality cigar wrapper leaf finally closed down in 1962. By 1917, a total of 13 933 acres were under rubber and 2444 long tonnes of rubber were exported. The area under rubber in 1928 was 96 037 acres and 6698 long tonnes of rubber worth about &lt;pounds&gt;580 000 were exported way above timber at &lt;pounds&gt;247 000, tobacco at &lt;pounds&gt;116 000 and copra at &lt;pounds&gt;60 500 exported in the same year. The current annual exports of rubber from Sabah amount to approximately 40 000 tonnes and with high prices realized that the crop is a very profitable one. Manila hemp was planted from the late-1920s onwards on the rich volcanic soils. Replacement with cocoa and oil palm started from 1962 onwards as the hemp price remained low for several years and the market gradually lost to synthetic fibres. In 1961, a total of 3927 long tonnes were produced from approximately 3000 acres. Cocoa also played an important part and the first commercial planting took place in 1956. The coca yield and crop quality in Sabah was world class and cocoa planting boomed in the 1970s and early 1980s. That is until the arrival of a new pest in 1981 in the form of a cocoa pod borer called Acrocercops cramerella [Conopomorpha cramerella]. The moth spread quickly throughout the state and seriously increased production cost which, together with several years of low price and higher labour requirements, prompted planters to switch to oil palm and acreage declined rapidly. The planted cocoa area decreased from 175 000 hectares in 1993 to 94 000 hectares in 1997 and has further reduced to 20 800 hectares. Today only 7200 hectares remain planted on estates and another 13 600 are cultivated by smallholders.

TI  - Studies on the relationship between occurrence degree of cotton bollworm and rainfall
AB  - Objective The aim of the study is to investigate the factors causing the outbreak of cotton bollworm and to provide effective measures for controlling cotton bollworm. Method Based on the analysis of the data about insect and weather situation in Luyi County in 32 years, the meteorological prediction model was established for monitoring the quarterly or monthly occurrence trend of cotton bollworm. Result The cotton bollworm occurred slightly in the years with rainfalls of 3 months over 500 nm and severely in the years with rainfalls of 3 months less than 400 nm. The results of correlation analysis show that annual occurrence degrees of cotton bollworm and occurrence degrees of 4th generation of cotton bollworm are extremely negatively correlated with rainfall during June-August; the occurrence degrees of 3rd and 4th generations of cotton bollworm are also extremely negatively correlated with rainfall in July. Conclusion The occurrence of cotton bollworm in field is heavily influenced by rainfall in at its occurrence stage, moreover, the rainfall during June-August is the decisive factors influencing the occurrence of cotton bollworm.

TI  - Genetic differentiation of overwintering populations of oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta, and their movement
AB  - Spring phonology of the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta, was monitored using sex pheromone traps in apple cultivating areas. Their occurrence was earlier in southern areas and their population sizes were significantly different among orchards even in a local cultivating zone. The overwintering populations appeared to move between local orchards, based on the fact that monitoring data obtained at the sites between orchards were similar to those of nearby orchards. However, within orchards, these adult movements appeared to decrease and showed skewed occurrences at the side of upwind direction or close to neighboring orchards. At initial occurrence peak (April 20-25), the overwintering populations of the different localities were collected and analyzed in their genetic distances. PCR-RAPD analysis indicated that there were significant genetic differences among the overwintering populations of G. molesta. This genetic differentiation of overwintering populations may be due to genetic bottleneck following differential selection pressures against the subpopulations of G. molesta during winter on the basis of the RAPD analysis that each early spring population was significantly different to its previous fall population in the same locality.

TI  - Life table of Pseudodirphia pallida (Lepidoptera Saturniidae) in laboratory conditions. / Tabla de vida de Pseudodirphia pallida (Lepidoptera Saturniidae) en condiciones de laboratorio
AB  - Saturniidae and particularly Dirphia sensu lato include many economically important moth species that have generated considerable attention during the last years in relation to damage caused to eucalyptus, sugar cane and oil palm plants. However, the knowledge of basic aspects of the group is incomplete and the taxonomy is difficult. Many species have not been described and there are few detailed studies on biology and population dynamics. In the present study a morphological description is made of the immature stages of Pseudodirphia pallida. The species was reared under laboratory conditions and general aspects of life table are registered. Photographic aspects of the different immature stages are also presented and an expanded species description is provided based on both immature and adult characteristics. The specimens were reared in the insectary of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia at Medellin at a mean temperature of 24C and relative humidity 71%. The larvae were fed with Bcaro (Erythrina fusca) leaves. A bivoltine life cycle was observed with a duration between 136 and 171 days and a total of five larval instars. The immature stages of shortest duration were L2 and L3 and the longest L4. The highest mortality rates were found in L1 and the prepupal stage. Larvae exhibited a gregarious behavior until L3.

TI  - Toxicological effects of some insecticides against Welsh onion beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua)
AB  - The Welsh onion beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hbner), has attacked Welsh onion and is now the most important pest of Welsh onion in southwestern Korea. The beet armyworm has a wide host range, occurring as a serious pest of vegetable and fields. The relatively high abundance of beet armyworm has stimulated frequent application of insecticides to foliage. Insecticide resistance is a major problem in management of this insect. Accordingly, pesticide application for the control of beet armyworm was tried in both the open field and in laboratory, using 4 synthetic compounds such as metaflumizone and chlorfenapyr, indoxacarb, flufenoxuron, emamectin benzoate. In the laboratory, each developmental stages from eggs, larva to pupa was tested against 4 insecticides. Against the eggs of welsh onion beet armyworm, there was no significantly different with each other. These tested chemicals no killing effect to eggs. However, the population of 1st larva hatched from eggs were reduced because they eaten the egg shell with residual insecticides. The tested insecticides were taken very high mortalities to 1st to 3rd larva of Welsh onion beet armyworm. Otherwise, there were decreased the death rate from 4th to 6th larva. On the other hand, their value of control effects were relatively good against Welsh onion beet armyworms in the field between 87.2 and 90.5% on 10 days after insecticide application.

TI  - Seasonal population variations of the bark eating caterpillar (Indarbela quadrinotata) in Casuarina plantations of Tamil Nadu
AB  - The study was carried out in an 8-year-old Casuarina plantation at Pudupattinam area of Nagapattinam district, coming under the Cauvery delta zone of Tamil Nadu, India during December 2000 to September 2002. The population variation of I. quadrinotata in the fixed and variable tree plots are illustrated. There were 3 peaks in larval population in February, August and November in the fixed tree plot. Almost a similar trend was noticed in the variable tree plot also. The moth emergence was observed during May-July, which coincided with the pre-monsoon showers from the south-west monsoon. The larval establishment was seen in the month of August and the first peak of infestation was also observed during this month. Another peak in larval population occurred during November, which emerged from the eggs laid by the moths late in the month of July. A third peak in larval population was noticed during January/February, which coincided with the rainfall during these months. However, an increase in larval population in January/February cannot be attributed to the moths emerged during May-July.

TI  - Approach to outbreak mechanism of Dendrolimus punctatus (Lepidoptera Lasiocampidae)
AB  - The outbreak pattern of Masson pine caterpillar (MPC, Demdraolimus punctatus) have both periodic and stochastic characteristics. In different environment conditions the outbreak pattern are different. In frequently outbreak area, the pattern is usually eruptive, while in occasionally outbreak and non-outbreak area the pattern are gradient, emigration, or stable at low population density. The outbreak causes in one hand is high fecundity of MPC and more importantly the existence of large-scale pure pine forests. Outbreaks usually initiate by high temperature and drought or chaotic dynamics under the influence of environmental noise. During the increase phase the dynamics are droved by positive density dependent factors while in decline and endemic phase the negative density dependent factors such as induced host resistance and natural enemies play an important role. Vegetation and invertebrate diversity take a main role in the suppression of MPC outbreaks.

TI  - Temporal occurrence of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in Cameron Highlands, Pahang
AB  - Adult of Spodoptera exigua populations were monitored in Cameron Highlands using pheromone traps between 24 January 2003 and 27 February 2004 in the vegetables farm and between 24 March 2003 and 27 February 2004 in the carnation farm at Kampong Raja. They were captured all the time in the studied areas, although the numbers fluctuated. The highest number of adult catches per trap per day was 5.75 individuals between 6 to 13 June 2003, followed by 5.14 individuals between 23 to 30 May 2003 at the vegetables farm. The lowest number of adult catches per trap per day was 0.25 individuals between 3 to 10 October 2003. Whereas, at the carnation farm, the highest number of adult catches per trap per day was 1.22 individuals between 25 July to 8 August 2003. The lowest number of adult catches per trap per day was 0.06 individuals between 31 October to 7 November 2003 and 30 January to 6 February 2004. In general, capture increased towards the middle part of the year with four capture peaks occurring between April and June 2003 at the vegetables farm. Whilst, at the carnation farm, there were several capture peaks occurred between April and October 2003. Thus, this date could be used as a benchmark to determine when and if population levels are high enough to have the potential to cause economic damage to crops in Cameron Highlands, Pahang.

TI  - Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in sugarcane impact and implications for the Zimbabwe sugar industry
AB  - Eldana saccharina was first recorded in sugarcane in the Zimbabwe sugarcane industry in 1999. The Zimbabwe Sugar Association Experiment Station (ZSAES) initiated systematic E. saccharina surveys in its sugar industry in 2000. Survey records from 2000 to 2005 were analysed to determine the pest status of this stalk borer. The total area and the number of fields that were free of E. saccharina steadily decreased from around 50% in 2000 to less than 20% of the area under commercial sugarcane by 2005. Average E. saccharina damage in most of the fields surveyed was between 0.1% and 5.0% stalks bored. Carryover cane (&gt;12 months ratoon cane or &gt;14 months plant cane) in the industry increased during the period. Higher levels of damage (&gt;10% bored stalks) were found in older (&gt;13.5 months) and carryover cane. Locally bred varieties (ZN) had significantly more damage (p&lt;0.0001) compared to other varieties grown in the industry. There were significant differences (p&lt;0.0001) in E. saccharina damage levels among the different sugarcane estates. Mkwasine Estate and Hippo Valley Estates had the lowest damage levels, while farms in the out-grower schemes had the highest levels. It was estimated that the Zimbabwe Sugar Industry lost about 5000 tonnes of sugar, annually, to E. saccharina infestation.

TI  - Developing new baculovirus products or "how to walk a tightrope"
AB  - Baculoviruses are insect pathogenic viruses. Their narrow host range and the lack of toxicity and pathogenicity towards plants and vertebrates make them a suitable tool for the biological control of insect pests. The world-wide use of the codling moth granulovirus demonstrated that products based on baculoviruses can be successfully developed and commercialised. Based on this experience, new products based on nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) have been recently developed against important key pests such as Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera exigua and Spodoptera littoralis. In a scientific trial on tomato in Italy, the efficiency rate for HearNPV against H. armigera (HELICOVEX 7.51012 NPV/L) reached almost 90% and was significantly higher than for B.t. (E.r. 77%) and for Indoxacarb (E.r. 68%). In Spain, SpexNPV (SPEXIT 3.81012 OB/L) has been applied against S. exigua on sweet pepper. The application of SPEXIT in a 12 days interval resulted in a reduction of the larval population of almost 88%. At an interval of 6 days, the reduction was even 95% and by far more effective than by the treatment with B.t. (75%). The application of SpliNPV (LITTOVIR 21012 OB/L) revealed a similar efficacy against Spodoptera littoralis as B.t. However, the recent requirements for registration of biological control agents are hindering the commercialisation of new products based on baculoviruses. The costs for the registration dossiers and fees, as well as the time (years) required for dossier evaluation by the registration authorities are unreasonable. Therefore, to develop and to bring a new baculovirus product on the market was and still is a financial risk and a tightrope walk.

TI  - Genetic differentiation among cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) populations of south Indian cotton ecosystems using mitochondrial DNA markers
AB  - Genetic diversity among 12 cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) populations from different geographic regions of South India was done using mitochondrial DNA-specific markers. Thirteen selected mtDNA universal markers/primers generated a total of 167 PCR amplicons, of which 162 were polymorphic across all 12 populations. An average of 12.85 amplicons per primer was noted. All populations could be differentiated from one another using specific primers; specific band(s) could be potentially used to differentiate individual populations. Genetic relationships between the populations were evaluated by generating a similarity matrix based on Jaccard's index and a phenetic dendrogram was generated by UPGMA method. Principal component analysis separated the 12 populations into different groups based on band-sharing data. Populations showed varied degrees of genetic similarity within a range of 0.04-0.52. Also, the populations appeared to be more dispersed on the principal component plot indicating a wide genetic base. On a larger scale, genetic differences among populations appear to result from low dispersal rates between populations. The level of genetic variation detected between the H. armigera populations with mtDNA-PCR analysis suggests that it is an efficient marker technology for delineating genetic relationships amongst populations and estimating genetic diversity, thereby gaining insight into genetic structure of populations and its further use in formulation of appropriate area wide management strategies for this pest.

AB  - During 2000-06, the grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana) was studied in 9 vine zones of Castilla y Len (Spain) by pheromone traps. The number of normal generations of grapevine moth was three, although in some cases, there were only two or four, as in the case of D.O. Bierzo. The presence of grapevine moth was unequal between the studied areas. Zones with high grapevine moth occurrence included Cigales, Rueda, Toro, Tierra del Vino de Zamora and Tierras de Len. The increase in two of the zones, Tierra del Vino de Zamora and the D.O. Tierras de Len, was noted. A general increase from 2004 was observed. Generally, there was enough coincidence between times of maximum of flight throughout the years of study for the different zones.

TI  - Large infestation of chestnuts by Cydia moths in Madeira Island monitorization of Cydia splendana populations with pheromone lures
AB  - Chestnut fruits represent an important economic income for local populations of Madeira Island. In the last years, chestnut fruits have been heavily attacked by an unknown moth species. Since Cydia splendana - a carpophagous species common to chestnut fruits - has been reported to Madeira, three different commercial pheromones lures (Agrisense, Tomagro and Oecos) have been used to monitorize this species in three different localities. The subtropical conditions on this island seem to affect the phenology of populations. Large numbers of C. splendana were sampled from August to mid November, but the period of flight activity was longer than in continental areas. The peak of flight activity was comparatively late from the end of August to beginning of September. Oecos was the most efficient pheromone lure in the three localities studied. The infestation rates of fruits were large and varied from 13 to 40% but coloration and chetotaxia of larvae did not correspond to C. splendana. The variation observed in larvae in these structures can represent either patterns of intraspecific variation or the co-existence of different species. Further morphological studies should be done.

TI  - Study on the susceptibility of hazelnut cultivars to injuries caused by the European goat moth, Cossus cossus L. (Lepidoptera, Cossidae)
AB  - The study was carried out in hazelnut orchards in the region of Kardzhali during the period of 2000-2005. The present paper focuses on the development and the damages caused by the European goat moth, Cossus cossus L. that has become more serious problem in hazelnut orchards in the recent years. Surveys were conducted on 11 hazelnut cultivars with different origins. In Bulgaria, the major cultivars are grafted on C. colurna rootstock which has a high resistance to the main pests attacking the hazelnut crop. The results showed that some of the European cultivars with C. avellana origin (Gustafov and Uebov) are more susceptible to this pest species. The cultivars Rimski, Bademoviden and Ran Trapezundski were less attacked by the pest as compared to the European cultivars. In both cases no injuries were observed in the engrafting area. The damages do not depend on the plant growing vigor are not related to the late incompatibility, which is typical for the cultivars on C. colurna rootstock.

TI  - Mating disruption technique vs Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermller) (Tortricidae) 3 years of experience in vineyards of Abruzzo (Italy)
AB  - Since 2004 ARSSA is conducting a large scale trial (about 330 ha) with the application of mating disruption technique for the control of L. botrana. First three years results were positive on the whole in spite of the agronomical (cultivar, soil, etc.) and environmental (microclimate, wind, slope, etc.) variability typical of this grape growing area. Best results were achieved in large fields (&gt;10 ha) with espalier training system or, anyhow, on training system lower than overhead. A correct dispensers application (number/ha and timing of application) was an important factor for the success of this method. Organic grape growing showed a favourable condition for the mating disruption technique thanks to a good agro-ecosystem equilibrium (greater abundance of predators and parasitoids). Some critical situations emerged in sloping vineyards and/or in presence of high pest populations but, at the end, mating disruption gave positive results with a generalized reduction of insect pest infestations in comparison with conventional treated ones. In view of a rational approach of plant protection in vineyards, that seems to be nowadays more and more complex, mating disruption could represent, also in Abruzzo, an interesting alternative to traditional techniques for an adequate protection from infestation of L. botrana, offering, at the same time, the respect of the environment, the protection of the consumer health without penalizing farmer income.

TI  - Evidence for field evolved resistance to newer insecticides in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) from Pakistan
AB  - The toxicity of representative newer insecticides, which are being used widely in Pakistan, were investigated against various populations of Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) collected from three different districts for 3 consecutive years. For spinosad, resistance ratio compared with Lab-PK were in the range of 7-122-fold, 3-95-fold for indoxacarb, 4-186-fold for abamectin, 2-77-fold for emamectin and 13-224-fold for fipronil. The resistance ratio for insect growth regulator (IGR) tested was in the range of 2-66-fold for leufenuron, 8-56-fold for diflubenuron and 2-153-fold for methoxyfenozide. Paired wise comparisons of the log LC50s of insecticides tested for all the populations showed correlations among several insecticides, suggesting a cross-resistance mechanism. The most probable reason for low toxicity of these insecticides could also be the development of multiple resistance mechanisms; however, further studies are required to establish these mechanisms. When these same products were tested against a susceptible laboratory population (Lab-PK), emamectin and indoxacarb were significantly more toxic than other compounds tested. The results are discussed in relation to integrated pest management (IPM) for the S. litura with respect to unstable resistance in the field.

TI  - Field evaluations of concentrated spray applications of microencapsulated sex pheromone for codling moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - The application of a microencapsulated (MEC) sex pheromone formulation (Checkmate CM-F) for codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), in low volume, concentrated sprays was evaluated in a series of small plot and grower trials in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen, and pear, Pyrus communis L. Preliminary tests found that MEC sprays applied at 172-207 kilopascals in 12-23 liters/ha deposited the highest density of microcapsules per leaf. The addition of a latex sicker did not increase the deposition of microcapsules. Small plot tests in 2004 compared the effectiveness of two low-volume sprayers against a standard high-volume spray (926 liters/ha) applied at 1,379 kilopascals. Moth catches and fruit injury were significantly lower in plots treated with the low-volume sprays compared with plots treated with the standard sprayer. These results suggest that concentrating the MEC formulation increases the deposition of microcapsules and improves its effectiveness. Larger trials were conducted with a low-volume sprayer in 4-ha plots within commercial apple (2005-2006) and pear orchards (2005) paired with similar plots treated with hand-applied pheromone dispensers. Levels of fruit injury were not significantly different between pheromone treatments in any of the three tests. Moth catches, however, were significantly higher in the MEC-versus the dispenser-treated apple plots in 2005. No difference was found in the fruit injury levels in MEC-treated apple orchards in 2005 caused by irrigation method, but moth catches were significantly higher in overhead versus undertree orchards. The advantages and current limitations of using MEC sex pheromone sprays to supplement current grower's management strategies for codling moth is discussed.

TI  - Development under constant temperatures and seasonal prevalence in soybean field of the bean pyralid, Omiodes indicatus (Lepidoptera Crambidae)
AB  - The bean pyralid, Omiodes indicatus (Fabricius), moulted 4 times during larval period. When temperature increased from 15 to 20, 25, and 30C, the developmental period of immature stages was shortened; 18.2, 7.5, 5.0, and 4.1 days of egg period; 51.8, 20.0, 12.7, and 9.9 days of larval period; 29.5, 12.0, 8.0, and 5.9 days of pupal period, respectively. Adult longevity was 16.0, 14.7, 11.2, and 7.5 days at respective temperatures. A female adult layed 57.0, 63.3, 82.2, and 31.7 eggs in 3.7, 6.0, 5.8, and 3.0 days of oviposition period at the same temperature regimes, respectively. Field survey in 2006 and 2007 showed that leaf damage on paddy field and upland soybeans began to appear in mid July, reaching its peaks in mid August and late September. Adults of the bean pyralid appeared in mid July and peaked in late August and early October.

TI  - Feeding damage by Boarmia bistortata Goeze (Lep., Geometridae) in a pine stand in Bavaria. / Schden durch den Heidelbeerspanner Boarmia bistortata Goeze (Lep., Geometridae) in einem Kiefernbestand in Bayern
AB  - The geometrid moth Boarmia bistortata Goeze appears temporarily as a forest pest. In Bavaria, this insect species prefers older pine stands with blueberry. At first, the young larvae of Boarmia bistortata cause feeding damage on the blueberry bushes. Later on they climb up the pine trees and feed on needles of the previous years and even on new shoots in case of high population density. Mass propagations of this insect over several years lead to severe loss of vitality and partly high tree mortality in pine forests. Thinning of trees by the feeding larvae result in the occurrence of secondary pest insects like bark beetles and buprestid beetles. In case of mass propagation of Boarmia during several successive years, control measures will be necessary to save the pine stands. The special biology of this insect species makes a reliable and early risk assessment very difficult.

TI  - Evaluation of long-term mating disruption of Ephestia kuehniella and Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in indoor storage facilities by pheromone traps and monitoring of relative aerial concentrations of pheromone
AB  - The potential for pheromone-based mating disruption (MD) of Ephestia kuehniella (Walker) and Plodia interpunctella (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) was investigated in two flour mills and a pet food distributor. Plastic sachets emitting 2-3 mg per d (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate, the major pheromone component of both moth species, were used as MD dispensers, which were applied in grid systems resulting in one dispenser per 100 m3 of air volume. Pheromone traps with sticky inserts were used to monitor moth population fluctuations. To monitor pheromone levels in the air before, during, and after the treatment, electroantennographic (EAG) measurements were performed using a portable device. All localities showed decreased trap catches after application of MD. In two localities with low initial population densities, trap catches were reduced immediately after application of MD and remained very low, even several months after the MD treatment was terminated. In contrast, in a locality with a higher initial population density the reduction in trap catches was slower, and trap catches increased again soon after the termination of the MD treatment. Electrophysiological data showed not only increased aerial levels of pheromone during the treatment period but also levels that were higher than during pretreatment, even 12 mo after removal of MD dispensers. The localities had good ventilation, and the memory effect observed indicates that the pheromone adhered to surfaces that subsequently functioned as secondary dispensers. Customer complaints registered by one of the mills were 49% less in 2004, after 2 yr of MD compared with 2002, the year before the treatments began.

TI  - Control of European vine moth by mating disruption in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. / Lotta contro la tignoletta della vite con il metodo della confusione sessuale in Friuli Venezia Giulia
AB  - The European vine moth, Lobesia botrana, is the most dangerous pest in the flatland vineyards of the Gorizia province (northeastern Italy), where it has 3 generations a year. During 2000-07, trials with mating disruption were carried out using dispensers Isonel L (Shin-Etsu) at 500 dispensers/ha in 3 grape-growing areas with surfaces ranging from 3 to 61 ha. Except for the first 3 years and one locality in 2007, mating disruption showed higher efficacy than chemical control against both the carpophagous generations. The efficacy was mostly influenced by the population level during the previous generation. The economic advantage to use mating disruption occurs if no additional insecticides must be applied against other pests or in alternative if rewards or higher selling prices increase the gross proceeds in the farms that applied this control method.

TI  - Effect of weather parameters on population dynamics of three important pests in cotton at Bathinda Region of Punjab
AB  - The effects of weather parameters on the population dynamics of jassid, whitefly and spotted bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) on cotton (cultivars Ankur and White Gold) sown on 3 or 13 May 2005 were studied in Bathinda, Punjab, India, during the kharif of 2004-05. The jassid population increased until 30 July 2005 (1.68 per plant), then decreased. The accuracy of prediction of jassid population using regression equations was much lower when the analysis was based on maximum temperature, minimum temperature or mean temperature (up to 0.11, 0.16 and 0.21%, respectively) than when all the variables were considered (up to 84.0%). The whitefly was initially observed on 16 July 2005. The population of this insect increased until 23 July 2005 (2.46 per plant), then decreased. The accuracy of prediction of whitefly population was lower when the analysis was based on rainfall, morning relative humidity or mean relative humidity (0.33, 0.45 and 0.37%) than when all the variables were considered (97.0%). The spotted bollworm did not infest cotton until the end of July. The highest population densities of spotted bollworm were evident at the end of August (0.39 per plant) and first week of September (0.48 per plant). The accuracy of prediction of spotted bollworm density was greater when rainfall, morning relative humidity and mean relative humidity were all considered in the analysis (89%) than when only one of these variables was used (33, 45 and 35%, respectively).

TI  - Waves and synchrony in Epirrita autumnata/Operophtera brumata outbreaks. I. Lagged synchrony regionally, locally and among species
AB  - In 1990-2003, during a complete 10-year outbreak cycle, the synchrony of the birch defoliating outbreaks of the geometrids Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata was studied quantitatively in the northern part of the Fennoscandian mountain chain (the Scandes). Data were supplemented with similar data from 1964 to 1966 and historical information. A 30-year series of field data from one locality in southern Scandes made possible interregional comparisons. In 1991, outbreaks started in north-eastern Fennoscandia and moved westward like a wave and reached the outer coast of north-western Norway in about 2000. This wave is a new observation. In the same years, a previously documented outbreak wave moved southward along the Scandes. Outbreak periods have usually occurred around the middle of each decade. Seemingly unrelated population peaks at the decadal shift 2000 were reported from islands at the coast of north-western Norway. They are shown here to have been the final ripples of the east-west wave. At some localities, O. brumata peaked 2 years after E. autumnata. A lag of 1 or 2 years also occurred at the locality in southern Scandes. This interspecific time lag is a new observation. In accordance with the north-south wave, a time-lag of 1-2 years occurred between the fluctuations of northern and southern E. autumnata and O. brumata populations. The population peak of E. autumnata occurred 1 year earlier at one locality than at a nearby locality. This pattern and particular altitudinal shifts of the O. brumata population density at these localities repeated in two outbreak periods. This indicates that, for example, local climate may modify outbreak synchrony between nearby localities. At the same localities, O. brumata peaked first at one altitude and 1 or 2 years later at another altitude. This vertical lag is a new observation. E. autumnata shows fluctuation traits similar to some other cyclic animals, e.g. the larch budmoth in the European Alps, some European tetraonid birds and the Canadian snow-shoe hare. These similarities (and dissimilarities) in intra- and interspecific synchronies and causes of E. autumnata and O. brumata synchronies, regionally, locally and among the two species are discussed.

TI  - Dieback and recovery in poplar and attack by the hornet clearwing moth, Sesia apiformis (Clerck) (Lepidoptera Sesiidae)
AB  - A survey of 801 poplar trees in central east England in 1999 demonstrated a correlation between crown dieback and infestation by hornet clearwing moth (Sesia apiformis), induced by a period of drought in 1995-1996. To determine whether trees colonised by S. apiformis would subsequently deteriorate and die or whether they could recover despite infestation and damage to the stem, all trees in the original survey were re-assessed in 2001, 2003 and 2005. The repeat surveys showed that trees with 70% or less crown dieback in 1999 replaced their canopy and generally improved by 2005, irrespective of the numbers of S. apiformis in the stem, whereas trees that had 75% or more crown dieback in 1999 either died or declined further. The presence of S. apiformis did not prevent tree recovery, and there was little evidence that infestation slowed the rate of recovery. Populations of S. apiformis, measured in terms of the numbers of adult emergence holes visible in the base of the trees, decreased between 2001 and 2005 at the same time as the amount of dieback visible in the canopy of the poplars markedly decreased. However, the fall in numbers of emergence holes at this time reflected a decline in larval establishment 2-3 years earlier, and indicated that the moth population had responded to a more rapid restoration in the internal state of the trees, which was not reflected immediately by the gradual replacement of dead branches and reduction in dieback symptoms.

TI  - Agrotis segetum in Denmark first signs of global climate change
AB  - The acceptance of global warming and related climate change is increasing among climatologists. In Denmark this will, apart from increases in temperature, lead to more unpredictable growing seasons, including the pattern of precipitation. Records of six consecutive years of extremely low Agrotis segetum occurrence in crops in 1999-2005 make it pertinent to compare them with records from 1905-1979, which contain no examples of more than two consecutive years with a very low level of infestation. The very low level of cutworm occurrence in 1999-2005 can be explained by the mortality of young larvae due to low temperatures and moist soil, which has been demonstrated experimentally. What is particularly striking is that never, in the previous 100 years, have so many consecutive seasons provided the same detrimental conditions for young cutworms during first half of July. The only obvious reason seems to be the changing climate which could, however, also change to promote cutworm survival, if the predicted risk of summer drought occurred during two consecutive years. The results of monitoring with pheromone traps during the recent extended period of low cutworm abundance also indicate that the background population is always large enough to cause local infestations of economic significance. Therefore, monitoring should not be abandoned, even after several seasons of low cutworm abundance.

TI  - Changes in the population density and in the specific structure of parasitoid assemblages of the horse chestnut leafminer (Cameraria ohridella) at different localities in the period of 2001-2003. / A vadgesztenyelevl-aknzmoly (Cameraria ohridella) populciinak s parazitoid-kzssgeinek vltozsai klnbzolohelyeken 2001 s 2003 kztt
AB  - Three years' field studies were conducted between 2001 and 2003 at four different locations in North-West Hungary. One location was situated near a village, three in a flood plain close to the river Danube. There was no significant difference in infestation levels by Cameraria ohridella on common horse chestnut trees but the rate of the parasitism and the number of the parasitoid species was higher in the village area. Fluctuation in the population density of the moth and its parasitoids was explained by changing weather conditions. Rigorous winters can increase parasitoid mortality, resulting in decreased parasitism in the following season (depending on habitat structures), while higher average daily temperatures, longer daily sunshine durations and less precipitation in the summer may reduce the population density of the moth. Former hypothesis of the authors about a non-migrating, quasi-stable parasitoid community of the moth was confirmed by comparing weekly parasitism rates during three consecutive years. Presumably, the horse-chestnut trees in the flood plain were infested later, what becomes visible both in the levels and the annual changes of parasitism and in the specific structure of the parasitoid communities. The vegetation structure of the habitat also plays an important role in determining the specific structure of the parasitoid community.

TI  - Is there a link between fruit pest phenology and climate change in Belgium? A comparative overview with the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), as a case study
AB  - Pest populations dynamics in perennial fruit crops show yearly changes, with a tendency to elongating phenologies in Belgium in recent years. We investigate over 50 years of data from the Royal Research Station of Gorsem to test two possible causes for this prolongation (1) climatic changes and (2) shift from classical to integrated pest control. As most pests have temperature dependent phenologies, persistent climate changes must have an immediate effect on pest manifestation. Since the mid-eighties, average temperatures in spring and summer have risen consistently. On the other hand, the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies might act as a selective force favouring early or late morphs of a given pest. Corrective spraying is indeed often aimed at peaks of pest outbreaks only. Low pest occurrence prior or after this peak might escape chemical control and partial control by beneficial organisms. We gathered data from abundant pest species in specific orchards that where monitored either 20 years (12 orchards throughout Belgium) or 50 years (orchards near Gorsem). Available life history parameters (emergence, egg-laying, peak of flights, abundance ...) were related to climatology and specific management strategies. The phenology of a majority of pests follows climatic changes in mean spring temperatures, a trend that started in the early eighties in Belgium. Phenology changes do not correspond with the key shift towards IPM in the late eighties and early nineties, though we cannot exclude a partial added effect. Phenology elongation has consequences on IPM strategies and crop protection management. In the case of the codling moth, earlier start of flights and later end of the sole generation in Belgium necessitates at least one extra chemical application to obtain full control.

TI  - The influence of sour radiation on the development of forest insects. / Wpyw promieniowania sonecznego na rozwj szkodliwych owadw lenych
AB  - The mass outbreaks of pest insects occurring in many countries on different continents have not been sufficiently explained so far. The causes have mainly been seen in abiotic factors, insect physiology and even in genetics. A hypothesis was put forward some years ago that there might have been, in addition to the said factors, a number of less apparent causes, such as solar radiation that might have had a significant effect on many biological processes. The occurrences of mass outbreaks of forest insects suggest that there is a correlation between the intensified activity of sunspots and the development of insect populations. Over the last 100 and 200 years, outbreaks of nun moth (Lymantria monacha L.), (Panolis flammea Schaff.), (Dendrolimus pini L.) and many other insect species have been reported in Polish forests. The highest nun moth population abundances occurred in the years 1806-1809, 1916, 1927-1930, 1837-1841, 1892-1898, 1908-1912, 1933-1938, 1945-1952, 1955-1960, 1962-1968, 1970-1975, 1978-1985, 1991-1994, 1999-2000, usually one or two years after the maximum of sunspot activity (about the Wolf number 150) which fell on the years 1837, 1848, 1870, 1947, 1957-1959, 1979-1981, 1990. The intensified solar activity cycle varies between 7 and 17 years, the average cycle being 11 years. A similar 11-year periodicity in the Sun's activity was sought in the mass occurrence of pest insects (e.g. nun moth) which was confirmed in a number of cases. However due to various factors, an inter-outbreak cycle was slightly different and was 6-10 years or more. It should be emphasized that natural environmental factors (i. a. abiotic and biotic) are a barrier limiting insect reproduction. These factors can, in a short time, lead to a very quick reduction in the population density of active pest insects.

TI  - Evolution of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), resistance in Swiss orchards, tested by topical application of insecticides
AB  - Since 1996, resistant strains of codling moth Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) have appeared in insecticides treated orchards in Switzerland. From then, observations of more or less resistant populations have been recorded, on an increasing surface. Since the first resistant moth appears in an orchard, further treatments with insecticides (mainly IGRs) keep on killing sensitive moths when the population of resistant codling moth increases in time, sometimes reaching high levels of insensitivity to classical treatments. A good pest control management combining mating disruption and CpGv (granulosis virus) can efficiently reduce population size within a few years. Resistance levels of C. pomonella diapausing larvae have been evaluated for several years using topical application of different insecticides. Larvae collected in autumn in sensitive and resistant populations from several orchards are treated with one l drop of insecticide at a discriminating dose, and laid on the back of the larvae. Larvae are then allowed to hide in corrugated cardboards and reared into climatic chambers until adult emergence. Survival rate is calculated compared to control. This method allowed a survey of orchards populations over several years, often from quite resistant stages until after some years of mating disruption. At that time, population sizes often reach extremely low levels, making difficult the collecting of diapausing larve for tests. However, topical application tests made possible the observation of changes in sensitivity since the release of insecticide selection pressure on populations. Indeed, obvious recuperation was visible within a 5-years period of mating disruption technique.

TI  - Response of Great Tits Parus major to an irruption of a Pine Processionary Moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa population with a shifted phenology
AB  - Since 1997, a population of the Pine Processionary Moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa exhibited a shifted life cycle in a restricted area of a managed pine forest, at the central west coast of Portugal. Rather than during the regular winter period, larval development of this novel population occurs during the summer. We indicate the populations accordingly as the Winter Population (WP) and the Summer Population (SP). We quantified the numerical response of Great Tits Parus major to irruptions of the SP. In the years following an irruption, Great Tits were more abundant in the SP area, than in two similar non-infested forest areas. This was particularly pronounced during summer and autumn, at the time when moths, eggs and larvae of the SP were available for bird predation. A nestbox study allowed us to verify that the SP moth emergence period coincided with egg laying and raising of second broods in Great Tits, and higher reproductive rates were recorded in the SP than in the WP area. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document a response of a bird predator to a local T. pityocampa irruption, which was even more special as it concerned an insect population with a large shift in its life cycle. Our results show that the Great Tit is able to respond to local outbreaks of forest defoliator insects, and we suggest a potential impact of Great Tit predation on the population dynamics of the SP.

TI  - Investigation of presence, distribution and flight period of oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana (Lep. Tortricidae) using pheromone traps in Kurdistan province
AB  - Forests cover about 5 200 000 ha of the west of Iran, from which 500 000 ha are located in Kurdistan province. One of the most important pests in the oak forests of this province is the oak leaf roller moth Tortrix viridana. This pest significantly damages the oak forest each year. The use of pheromone traps is one of the suitable methods for monitoring of this pest. In this study, the distribution and flight period of the pest were studied by pheromone traps during 2 years. Fifteen regions were trapped at the equal distances (40 km) from Kamyaran (south west of Kurdistan province) to Baneh (north west of Kurdistan province) to investigate the presence and distribution of this moth. Also, a region located between Sanandaj and Marivan was selected to study the flight period. Some traps were established in this region and checked every 2 days. Investigations of pest distribution showed that the oak leaf roller moth was present all over the sites from Kamyaran to Baneh. Different moth populations were trapped in all over the sites. The highest population was trapped in Colit region (midwest of Kurdistan province). The study of the flight period showed that first moths were trapped on 16 May and the peak of the flight took place on 21 May and finally the last moths were trapped on 24 June. Therefore, adults activated during 40 days and mating and oviposition occurred during this period. Incubation period lasted 9 months and activation of larvae was coincident with the flashing of foliar buds.

TI  - Monitoring population dynamics of tomato fruit borer, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner moths through pheromone traps in Uttaranchal Hills
AB  - Studies were carried out at the College of Forestry and Hill Agriculture, Ranichauri, Uttaranchal, India, during 2004 and 2005 on the monitoring population dynamics of tomato fruit borer, Helicoverpa armigera, moths through synthetic sex pheromone traps. The number of moths trapped varied overtime. Relatively higher number of moths was trapped during March-April. Peak of moth population was recorded during third and fourth week of April during 2004 and 2005, respectively. After attaining the peak, the moths possibly migrate to other areas of crop which attained susceptible stage.

TI  - The spread and the harmfulness of Cydia pomonella L. in apple plantations of Jablanica District. / Rasprostranjenost i tetnost Cydia pomonella L. u zasadima jabuke Jablanikog okruga
AB  - The research was performed in during 2001-02, by monitoring the dynamics and determining the number and density of the apple codling moth population (Cydia pomonella) in the Jablanica district, Serbia, to provide the basic data about the spread and harmfulness of this kind of insect in this territory. By examination of phenology of apple codling moth butterfly flight in various environmental conditions, attention was drawn to the importance of pest production in determining the optimal deadlines of suppression. There are exceptions in the time of butterfly occurrence during one year on different locations, and during different years within the same location. The larger number of butterflies and greater continuity of butterfly flight was established during the year 2003 on all locations compared to 2001. The number of caught butterflies per pheromone trap was larger in 2002, and on some locations it was twice as high. The symptoms of damage are characteristic, easily recognizable, and they occur on apple fruits. They can be of primary character (worm-eaten fruit, deformation and premature falling off of apple fruits) and of secondary character (worm-eaten fruits facilitate the entrance of pathogenic organisms, which causes the fruit to decay).

TI  - Distribution, pest status and agro-climatic preferences of lepidopteran stem borers of maize in Kenya
AB  - Lepidopterous stem borers are the main field insect pests that attack maize, Zea mays L. in tropical Africa. A survey was carried during the long and short rain cropping seasons of 2002/2003 across six main agro-climatic zones (ACZs) to determine the spatial distribution of important stem borer species in Kenya. A total of 474 visits were made in the seventy-eight localities conveniently chosen to represent each of the six ACZs. 189 600 stems were checked for infestation, of which 27 799 infested stems were destructively cut and dissected for stem borer larvae identification. An average of 1.4 stem borer larvae were recovered per infested plant. 54.5% of the recovered larvae were identified as Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Crambidae), 39.7% as Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Noctuidae), 4.5% as Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Noctuidae) and 0.8% as Chilo orichalcociliellus (Strand) (Crambidae). Minor species present included Eldana saccharina Walker (Pyralidae), Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) (Noctuidae), Sesamia cretica Lederer (Noctuidae), Sesamia sp. (Noctuidae), Sciomesa piscator Fletcher (Noctuidae), Busseola sp. near phaia (Noctuidae), Chilo sp., Ematheudes sp. 1 (Pyralidae) and Ematheudes sp. 2 (Pyralidae). Farms were grouped into respective ACZs for statistical analysis and subsequent comparison of dominant species. Results indicated that B. fusca was the dominant stem borer species in high potential zones (highland tropics, moist transitional zone and moist midaltitude) while the exotic C. partellus dominated smallholder farms in low potential zones (dry midaltitude, dry transional and lowland tropical zone). Within each ACZs, there was evidence of variation in species proportions between seasons. These spatio-temporal differences in community structure are discussed in terms of agro-climatic biological adaptations.

TI  - Caterpillar traps study 2006 species spectrum of moths on deciduous trees. / Raupenfallen-Untersuchung 2006 Artenspektrum von Schmetterlingen an Laubbumen
AB  - After the regionally observed increasing caterpillar defoliation of 2003 and 2004 in east and south Austria, a first time survey of species and their density, using simply constructed collection traps, was carried out in 2005 within the Federal Research and Training Centre for Forests, Natural Hazards and Landscape (BFW), Vienna. In 2006, the collection method was improved, and the survey was increased from four traps to nine traps of approximately 3 m 4 m, and positioned beneath seven tree species (Carpinus betulus). The reduced caterpillar fitness observed in 2005 and the resultant failure in successful hatching led to a major drop in the numbers collected 2006. The result showed that there were 2726 Lepidoptera caterpillars collected, the majority of which were of the Geometridae family such as Winter Moth. The connection between trap result and crown volume revealed inconsistencies.

TI  - Boring effect of carpenterworms (Lepidoptera Cossidae) on sap exudation of the oak, Quercus acutissima
AB  - Sap often exudes from the trunks of the oak, Quercus acutissima. Carpenterworms (Lepidoptera, Cossidae) are frequently observed at these sap sites and believed to be involved in exudation. Field observations from 2002 to 2004 showed that 20-40% of all patches (exuding spots on trees) harbored these insects and that roughly 20% of all patches had only their nests. The peak period of carpenterworm abundance corresponded to the peak number of patches harboring them in all 3 years (August 2002, September 2003, and July 2004). Patches with carpenterworms or their nests had a wider surface area and exuded more sap than patches without them or their nests. Moreover, their experimental removal resulted in decreased exudate quantity, indicating that these insects promote exudation. These results suggest that carpenterworms contribute greatly to sap exudation through wood boring and that their distribution and abundance affect sap resources.

TI  - Effects of orchard host plants (apple and peach) on development of oriental fruit moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - Studies were designed to examine the effects of host plants (apple, Malus domestica Borkh., and peach, Prunus persica L.) on the development of oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae). Oriental fruit moth larvae developed faster on peach than on apple, both on fruit as well as on growing terminal shoots. On fruit, these differences were shown to cause significant changes in both the rate (~20-60 degree-days earlier emergence on peach than on apple) and patterns of adult emergence among several cultivars of peaches and apples. Slopes of female emergence plots varied by host in 2003, with emergence occurring over a longer period on peach cultivars than on apple cultivars (with one exception). Slopes of male emergence curves did not differ by cultivar in 2003. These host-driven effects could impact the efficacy of traditional pest management approaches and probably complicate efforts to predictively model G. molesta populations in mixed cultivar orchards. Such developmental effects may help to explain previously observed differences in patterns of pheromone trap captures in peach versus apple orchards. Host-associated effects should be incorporated into future models to develop more realistic predictive tools and thus improve integrated pest management efforts.

TI  - Blackbutt leafminer damage to high value eucalypt species in Northland
AB  - Blackbutt leafminer (Acrocercops laciniella) is a small moth whose larvae cause leafmines in a wide range of Eucalyptus species. It was introduced to New Zealand from Australia and first recorded in 1999, spreading rapidly throughout North Island and was detected in South Island in June 2004. This study was designed to evaluate levels of damage to a range of species, monitor changes in levels of damage over time and to compare levels of damage in different species. Prime hardwood timber species were chosen including blackbutt (E. pilularis), yellow stringybark (E. muelleriana), white stringybark (E. globoidea), blue-leaves stringybark (E. agglomerata), tallowwood (E. microcorys) and E. maculata. Single branches were cut from the upper crown of 6 trees (5 to 8-year-old) within stands of each species near Kerikeri and leaves removed. Leaves (100) were scored for damage on the basis of (1) no damage, (2) less than 25% damage, (3) between 25-50% damage, (4) between 50-75% damage, (5) greater than 75% damage. Three foliage collections were conducted in the first year 2004 in March, July and November. Four assessments were made in the second and third years. Blackbutt is the most susceptible species with high levels of damage but damage was high in all species except E. microcorys and E. maculata. Damage appears to increase with exposure to the wind. Peaks in damage occur during late summer and early winter.

TI  - Host plant-associated population variation in the carob moth Ectomyelois ceratoniae in Iran a geometric morphometric analysis suggests a nutritional basis
AB  - The carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller, 1839) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae), is the most important pest of pomegranate in Iran. As it has been rarely recorded on other host plants, control methods have mostly been focused on its populations on pomegranate. In this study, shapes and sizes of wings were compared in populations on 4 host plants (pomegranate, fig, pistachio and walnut) using a landmark-based geometric morphometric method, and analysis of partial warp scores and centroid sizes. The results showed significantly smaller wing size in populations on pomegranate and a significant host plant-associated shape difference among populations as a consequence of allometric growth. This suggests that the wing size and shape differences among test populations may not have a genetic basis and could happen because of differences in the nutritional content of host plants. The results of the analysis suggest that the female carob moth lays her eggs on host plants that provide suitable conditions for hatching. The larger size of moths on hosts other than pomegranate showed that some host plants such as fig, pistachio and walnut can provide for increased stored nutritional reserves by larvae that may result in more successful over-wintering and higher fecundity in adults. This suggests that in spite of the more extensive activity of carob moth on pomegranate in Iran, populations on other host plants can have an important effect on expanding pest population sizes in following years which should be considered in control methods.

TI  - Implications of an unintended area-wide IPM for Chilo suppressalis in Japan
AB  - This paper discusses the success of an unintended area-wide integrated pest management (IPM) for Chilo suppressalis in Japan. Chilo was considered as one of the country's major rice insect pests that caused significant yield loss during the pre-war period, along with Scirpophaga incertulas. Chilo population density declined through the years, which was believed to be caused by modern farming technologies associated with various improved agronomic practices, particularly farm mechanization, primarily aimed at increasing rice production and saving labor rather than decreasing Chilo population. Based on the case of Japan, the following are other factors associated with the low population of Chilo (a) the duration of the IPM scheme, either intended (planned) or unintended, that should at least cover a full decade (10 years); (b) the width of the area that could cover population displacement of Chilo stem borers; and (c) IPM of key pests could be implemented to complement modern farming technologies. It was also noted that environmental factors associated with the maintenance of low density of Chilo must be considered in developing rice management strategy to avoid extinction of the species which is not considered a pest anymore. This includes maintaining a balance between IPM and conservation of the paddy ecosystem, also known as the integrated biodiversity management (IBM).

TI  - Trap catches and seasonal incidence of Spodoptera litura on cauliflower and tomato
AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the seasonal incidence of Spodoptera litura on cauliflower (cv. Selection-4) and tomato (cv. Pusa Ruby) using trap catches. The earliest moth catch was obtained during the 6th standard week, immediately after appearance of overwintered moths, a gradual increase was observed up to the 19th standard week with the peak activity of 1143 moths per trap per week corresponding to the maximum temperature of 39.5C and minimum temperature of 20.7C. Moth activity started declining after the 42nd standard week and at the 48th standard week ceased completely. The adult population fluctuated between 20th and 43rd standard week. Thereafter, a sharp decline was observed and no moth could be trapped from 49th standard week onwards up to 5th standard week. The larval activity of S. litura on tomato was recorded from the 14th standard week, but no larvae were found during that period on tomato. The larvae started appearing from the 17h standard week. A gradual increase in the larval population was recorded until the 25th standard week. Larval population declined gradually after the 27th standard week at the time of crop harvest. The peak population was observed during the 25th standard week. However, in the case of cauliflower, the larvae could be seen from 36th standard week onwards in a fluctuating manner and the larval population attained its peak during the 43rd standard week. Thereafter, it declined gradually after the 46th standard week and no larvae were recorded at 49th standard week and onwards until crop harvest. Among the meteorological variables correlated with pest activity, only temperature showed significant influence on the moth catch and larval population of cauliflower. The number of moths per trap per week exhibited significant positive correlation with maximum and minimum temperature, whereas the larval population on cauliflower showed positive correlation with mean minimum temperature.

TI  - The simulation of outbreak area of winter moth (Operophtera brumata L. 1758) in predicted weather change in Slovakia. / Modelovn gradanho arelu pdalky podzimn (Operophtera brumata L. 1758) pri predpokldanch zmench klimatu na Slovensku
AB  - Spatial distribution of winter moth (Operophlera brumata L.) in relation to climatic conditions has been studied in Slovakia. Previous gradient analyses defined soil moisture, temperature/elevation, and presence of Quercus petraea and absence of Q. cerris as key factors which influence spatial distribution of this moth species. Algorithm model which synthesized individual parameters was used to calculate probability of outbreaks. The GIS interpretation of models suggested that size of optimum area (where defoliation might occur) was inversely related to simulated temperature. The largest optimum area (83,352 ha) resulted from model with long-term normal temperatures (calculated from temperatures prior the temperature increase in the 1980s). The temperature increased by 1C resulted to decrease of potential optimal area by 75% (optimum only at 22,217 ha). Increase of temperature by 2C (from normal) led to almost the diminishing of outbreak area (optimum only at 2,129 ha). The results found are discussed.

TI  - Application of biorational pesticides on nursery trees against Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton in Sicily the effects on different citrus species
AB  - In Sicily (Italy), citrus trees are cultivated in nursery conditions both for new plantation and for ornamental purposes. Since 1995, sicilian citrus nursery growers considered the citrus leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton [Lepidoptera Gracillariidae] one of the most important pest in citrus nurseries, and normally about 20 chemical applications per year are conducted in order to maintain citrus leafminer populations at low level. In previous years, several biorational pesticides for the control of citrus leafminer P. citrella were compared for testing their compatibility with integrated pest management (IPM)-programs under nursery conditions in Sicily. Based on encouraging results, in 2002-2004, biorational pesticides were utilized, on large scale trials, for testing their effects on citrus plant growth. Repeated sprays of horticultural Narrow-Range oils and azadirachtin were applied on 4800 two-years lemon, orange, mandarin, kumquat and lime trees in replicated blocks, cultivated in protected conditions. The physiological effects on tree flushing pattern and growth was periodically monitored and compared with the presence of citrus leafminer mines. The presence of natural parasites was recorded with yellow sticky traps. On average, lemon trees resulted the most infested species compared with orange and kumquat; mandarin and lime were slightly infested. On average, the yearly mean percentage of flushing trees was greater in lemon, mandarin and orange, compared with kumquat and lime. In 2003, trunk diameter growth was reduced on kumquat. In 2002, percentage of leaf area damage, caused by P. citrella, was higher on lemon. The presence of Eulophid parasitoids was not excluded.

TI  - The horse chestnut leafminer (Cameraria ohridella Deschka et Dimic 1986) in Europe. / A vadgesztenyelevl-aknzmoly (Cameraria ohridella Deschka and Dimic 1986) Eurpban
AB  - The horse chestnut tree (Aesculus hippocastanum) was introduced in 1576 from its original range of distribution, South-Easter Europe to central and western parts of the continent. Until roughly two decades ago, at least from the point of view of insect pests, horse chestnut trees had been ranked among the healthiest garden trees ever planted. The situation changed dramatically in 1984 with the arrival of the horse chestnut leafminer (C. ohridella). Spreading very rapidly, the moth has established over major parts of the European range of A. hippocastanum and is still expanding its area. Compared to other leafminer pests, C. ohridella is special for two reasons. First, the density of the larvae in the mines far exceeds that of closely related species. Second, infestation level of the trees has not declined until recently due to natural enemies and the moth is able to maintain epidemic population densities in a long run. Due to the conspicuous nature of the infestation, the new species soon aroused public interest, becoming target of intensive research. C. ohridella is now undoubtedly one of the best known insect pests in many European countries. Current paper provides a review about the knowledge gained in the past 20 years, dealing with many aspects of its life cycle (biology), seasonal activity (phenology), distribution, history of origin, and natural enemies. The authors also give a summary of the currently available control methods and encourage further investigations to develop more efficient and inexpensive ways to control the horse chestnut leafminer, without posing environmental hazard or threatening the health of the trees.

TI  - Impact of starvation on immune defense and other life history traits of an outbreaking geometrid, Epirrita autumnata a possible causal trigger for the crash phase of population cycle
AB  - Outbreaking populations of the autumnal moth, Epirrita autumnata, are regularly facing a shortage of food and starvation. We found that starvation led to a prolonged larval development and a marked reduction in pupal weights. A decrease in female pupal weight caused a 50% decrease in the realized fecundity. Due to starvation the melanotic encapsulation rate decreased but the activity of PO - a key enzyme in the melanotic pathway that may indicate scarcity of PO substrates due to starvation - increased. Our results suggested that the shortage of food during high-density years reduce markedly the fecundity of E. autumnata, and may also reduce the ability of the autumnal moth to resist parasitoids and pathogens. Altogether, starvation may potentially destabilize the pathogen dynamics of insects and may be a proximate reason for moth population crashes.

TI  - The ecology of Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in the Riverina region of south-eastern Australia and the implications for tactical and strategic management
AB  - Decisions on the choice of appropriate tactical and strategic control techniques require an understanding of the seasonal distribution and ecology of the target species. To address this need, data were collected from 1997 to 2000 using crop surveys, field sampling and pheromone trapping to monitor the population trends of Helicoverpa armigera (Hbner) and H. punctigera (Wallengren) in the Riverina region of south-eastern Australia. The data gathered are compared to predictions from the HElicoverpa Armigera and Punctigera Simulation (HEAPS) model, that simulates Helicoverpa population dynamics to assist in identifying the drivers of regional populations and provide a framework to make informed decisions. The results highlight the contrasting seasonal dynamics of H. punctigera and H. armigera within the region. Helicoverpa punctigera populations peak in the spring, driven by large scale spring migration into the region and subsequently decline. Helicoverpa armigera populations, conversely, are characterized by a period of spring recruitment of adults from overwintering pupae within the region, followed by a within-season population increase leading to severe late season pressure. The within-season increase of H. armigera is a result of the succession of crop and noncrop hosts with the main driver being sequentially sown, unsprayed maize. Tactical and strategic management options are discussed in light of these findings.

TI  - A tree in the eyes of a moth - temporal variation in oak leaf quality and leaf-miner performance
AB  - When examined at any moment in time, different parts of an individual oak tree exhibit almost as large differences in quality as different trees. But how consistent are such patterns in time? In this paper, we use intraclass correlations to assess the temporal consistency of host plant quality at several spatial scales. As measures of quality, we use both individual chemical attributes (phenolic contents) and the overall performance (larval survival) of the host-specific leaf-miner Tischeria ekebladella. Concentrations of 24 phenolic compounds were monitored on seven trees throughout a season. Variation in mine initiation and larval survival rates was assessed for individuals transplanted to another set of trees early versus later in the season, while year-to-year variation in larval survival was studied through stratified surveys of wild individuals during three years. At all time scales considered, measures of host quality were moderately consistent a tree favourable in quality at one point in time often remained so, but there was abundant variation around this relationship (=0.4-0.6). One hierarchical level deviated from this general pattern on individual branches, larval survival rates varied randomly among years (=0). Our study suggests that the quality of trees, and in particular of smaller units within trees, may be difficult to predict both in space and in time. To account for this, insects might benefit from adopting a bet-hedging strategy when selecting resources.

TI  - Population monitoring of the pine processionary moth (Lepidoptera Thaumetopoeidae) with pheromone-baited traps
AB  - A series of tests were carried out to design pheromone-based monitoring of the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). In a dose-response field test the number of male captures increased significantly with the dosage of pityolure to a plateau approximately 10 mg. The activity of pheromone dispensers persisted for at least 11 weeks, enough to cover the entire flight period of T. pityocampa. In a comparison of several saturating and non-saturating trap designs, plate sticky traps always showed the highest trapping efficiency. Captures were significantly higher in regularly cleaned traps than in traps without cleaning, and at tree canopy height; however, the latter were positively correlated with captures from traps positioned at breast height. The relationship between the number of PPM males captured in pheromone traps and the density of winter nests was investigated in 14 stands of the maritime pine (Pinus maritima [P. pinaster]) using 10 traps baited with low doses of pityolure. Mean trap captures calculated from 3 traps schemes to 10 traps were significantly correlated with nest density, indicating that four plate sticky traps baited with 0.2 mg of pityolure would provide a cost-effective tool for monitoring population densities of PPM per hectare. The reliability of this design was tested in 33 pine stands of different age and tree species across a range of geographic regions (France, Italy, Portugal), both in the core and expansion areas of the pest. The results were remarkably consistent, showing significant and positive correlations between mean male captures per day and total number of winter nests per hectare irrespective of the regions. The correlations with the level of infestation in the following generation was also positive for all regions although less significant. Our findings suggest that pheromone-baited traps provide a suitable tool for monitoring of T. pityocampa populations.

TI  - Seasonal trend of flight activity of the pearl millet stemborer Coniesta ignefusalis (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) as indicated by pheromone trap catches and its relationship with weather factors at Samaru, Nigeria
AB  - A water-oil based pheromone trap was used to monitor seasonal population changes of C. ignefusalis in millet-based cropping systems at Samaru, Zaria, Nigeria for three consecutive seasons (1997, 1998 and 1999). Daily meteorological data were obtained from the Meteorological Unit of the Institute for Agricultural Research, Samaru, Zaria, for the monitoring period. Two population peaks were observed in early August and September in 1997 and 1998. The first population peak in August 1997 was earlier and bigger than the one in 1998. A delayed emergence of the insects was observed in 1999 when only one population peak occurred and this was smaller than those in 1997 and 1998. Using step-wise multiple regression analyses, the relationship between pheromone trap catches of male moths and weather factors was assessed separately for each year to determine which of the weather factors contributed most to the insect population changes. Solar radiation in the preceding 10 days and minimum air temperature in the preceding 40 and 50 days explained 84.9% of the variance in population changes and flight activity of male moths in 1997. Wind direction and speed in the preceding 20 and 60 days respectively accounted for 80.6% of the variance in 1998, while maximum air temperature and relative humidity in the preceding 40 and 20 days respectively explained 99.9% of the variance in 1999. The functional regression equations developed involving these weather factors adequately predicted the changes in each year.

TI  - Corn borers (Lepidoptera Noctuidae; Crambidae) in Nortwestern Spain population dynamics and distribution
AB  - Corn borers are an important maize (Zea mays L.) pest in northwestern Spain. In order to use methods of control or to breed plant material against corn borers it is necessary to know the life cycle and behavior of this pest. The objectives of this work were to complete the study of the incidence of corn borers in northwestern Spain, to study the behavior of the two species of corn borers inside the plant, and to relate the abundance of borers with climatic factors. To monitor the incidence of the corn borers, data were taken in four localities of the northwest of Spain, during seven years (1997-2003). Sesamia nonagrioides is the most important pest in the coast. Ostrinia nubilalis is as important as S. nonagrioides in the inlands. There were two generations of both borers but a third generation can occur. Damage could hardly be predicted from studying the abundance of adults. S. nonagrioides and O. nubilalis had the same distribution inside the plant and it seems that both species can coexist.

AB  - The changes in the flight activity of the European corn borer (O. nubilalis) in Hungary are presented in two connecting papers. This part deals with the biomathematical analysis of alterations in the population densities of the European corn borer due to climate change. The studies were conducted by evaluating the data on catches of the pest by the national light trap network in 1991-2004. Conclusions were drawn to the annual flight activity and the trends in its changes in Hungary using the light trap data recorded in four distinctive areas of the country.

TI  - From population to species morphological and molecular diversity in east African stem borer species of the genus Manga Bowden 1956 (Lepidoptera Noctuidae)
AB  - Larvae of noctuid stem borers were collected from wild monocot plants in Eastern Africa, from Ethiopia to Mozambique, and reared to the adult stage. Three species of the African genus Manga (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) were found, all restricted to host plants of the family Poaceae. M. melanodonta was collected in stems of Panicum maximum, Setaria megaphylla and Setaria plicatilis. M. nubifera stat. rev., and M. fuliginosa sp. nov., were both found only in stems of P. maximum. The second species was categorized in the past with M. melanodonta as a synonym, but the present study shows its validity. Descriptions are given of the new species as well as of features not yet described of known species (female habitus and male and female genitalia of M. melanodonta and M. nubifera) and of the intraspecific morphological variation observed in the male genitalia. Larval morphology and life habits are described. Pictures of the adults and genitalia of the other species of the genus are provided except for M. bisignata that is categorized with Busseola quadrata as a synonym (n. syn.). The molecular diversity of the collected species was studied using the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome b. A complex history of successive fragmentation events was revealed. The combination of three forces appeared to have shaped this diversity the main paleo-climatic events (successive dry and humid periods), the geological barriers, particularly the Rift Valley, and specialization on new host plants. A molecular clock proved to be acceptable for all clades except for the species that first diverged, M. fuliginosa. The dates of the major paleo-climatic events of the last 5 million years appeared to correspond to the observed divergence events when using an evolutionary rate of 1.15% per million years, with a correction for M. fuliginosa. Isolation by the Rift Valley favoured diversification in some instances, and the adaptation of M. melanodonta to new host plants enabled the colonization of humid environments. A scenario for the evolution of the group is proposed, from its origin in Austral Africa about 5 million years ago and its northward expansion, until the recent migrations of M. nubifera during the past million years.

TI  - Phylogeographic pattern and regional evolutionary history of the maize stalk borer Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) in sub-Saharan Africa
AB  - B. fusca (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) is one of the major cereal pests in sub-Saharan Africa. Previous phylogeographic investigations on samples collected in Kenya, Cameroon and West-Africa showed the presence of three main clades (W, KI, KII) originated from populations isolated in West and East Africa around one million years ago. Demographic and phylogenetic analyses suggested that this event was followed by local demographic expansion and isolation by distance. These hypotheses were tested by a more comprehensive sampling across B. fusca's geographic range in Africa. Comparisons of sequences of partial mitochondrial DNA gene (cytochrome b) from 489 individuals of 98 localities in southern, central, eastern and western African countries confirmed the presence of the three main clades. Phylogenetic, F-statistics, demographic parameters and nested clade phylogeographic analyses confirmed that the clades experienced geographic and demographic expansion with isolation by distance after their isolation in three refuge areas. The geographic range of clade KII, already known from East to Central sub-Saharan Africa was extended to Southern Africa. Mismatch distribution analysis and the negative values of Tajima's D index are consistent with a demographic expansion hypothesis for these three clades. Significant genetic differentiations were revealed at various hierarchical levels by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Hypotheses about the geographic origin of the three main clades are detailed.

TI  - Effect of Bt cotton on pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) infestation
AB  - Field experiments were conducted in Dharwad, Karnataka, India, during 2004-05 and 2005-06 to study the population dynamics of pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) in Bt-cotton and non-Bt hybrids (RCH-2 Bt and RCH-2 non-Bt). Irrespective of Bt and non-Bt cotton, the rosette flowers were observed from the 3rd week of September onwards, which peaked during the 45th week of November. Later, there was a gradual decrease in the number of rosette flowers. The mean percentage of rosette flowers in Bt cotton was significantly less (3.0%) compared to non-Bt cotton (7.2%). In general, in Bt cotton, larval population was quite low, until peak boll development period (up to December) compared to its non-Bt counterpart. Significantly lower number of pink bollworm larvae was observed in Bt cotton hybrid compared to the non-Bt cotton hybrid. During the peak boll development period, 13.7 and 40.6% green boll damage was registered in Bt and non-Bt cotton, respectively. Irrespective of Bt and non-Bt cotton, the number of exit holes was higher at harvesting stage (February). Significantly lower number of exit holes was observed on Bt cotton compared to non-Bt cotton hybrids.

TI  - Mating disruption for vine moths control in Tuscany results of 2003 and 2004
AB  - Pheromone mating disruption (MD) with Isonet-L plus dispensers has been applied in Tuscany (Italy) in the last four years on about 150 ha. Results of 2003 and 2004 are reported in this survey, with particular reference to the trials conducted at Castello di Ama Winery (Gaiole in Chianti, Siena). In both years, MD covered 40 ha in three vineyards named Bellavista, Casuccia and S. Lorenzo. Some similar surrounding vineyards were considered as untreated controls. Pheromone traps (Traptest Isagro) were used to monitor the adult population of Lobesia botrana, whereas larval density and fruit damage were evaluated by field and laboratory observations. In the pheromone treated vineyards, male captures were absent or highly limited. In 2003, the first and second generation population levels were similar to those observed in 2001 and 2002, whereas the high temperatures which occurred in July and August dramatically reduced the third generation L. botrana, affecting the first generation of the following year. In 2004, the infestation rate recorded in the MD areas showed very low values in comparison with the control, particularly with regard to the second and third generation. Similar results were obtained in the same years in Fontodi Estate (Panzano in Chianti, Florence) where MD has been applied since 2002 on ~45 ha. The 2004 results for the first time corroborate one method postulate, i.e. a real reduction in the target pest population can be obtained in areas where MD is applied for several consecutive years on wide surfaces.

TI  - Heritable pheromone blend variation in a local population of the butterbur borer moth Ostrinia zaguliaevi (Lepidoptera Crambidae)
AB  - In a local population of Ostrinia zaguliaevi Mutuura & Munroe (Lepidoptera Crambidae), extensive variation was found in the blend ratio of three sex pheromone components, (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate (Z9-14OAc, 10.2-63.8%), (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (Z11-14OAc, 32.2-86.8%), and (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11-14OAc, 2.1-11.9%). The variation was observed over a three-year period (2002-2004). Mother-daughter regression analyses have shown that although the heritability of the minor component E11-14OAc was not significant, the heritability of the proportions of Z9-14OAc and Z11-14OAc were substantial (0.5-0.6). In artificial selection experiments, the mean % Z9-14OAc in the sex pheromone changed significantly within three generations (37% in the control line, 48 and 52% for two lines selected for increase, and 23 and 30% for two lines selected for decrease). Despite these changes, the amounts of fatty acyl pheromone precursors, (Z)-9-, (Z)-11- and (E)-11-tetradecenoate, in the pheromone gland were not significantly affected by the selection. Taken together, variation in the pheromone blend of O. zaguliaevi is likely to be attributable to a few genes involved in the reduction or acetylation of fatty acyl pheromone precursors, the last two steps in pheromone biosynthesis.

TI  - Sex pheromone and seasonal occurrence of the peach leafminer, Lyonetia clerkella Linne
AB  - The female sex pheromone of L. clerkella was analysed by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detector (GC-EAD). GC-EAD analyses of pheromone gland extract revealed a single compound that elicited responses from male antennae. Retention time on DB-1 column of EAD-active compound was identical to that of synthetic (14S)-14-methyl-1-octadecene (14Sme-1-18Hy). In field tests conducted in Korea, sticky traps baited with synthetic 14Sme-1-18Hy alone were highly attractive to male. Traps with 0.1 mg pheromone resulted in the lowest number of trapped insects, but there were no significant differences in the number of moths caught in traps baited with 0.5 and 1.0 mg pheromone. The effectiveness of the lures was maintained for at least 8 weeks under field conditions. The attractiveness of 14Sme-1-18Hy was not affected by the addition of butylated hydroxytoluene in lures as an antioxidant. Traps baited with 0.5 mg 14Sme-1-18Hy were successfully used to monitor L. clerkella male flights. The analysis of seasonal trap catches over 2 years showed that moth flight activity in peach orchards occurred over a period of 7 months with 6 generations in Suwon.

TI  - Early-season host plant fruit impacts on reproductive parameters of the oriental fruit moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae)
AB  - Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), a cosmopolitan pest of tree fruits, has been a significant pest in the United States since its introduction in the early 20th Century. Grapholita molesta historically has been a major pest of stone fruit. However, since the mid to late 1990s, outbreaks in commercial apple orchards in the eastern United States have become common place. This study examined the effects of larval host (e.g., apple vs. peach) on G. molesta reproduction, as a means to better understand the increased importance of G. molesta as an apple pest in the midAtlantic region. In laboratory investigations, G. molesta adults reared on apple fruit had approximately 2-fold higher fecundity than those reared on peach (F=10.98; df=3,101; P&lt;0.001). In two separate studies, when larvae were reared under either crowded or noncrowded feeding conditions, female adult longevity and oviposition period were significantly greater among moths reared as larvae on apple than those reared on peach (2001 P=0.019 and 0.009, respectively; 2002 P=0.031 and 0.001, respectively). Female pupal weight was significantly higher in individuals reared on apple than those reared on peach, in both studies (2001 and 2002 P&lt;0.001). Similar host-influenced impacts on G. molesta reproductive phenomena could affect population dynamics of G. molesta, especially late in the season when apple fruit are a preferred feeding site.

TI  - Investigations on the population fluctuation of olive pyralid, Palpita unionalis (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae) in olive groves in Bursa Province of Turkey. / Bursa ili zeytin bahcelerinde zeytin fidan trtl, Palpita unionalis (Hbner) (Lepidoptera Pyralidae)'in poplasyon dalgalanmaszerinde arastrmalar
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the population fluctuation of Palpita unionalis, and to provide essential fundamental biological data for managing this pest in olive groves in Bursa, Turkey, in 2001 and 2002. Studies were carried out at weekly intervals in each olive grove, Glyaz, Kumyaka and Gndogdu, which were located at three ecological areas. Population fluctuation of larvae was monitored by counting the larvae on twenty 25-cm-long shoots collected at different heights from 10 trees at each olive grove. P. unionalis larvae appeared in late July or early August and had three peaks in August, September and October or November in both years at the olive groves of Bursa. In late July and late December, the olive pyralid gave one partial and two complete generations in the olive groves. Additionally, the larval populations surprisingly increased during October-November and the populations showed a decreasing trend during the average temperatures near the lower threshold temperature (9C) for P. unionalis, in late November. P. unionalis unable to complete the third generation overwintered as last larval instar in late December.

TI  - Efficiency of pheromone baited traps for monitoring of the European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Lep. Crambidae) in Mazandaran province
AB  - Pheromone baited sticky traps are used as a monitoring tool for the survey of the European corn borer (ECB) populations in Iran. However, they fail to provide any valuable information to agricultural authorities. This is possibly due either to a wrong formulation of the pheromone lure for local moth populations or to the sticky trap design itself. This trap design is generally considered as poorly efficient against the ECB moth. In this paper, we (1) investigate the pheromone type of Iranian ECB females by means of gas-chromatography and gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and (2) we compare the efficiency of the delta sticky-trap versus a home-made wire mesh cone trap in a field test. Pheromone analyses of 14 individual females clearly showed that their pheromone composition is similar to the pheromone of the ECB Z strain feeding on corn in France, i.e. Z11-14OAc as major component and E11-14OAc and 14OAc as minor components present on the gland surface. This trapping experiment showed that home-made wire mesh cone traps are more efficient than sticky traps (respectively 258 males caught versus 1) and confirmed that a pheromone lure releasing a Z type pheromone is an efficient attractant for ECB males from the Iranian population feeding on corn.

TI  - Semiochemicals and their role in plant protection. / Semiohemikalije i njihova uloga u zatiti bilja
AB  - New demands of actual consumers are very clear and they relate to the increasing food safety, human health, and as well as to the decreasing negative influence on the environment. Reduction of the use of synthetic pesticides in agricultural production must be changed by new alternative and highly efficient methods and techniques, which control the population of pests below the economic threshold. Semiochemicals are compounds, which cause reaction between the same species (pheromones) or different species (allelochemicals). They are species-specific, with a strong effect over the target pests and have no direct influence on the local population of natural enemies. They are promptly degradable and have no negative impact on the environment. For more than 40 years, the application of pheromones have had a well known role in plant protection and in pest-insects monitoring. Besides sexual pheromones, mating disruption pheromones have been successfully used in insect pest control. The application of mating disruption technology was introduced for the first time in Macedonia in 2005 against European grape moth Lobesia botrana on ~5 hectares of vine grape. The results good efficiency of the pheromones against the first and second generation of the moth, but for the third generation they needed an additional insecticide application.

TI  - Effects of conversion of pure pine stands on spiders of canopy space (Arachnida Araneae) as potential pest antagonists. / Effekte des Waldumbaus von Kiefernbestnden auf die Spinnenfauna der Kronenregion (Arachnida Araneae)
AB  - The effects of conversion of commercial pine stands by planting decidious trees or tolerating natural regeneration were investigated on the structure and functionality of spiders in the tree crown layer of northern Saxonian Lowlands (Germany) in 2000 and 2001. The study sites (n=7) were established in two different areas (latency and gradation area), which were characterized by different climatic parameters and the susceptibility to mass gradation of pest insects. One pure pine forest served as reference in each area. Spiders were collected by branch-eclectors (n=16 per forest stand) and flight-intercepting traps (n=8 per forest stand) during the vegetation periods of 2000 and 2001. The results were based on the determination of 19.280 Araneae (72 species, 16 families), among them 5 Araneae listed in the Red Data Book of Germany and 5 species of Saxony respectively. The dominant families were Linyphiidae (n=25), Theridiidae (n=9) and Salticidae (n=7) regarding to their species abundance. In contrast to this the relative abundance and activity biomass shows a dominance of the Philodromidae (30%, 17%), Clubionidae (23%, 23%) and Thomisidae (10%, 13%). Forest conversion, especially the grow of beech and oak trees on the understorey in the crown layer, showed effects. In the latency area species diversity, individual numbers and activity biomass increased with complexity of the forest structure in the tree crown layer. Similar results like the contrasting effects of forest conversion on ground-dwelling spiders was not confirm. The coincidence between different live stages of phytophagous Lepidoptera (Dendrolimus pini) and spider antagonists indicated an increase in the predation potential, due to high activity abundance.

TI  - Host tree architecture mediates the effect of predators on herbivore survival
AB  - Vegetation structural complexity is an important factor influencing ecological interactions between different trophic levels. In order to investigate relationships between the architecture of trees, the presence of arthropod predators, and survival and parasitism of the autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata Borkhausen, two sets of experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the architectural complexity of mountain birch was manipulated to separate the effects of plant structure and age. In the other experiment the trees were left intact, but chosen to represent varying degrees of natural complexity. Young autumnal moth larvae were placed on the trees and their survival was monitored during the larval period. The larvae survived longer in more complex trees if predation by ants was prevented with a glue ring, whereas in control trees smaller canopy size improved survival times in one experiment. The density of ants observed in the trees was not affected by canopy size but spider density was higher on smaller trees. The effect of canopy structure on larval parasitism was weak; larger canopy size decreased parasitism only in one year. Until the fourth instar the larvae travelled shorter distances in trees with reduced branchiness than in trees with reduced foliage or control treatments. Canopy structure manipulation by pruning did not alter the quality of leaves as food for larvae. The effect of canopy structure on herbivore survival may depend on natural enemy abundance and foraging strategy. In complex canopies herbivores are probably better able to escape predation by ambushing spiders but not by actively searching ants.

TI  - Seasonal and cultivar-associated variation in oviposition preference of Oriental fruit moth (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) adults and feeding behavior of neonate larvae in apples
AB  - The Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) has become a pest of tree fruits since its introduction to the United States in the early twentieth century. Oriental fruit moth has historically been a major pest problem in peach production, and outbreaks in commercial apple (Malus spp.) orchards in the eastern United States were rare until the late 1990s. Recent outbreaks in Mid-Atlantic apple orchards have lead researchers to investigate host-associated effects on oriental fruit moth biology, behaviour, and population dynamics. Studies were designed to assess cultivar level effects in apples on oviposition and larval feeding behaviour of oriental fruit moth. In a mixed cultivar apple orchard, total oriental fruit moth oviposition and oviposition site preferences varied between cultivars. These preferences also varied over time, when sampling was repeated at various times of the growing season. Although most adult female oriental fruit moth preferentially oviposited in the calyx and stem areas of apple fruit, noticeable numbers of eggs also were laid on the sides of fruit, contradicting some previous reports. Oriental fruit moth females exhibited a strong ovipositional preference for fruit that were previously damaged by oriental fruit moth or codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). The majority of newly hatched oriental fruit moth larvae were observed to spend &lt;24 h on the surface of apple fruit before entry, and this behaviour was observed on several apple cultivars. Neonate larvae exhibited a preference for entering fruit at either the stem or calyx ends, regardless of their initial site of placement. Our findings underscore the importance of adequate spray coverage and accurate timing of insecticide applications targeting oriental fruit moth.

TI  - Yield loss due to the stemborer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera Crambidae) at different nitrogen application rates to maize
AB  - Field trials were conducted at Kibaha and Morogoro in eastern Tanzania during two seasons to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilizer application (0, 50, 75, 100 kg N/ha) on pest abundance, plant damage and yield loss of maize cv. TMV-1 due to stemborers. In general, ear and grain weights increased linearly with nitrogen level. In the infested plot, grain weight increased 2.5 and 1.8 fold from 0 to 100 kg N/ha in the short and long rainy season, respectively, at Kibaha, and 1.4 and 1.6 times at Morogoro. Yield loss decreased with an increase in nitrogen application and the effect was stronger under high than low borer infestation levels. The results show the beneficial effect of nitrogen on the plant's ability to compensate for borer damage. Analysis of economic benefits of applying fertilizer and insecticide treatment indicated that using insecticides is not profitable under high-pest-low-soil fertility conditions.

TI  - Prediction of okra shoot and fruit borer (Earias vittella Fab.) incidence using weather variables at Pusa, Bihar
AB  - Weather based forewarning of the incidence of insect pest and generation the information about critical weather sensitive phases in the life cycle of insect can guide operational and tactical strategy in insect pest management. A field experiment was conducted in Pusa, Bihar, India to study the effects of weather variables on the population dynamics of shoot and fruit borer, E. vittella infesting okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) cv. Pusa Sawani during the summer of 2000 and 2001. With delay in sowing, the borer attack increased. In the late sown crop (7 April), nearly 31% reduction in the yield of okra was observed. The prediction function using step-wise regression analysis explained 93.1% of the variability in the percentage of damage fruits due to weather variables and 94.9% variability in the larval population per hundred fruits.

TI  - An identification of Mythimna species in the west of Mazandaran rice fields and population fluctuations of the dominant species
AB  - In comprehensive studies on population dynamics of Mythimna species during 1999-2001 in Iran, 3 species were collected and identified M. unipuncta, M. pudorina and M. vitellina. M. unipuncta was the dominant species, and caused the most damage. Analysis of larval and adult population fluctuations showed that M. unipuncta bears 3 generations/year with maximum larval activity during July, August and September. The second generation larval activity caused the greatest damage. The developmental period under insectarium conditions was 48.27, 37.48 and 44.44 days from first to third generation. Head capsule size measurements indicated that each generation had 6 larval instars. Cumulative survival is gradually reduced starting from the first instar, and as a result, only a few larvae reached the adult stage. The data obtained from Robinson light trap showed that there are 3 flight peaks, in early July, mid-August and September, which corresponds to the first, second and third generation of the pests.

TI  - Population dynamics of stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas Walker and spider in boro rice a biometeorological interaction study
AB  - Field experiments were conducted in Pusa, Bihar, India, during the 2001 boro rice season to monitor the population dynamics of the rice stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) and spider. The critical infestation of the stem borer occurred during vegetative and panicle stages of boro rice. The maximum infestation of stem borer (6.2 dead hearts/5 hills) and maximum spider population (10.6 spider/m2) were recorded during the cropping period. Weather parameters accounted for 93 and 57% of total variations in the stem borer incidence (dead hearts) and spider population respectively.

TI  - Estimation of losses caused by stem borer, Chilo tumidicostalis Hampson, in sugarcane
AB  - A field survey was conducted to estimate weight and recoverable sucrose loss for 3 sugarcane cultivars in 3 sugar mills in Thakurgaon, Setabgonj and Panchagar, Bangladesh, from 28 to 30 October 2004. Stem borer infestation resulted in weight loss and reduced sucrose content of the cane. Weight and sucrose loss increased with the increase in the number of bores per infested cane. Weight losses (28.73, 18.64 and 18.01%) and sucrose losses (9.74, 11.21 and 15.93%) were highest in Isd 16, Isd 21 and Isd 30 having more than 3 bores per infested cane.

TI  - Timing of diapause induction and overwintering success in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hb.) (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) under outdoor conditions in temperate Japan
AB  - The timing of diapause induction and overwintering success in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera were studied outdoors in Chiba (35N, 140E) and Kyoto (35N, 135E) prefectures, Japan, using local populations collected from Chiba and Mie (34N, 136E) Prefectures, respectively. For comparison, a similar experiment was performed in Chiba using a closely related species, H. assulta. Diapause induction in H. armigera was stimulated by low temperatures in autumn, and the incidence of pupal diapause increased sharply with little change in photoperiod. In Kyoto, pupae of H. armigera overwintered successfully in a state of diapause. However, larvae that had hatched from eggs deposited in late autumn suffered high mortality, presumably from the cold; therefore, the pattern of temperature change in autumn credibly affects overwintering success in H. armigera. In contrast, a considerable number of H. assulta pupae entered diapause well before autumn, even though those individuals had hatched from eggs deposited during the mid-summer. Thus, H. assulta appeared to prepare for overwintering earlier and more successfully than did H. armigera in this temperate zone. Differences in diapause induction between the sexes revealed in laboratory experiments with H. armigera were not detected under outdoor conditions.

TI  - The effect of body weight and host plant on cannibalism in cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera
AB  - The cannibalistic behaviour of cotton bollworm, H. armigera, was observed, and the effects of body weight and host plant on cannibalism were studied. The cannibalistic behaviour included tentative attack (bite), counterattack, chase, wrap and eating, among which wrap was the key step to win. At the same age, the individual with greater weight had more chance to win. Host plant played an important role in population dynamics under cannibalistic environment. The survival rate of early instar larvae of H. armigera significantly decreased when an unsuitable food was provided.

TI  - Evidence for quiescence in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) larvae on cotton in Andhra Pradesh
AB  - To study the biology of pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), field-collected larvae were reared on their natural food in the laboratory until pupation. Adults emerged were confined in an ovipositional cage where 10% honey solution through cotton swab was provided as food and a small cotton twig with tender leaves was provided as substratum for oviposition. Incubation period of eggs ranged from 3.0 to 4.5 days. There were as many as five larval instars with a total larval period of 10-14 days. The pupal period varied from 6.0 to 7.5 days. Adult emergence from the pupae mostly occurred during night time, and adult period varied from 4 to 10 days in females and 4 to 6 days in males. Some grown up larvae in the samples collected on 20 March 1999 remained alive unchanged to pupal stage for a prolonged period of 90 days either among damaged kapas or in damaged seed. Such larvae were dull in colour, without consuming food. This is indicative of the likely existence of some sort of diapause in South India. Such larvae underwent pupation lasting for 7 days, emerging normally during the early monsoon period. Considering this change, larval samples were field-collected and observed in 2000. Similar behaviour was observed with some of the larvae in all four samples collected on 26 February, 26 and 30 March, and 6 April with larval period of 104, 89, 86 and 99 days, respectively. These larvae pupated on 10, 5 and 24 June, and 15 July 2000, respectively, and emerged normally after 6 days. On average, 16.51% of the collected larvae remained in quiescent stage.

AB  - This research was carried out in Yamanashi prefecture, Japan, during 1996-2005, to examine the current status of Helicoverpa assulta and H. armigera damages on eggplant. Firstly, the occurrences of Helicoverpa assulta and H. armigera were examined in the eggplant fields in Fuehuki city and Chuou city by using pheromone traps. The results showed that the numbers of Helicoverpa assulta caught in the traps were less than 500 a year during the examination period, however, the numbers of H. armigera increased dramatically since 2001 and it was 2500 in 2003. The results also showed that the frequency of occurrence of H. armigera in recent years was 5 times a year. Secondly, the state of damage caused by H. armigera was examined during 2002-03 and the results showed that the occurrence of damages started in late May and increased after early July. The damages continued until early October and adult H. armigera were caught in the traps until early November.

AB  - In 1985, an insect new for Europe has appeared in Macedonia. This insect has spread extremely fast, occupying in only 13 years, a quarter of Europe. It is estimated that during the next decade it will appear in all European countries, where the main host - Aesculus hippocastanum is found. The intensity of the attacks has increased extremely fast, due, to a great extent, to its polyvoltine character. The present paper deals with the actual distribution of the species at European level, including Romania, as well as a the additional items concerning morphology, physiology, factors of natural mortality, features characteristic for the damages and control possibilities, based both on personal contributions and literature.

TI  - A Prefatory Estimation of Diversity and Distribution of Moths in Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Western Himalaya, India
AB  - A pilot assessment of moth distribution and diversity was conducted in the buffer zone of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Western Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India. A total of 771 specimens were collected along an elevational gradient between 2000 and 3800 m across different forest types (temperate, sub-alpine, alpine scrublands) in Joshimath and Lata. Specimens were collected using light-trapping method during April-June and September-October 2014. A declining trend in moth diversity along the elevation was found which can be correlated with food resources. Comparative analyses showed different forest types had a more prominent effect on species composition at Joshimath than Lata. The family Geometridae with 475 specimens was found to be the most abundant family across all the sampling plots. Indicator species for forest types and disturbance level can be identified for habitat-quality assessment program and conservation management of the landscape.

TI  - Morphological and molecular identification of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and expansion of its occurrence record in Brazil
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe methods for molecular and morphological characterization of Helicoverpa armigera and to extend the pest occurrence record in Brazil. Moths were obtained from larvae collected in cotton, corn, and soybean crops, using light traps. Collections were done in the states of Bahia, Distrito Federal, Mato Grosso, and Parana, Brazil. Identification was based on male genitalia and on the analyses of mitochondrial gene sequences of cytochrome B and of the cox1-tRNALeu-cox2 region. The male genitalia were compared with the morphological descriptions in the literature, and the gene sequences with the ones deposited at GenBank. Both analyses confirmed the presence of H. armigera in the collecting locations. The pest geographic range was expanded to the South region of the country.

TI  - Field testing Desire (R) Delta trap and GLS sex pheromone lure system for measuring outbreak and basal populations of Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera: Nolidae)
AB  - In December 2009 and January 2010 an outbreak of Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera: Nolidae), the gumleaf skeletonizer (GLS) that affects jarrah, Eucalyptus marginata, became apparent in south-western Western Australia in the vicinity of Yanmah (34 degrees 9'S, 116 degrees 01'E), Carter (34 degrees 05'S, 116 degrees 02'E) and Quinninup (34 degrees 23'S, 116 degrees 17'E) forest blocks. By the end of January 2011 the outbreak severely affected more than 250 000 ha of jarrah forest. This study is a preliminary field trial of the Desire (R) GLS pheromone lure and trap system that compares trap results with larval populations determined from branch-clip samples. Thirteen of 19 sites for deployment of the trap and lure system were selected from an array of 61 sites from which GLS larval density data from November 2010 had been collected, and trap sites included six FORESTCHECK sites, for which long-term monitoring of forest condition had been undertaken. These 19 sites were across a rainfall gradient, and provided a strong contrast in outbreak severity between eastern and western sites. The GLS lure was highly specific for GLS, with a mean capture rate of 55 male moths per site. However, a trap at a site with a thick tall understorey that had supported a large larval population captured only four moths. The trap and GLS lure system are effective for monitoring both outbreak and basal populations of GLS in jarrah forest with an open understory. Moth captures from lure traps are an effective alternative to monitoring GLS larval populations, with the reservation that the trap system has impaired effectiveness in locations with thick understory that exceeds the trap height.

TI  - Lateglacial and early Holocene summer temperatures in the southern Swiss Alps reconstructed using fossil chironomids
AB  - We present a Lateglacial and early Holocene chironomid-based July air temperature reconstruction from Foppe (1470m a.s.l.) in the Swiss Southern Alps. Our analysis suggests that chironomid assemblages have responded to major and minor climatic fluctuations during the past 17 000 years, such as the Oldest Dryas, the Younger Dryas and the Bolling/Allerod events in the Lateglacial and the Preboreal Oscillation at the beginning of the Holocene. Quantitative July air temperature estimates were produced by applying a combined Norwegian and Swiss temperature inference model consisting of 274 lakes to the fossil chironomid assemblages. The Foppe record infers average July air temperatures of ca. 9.9 degrees C during the Oldest Dryas, 12.2 degrees C during most of the Bolling/Allerod and 11.1 degrees C for the Younger Dryas. Mean July air temperatures during the Preboreal were 14 degrees C. Major temperature changes were observed at the Oldest Dryas/Bolling (+2.7 degrees C), the Allerod/Younger Dryas (-2 degrees C) and the Younger Dryas/Holocene transitions (+3.9 degrees C). The temperature reconstruction also shows centennial-scale coolings of ca. 0.8-1.4 degrees C, which may be synchronous with the Aegelsee (Greenland Interstadial 1d) and the Preboreal Oscillations. A comparison of our results with other palaeoclimate records suggests noticeable temperature gradients across the Alps during the Lateglacial and early Holocene.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial Distribution of Cydia pomonella (L.) in Southern Uruguay Using Geostatistical Tools
AB  - Geostatistics can support pest management by analyzing the spatial distribution of a pest at a local or regional level. Therefore, specific site pest control can be performed based on accurate spatio-temporal information. Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), the most serious apple and pear pest, requires several insecticide applications to reduce injury to acceptable levels. The aim of this research was to study the temporal and spatial variation in distribution and abundance of C. pomonella in the main fruit-growing area of Uruguay. From 2007 to 2009, approximately 120 pheromone traps per year were installed in apple and pear orchards distributed over 50,000 ha, and georeferenced. Male adult captures were registered weekly from October to March. Spatial analysis of the captures was done, obtaining semivariograms for the accumulated captures analyzed by generation and by growing season. Maps were constructed based on significant models obtained, where the population level of the pest was estimated using ordinary kriging. The correlation range estimated was from 1720 to 2690 m. Hot spots of high population level and some areas with comparatively low populations were constant over the 2-year period.

TI  - Sub-lethal concentrations of the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana increase fitness costs of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) offspring
AB  - We assessed the effects of exposure of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae to the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (isolate DC2) on life history parameters of the subsequent generation. Mortality assays against second instar larvae showed B. bassiana isolates to be significantly virulent, causing high mortality. Life history parameters such as developmental time, fecundity and survivorship were affected in the offspring of survivors of exposure to LC25 and LC50 concentrations of B. bassiana DC2. Pre-adult duration of H. armigera was significantly extended and total longevity and female progeny fecundity were decreased. Oviposition duration was shortened compared to offspring of untreated controls. All population parameters including intrinsic (r) and finite (lambda) rates of increase and net (R-0) and gross (GRR) reproductive rates were significantly decreased in offspring derived from H. armigera larvae treated with B. bassiana DC2. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0.198 d(-1), 0.120 d(-1) and 0.111 d(-1), respectively, for the Fl generation of controls (untreated), LC25- and LC50-treated cotton bollworm. The morphogenetic effects of B. bassiana observed due to the indirect effect of sub-lethal concentrations included abnormal pupae and adults and mortality resulted from the malformations. Pupal weight was reduced in offspring of treated individuals but sex ratios did not differ. Our results revealed that B. bassiana increased fitness costs of H. armigera in both direct (mortality) and indirect (disruption of normal development) ways. Adverse effects of sub-lethal fungal treatments on the parent generation carried over to the next generation.

TI  - Complex dynamics of mason pine caterpillar, Dendrolimus punctatus (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) populations
AB  - We detected the existence of chaotic behavior in mason pine caterpillar (MPC) populations using response surface methods. We found that a small noise made the local Lyapunov Exponents fluctuated above zero, though all estimated Global Lyapunov Exponents were negative and the local Lyapunov Exponents were fluctuated below zero without the noise. This implies that noise could play an important role on the population dynamics and causes in the system. The simulation result showed the damped oscillation or limited cycle. The population dynamics of year-to-year time series damped quickly to the equilibrium while that of generation to generation time series ran relatively slowly to the equilibrium. The temporal pattern of MPC may vary at different temporal and spatial scales. Population dynamics are more relatively irregular and erratic at smaller scales. For the management of WC most important prediction is at the beginning of the outbreak. Because of possible chaotic dynamics and first order density dependent, continuous monitoring is needed. The prediction for the next generation should be most reliable.

TI  - Spider fauna of soybean crops in south-east Queensland and their potential as predators of Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae)
AB  - Spiders are among the most abundant predators recorded in grain crops in Australia. They are voracious predators, and combined with their high abundance, may play an important role in the reduction of pest populations. The significance of spider assemblages as biological control agents of key pests such as Helicoverpa spp. in Australian agroecosystems is largely unknown. A thorough inventory was made of the spider fauna inhabiting unsprayed soybean fields at Gatton, south-east Queensland. One-hundred-and-two morphospecies from 28 families were collected using vacuum sampling and pitfall traps across two summer seasons (2000-01, 2001-02). No-choice feeding tests in the laboratory, using eggs and larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) as prey, were used to ascertain the predatory potential of each spider group. The field-collected spider assemblage ate on average 2.4 (+/-0.7 standard error) to 5.0 (+/-0.8) eggs per 24 h per spider (10-25% of those available), depending on level of starvation. Clubionidae were the only spiders to readily consume eggs in the laboratory (mean of 18.4 +/- 1.5 eggs per starved spider and 8.2 +/- 3.9 per non-starved spider after 24 h). Starved spiders consumed 9.4 (+/- 0.1) first-instar larvae per 24 h per spider (90% of those available). This information was combined with field observations and literature from Australian and overseas studies to assess the potential of spider groups as predators of Helicoverpa spp. Lycosidae, Clubionidae, Oxyopidae, Salticidae and Thomisidae have the capacity to contribute to control of Helicoverpa spp.

TI  - Temperature and food quality effects on growth, consumption and post-ingestive utilization efficiencies of the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria (Lepidoptera : Lasiocampidae)
AB  - Temperature and food quality can both influence growth rates, consumption rates, utilization efficiencies and developmental time of herbivorous insects. Gravimetric analyses were conducted during two consecutive years to assess the effects of temperature and food quality on fourth instar larvae of the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria Hubner. Larvae were reared in the laboratory at three different temperatures (18, 24 and 30degreesC) and on two types of diet; leaves of sugar maple trees Acer saccharum Marsh. located at the forest edge (sun-exposed leaves) or within the forest interior (shade-exposed leaves). In general, larvae reared at 18degreesC had lower growth rates and lower consumption rates than larvae reared at the warmer temperatures (24 and 30degreesC). Moreover, the duration of the instar decreased significantly with increasing temperatures. Type of diet also affected the growth rates and amount of food ingested by larvae but did not affect the duration of the instar. Larvae fed sun-exposed leaves consumed more food and gained higher biomasses. Values of approximate digestibility and efficiency of conversion of ingested food were also higher when larvae were fed sun-exposed leaves. Higher growth rates with increasing temperatures were primarily the result of the shorter stadium duration. The higher growth rates of larvae fed sun-exposed leaves were possibly the result of stimulatory feeding and consequently greater food intake and also a more efficient use of food ingested. This study suggests that the performance of M. disstria caterpillars could be enhanced by warmer temperatures and higher leaf quality.

TI  - Measurement, analysis, and interpretation of mortality factors in insect survivorship studies, with reference to the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae)
AB  - A theory and practical method are developed to evaluate insect survivorship as a continuous process in time and the effects of major factors that determine it, with a view to providing solutions to certain problems in survivorship studies. There are two ways of assessing mortality rates: nominal and marginal. A nominal rate is based on the number tallied in terms of the immediate cause of death; it depends on the method of observation employed and can be inconsistent between studies. A marginal rate is free of such inconsistency. The marginal rate attributable to the union of parasitism and disease is evaluated by frequent sampling in the field and rearing of each batch of samples in the laboratory for a short period of time. Comparing this rate with the field mortality rate, directly evaluated by sampling, determines marginal predation rate. The marginal parasitism and disease rates cannot be determined by observation. A computational method is developed to evaluate their approximate values. A step-by-step procedure of numerical calculations with data is provided in an appendix., The accuracy of estimating mortality depends on the frequency of sampling in the field and that of inspecting dead individuals in rearing. How frequently sampling and inspection should be conducted is discussed. The method of assessing parasitism developed here has a great advantage over the conventional method based on dissecting the samples, or rearing them through, that often results in a serious underestimation. Also discussed is the relative importance of mortality factors from the pest control point of view, and the concept of "joint contribution" is introduced. Other practical considerations include transportation of samples; rearing conditions; and how to deal with the "dead-in-the-field" in the samples, the "rearing-death syndrome," and the "virtually dead" individuals.

TI  - STUDIES ON THE ECOLOGY OF THE YELLOW STEM BORER, SCIRPOPHAGA-INCERTULAS (WALKER) (PYRALIDAE), IN DEEP-WATER RICE IN BANGLADESH
AB  - The yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker), emerged as the dominant pest of deepwater rice in an intensive 4-year ecological study in two farmers' fields in central Bangladesh. There were six annual broods. In brood 1 developing in transplanted dry season rice and brood 2 migrating to preflooded deepwater rice, the population density and level of stem damage were low. Borer populations built up in broods 3, 4 and 5 in flooded deepwater rice to reach densities of 16-52 immatures m-2, which damaged 33-80% of the stems. Borer populations declined in brood 6 at the end of the deepwater rice season, the larvae entering diapause in the field stubbles. The major factors regulating the populations were as follows: the incidence of weather extremes (temperatures > 34-degrees-C with relative humidity <70%) before flooding which are lethal to eggs and first instars; the presence of succulent, elongating stems which are favourable for larval penetration and development; the occurrence of rapid water rises (6-8 cm day-1) which drown the immature stages; the activity of natural enemies, particularly the complex of egg parasitoids, and spider and orthopteran predators; and the harvesting and threshing operations which kill many diapausing larvae in the stems. An early season population outbreak in 1977 was associated with exceptionally mild, wet weather; the highest population density and level of stem damage followed a late surge of flooding in 1980 that produced a second flush in elongating stems. The ecological studies revealed two occasions during the season when control measures might be feasible.

TI  - SEASONAL AND SPATIAL POPULATION LOADS OF A TROPICAL INSECT - THE CASE OF THE COFFEE LEAF-MINER IN MEXICO
AB  - 1. The effect of weather fluctuations in a tropical rain forest upon a leaf-miner (the coffee leaf-miner Leucoptera coffeella Guerin-Meneville (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae)) was studied in Veracruz, Mexico. The combined effect of temperature and precipitation upon the leaf-miner populations was investigated in coffee plantations located along an elevation transect and throughout the annual seasons. The effect of plant diversity, displayed by the presence or absence of shade trees in coffee plantations, upon the population loads of the leaf-miner was also investigated. 2. The leaf-miner population increased significantly during the period of intermediate temperature and low precipitation (spring season). Elevation also affected the population load of the insect: leaf-miner populations were larger at low elevations (where temperatures are high and precipitation low) than at high elevations. 3. Plant structural diversity did not affect the population loads of the leaf-miner. 4. The results indicate that the direct and indirect effects of temperature and precipitation are significant factors in the population dynamics of the coffee leaf-miner. It is suggested that even moderate fluctuations in climatic conditions in tropical and subtropical regions may also play an important role in the dynamics of tropical insect populations, similar to that found in temperate zones where climatic fluctuations are extreme.

TI  - Abundância, Composição e Diversidade de Arctiinae (Lepidoptera, Arctiidae) em um fragmento de floresta na Amazônia Oriental em Altamira, PA, Brasil
AB  - This study evaluated the Arctiinae fauna in a fragment of primary forest in Altamira, Pará, Eastern Amazonia, Brazil. The moths were sampled during two years (from August 2007 to July 2009) with a light trap. The following parameters were measured: richness, abundance, constancy, diversity and evenness indices (Shannon H ‘and E') and Brillouin (H and E), and dominance index of Berger-Parker (BP). The richness estimatives were made by nonparametric procedures, Bootstrap, Chao 1, Chao 2, Jackknife 1, Jackknife2 and Michaelis-Mentem. Four hundred and sixty-six individuals of 78 species of Arctiinae were captured, of which twelve are new records for Pará State. Values of parameters analyzed for the entire period were: H ‘= 3.08, E' = 0.708, H = 2.86, E = 0.705, and Sp = 0.294. Communities of the less rainy months were more diverse. Estimators predicted an increase between 17 to 253 in species richness.

TI  - Population abundance, natural history, and habitat use by the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides in rural Chilo Island, Chile
AB  - Populations of the endemic and threatened marsupial Dromiciops gliroides were studied in logged and unlogged forest patches and shrublands in a rural area of northern Chilo Island (42 S), Chile. We expected to find differences in abundance, with higher densities in unlogged, old-growth remnant forests. Individuals were livetrapped over 4 years (2005-2009) at the peak of their breeding (November) and nonbreeding (February) seasons. We estimated population densities using capture-mark-recapture procedures. Home range, diet (through fecal content), and health status (ectoparasite loads) were assessed for captured individuals. We estimated the length of the breeding season by the levels of reproductive hormones, whereas winter torpor was documented using artificial nest boxes. Population densities varied seasonally in accordance with breeding, with higher densities recorded during summer, and were similar in old-growth and in logged forests, but were considerable higher in forests than in shrublands. D. gliroides reproduced well in both unlogged and logged forests. Social torpor was documented for the 1st time and was fairly frequent (64%), especially among juveniles. Home ranges were 2 times larger for males than for females. We confirmed the omnivorous diet of D. gliroides, with predominant consumption of arthropods, and a higher consumption of fleshy fruits during summer. Habitat and animal age had significant effects on ectoparasite prevalence, with higher incidences among juveniles in logged forests. We conclude that D. gliroides is not a rare species in remnant forests in the rural landscape of Chilo Island. This result is crucial for the assessment of its conservation status and offers clues for designing better conservation strategies for this living fossil in anthropogenic landscapes.

TI  - Niedergang der suddeutschen Ortolan-Population Emberiza hortulana - liegen die Ursachen ausserhalb des Brutgebiets? [Decline of the Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana population in southern Germany - are causes outside the breeding area responsible?]
AB  - The last remaining breeding population of the Ortolan Bunting in southern Germany is located in northern Bavaria. Compared to 1988 (at least 840 territories), this Population has decreased by 60% to 2003 (333 territories) and by 72% to 2007 (235 territories), respectively. Declines were also observed in optimal habitats without detectable habitat deterioration. The changed distribution pattern of territories (shift towards forest edges and tree hedgerows) can only partially be explained by losses of woods within the agricultural landscape and increase of field lot sizes, but is more likely connected with increased forest insect infestations (Tortrididae, Geometridae) supported by climate change. In the recent Ortolan Bunting distribution there is still no preference for sandy soils compared to loamy (loess) soils. The occupation of a new habitat type on dry sites resembling the habitat types inhabited by Ortolan Buntings in southern Europe is described. Males do not show any tendency to arrive earlier at the breeding sites (17th to 27th April). Thus, it is assumed that a quicker and earlier vegetation development in spring supported by climate change could cause a deficiency of suitable nesting sites in future. A slight shift of breeding phenology towards earlier dates can be explained by local weather events. The share of males in the studied population is 56-57%. The annual breeding success in optimal habitats was 3.3 fledglings per breeding pair with a slightly increasing tendency towards the end of the study period, because adverse weather events became less frequent. Weather data especially for the sensible nestling period do not indicate an unfavourable tendency within the study period, despite exceptional disturbance years have been observed in 2001 and especially in 2007. The contradictory relation between long-lasting population decline and still existing good capacity of suitable habitats indicates severe disturbances outside the breeding range. A possible cause could be the autumn-hunting of Ortolan Buntings at an industrial scale in southwestern France (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

TI  - Evidence of persistent populations of the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in east-central Tanzania.
AB  - There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that low density populations of Spodoptera exempta (Walker) in the solitary-phase can persist during the dry season in certain localities in eastern Africa. Moths were caught in simple pheromone traps for several months after the estimated dates of emergence of larval outbreaks in central Tanzania in 1980 and from 1982 and 1984. This provided evidence for the occurrence of a shifting population between the Uluguru Mountains and the swampy coastal areas, in east-central Tanzania, for a large part of the year. Central Tanzania is an important area for the development of the first outbreaks of the season in eastern Africa and for any control strategy. It has been suggested that S. exempta fits the criteria for an r-selected species. However, the low migratory capacity of low-density populations indicates rather that the species spreads out its risks in space and time. A theoretical genetic mechanism controlling the distance flown by moths may enable the species to exhibit both migratory and non-migratory strategies. Thus both ephemeral and continuously favourable habitats may be exploited.

TI  - Movement of stalk borer larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) from noncrop areas into corn.
AB  - Stalk borer, Papaipema nebris Guenee, populations in noncrop, grassy areas and border rows of corn were intensively sampled to investigate movement characteristics of larvae [Iowa, USA]. Plant samples and linear pitfall traps were used to determine population densities and movement patterns. Analysis of data indicated a significant interaction between plant species and larval size, with first through fourth instars found most often in grasses. However, the proportion of larvae within broadleaf plants increased sharply for instars five through eight. A decline in stalk borer density in grassy areas was followed to an increase in density in bordering corn rows. Capture of stalk borers in pitfall traps coincided with changes in densities within plant samples. Pitfall traps indicated that moving larvae were mostly fourth through sixth instars. Trap captures also indicated a similarity in movement pattern between years, with first capture at ca. 600 degree-days (DD) and 50% capture ca. 900 DD (base temperature, 5.1.degree. C [accumulated from 1 January]). Little movement was observed after 1.100 DD. Regression equations were derived to predict larval density and percentage damaged plants within the first two corn rows, based on mean stalk borer density in noncrop areas.

TI  - Relating weather to outbreaks of western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in British Columbia.
AB  - The relationship of western spruce budworm outbreaks [on Pseudotsuga menziesii] and population collapse to weather parameters was examined using long-term weather records from 2 stations in the budworm outbreak area of British Columbia, and outbreak patterns obtained from Forest Insect and Disease Survey records, and from tree stem analyses. Outbreaks were associated with warm dry summers in conjunction with synchrony of larval emergence and bud flush. Collapse of the last 2 outbreaks was clearly associated with extreme high temperatures following moth flight. Collapse of the earlier outbreaks may have been due to asynchrony between larval emergence and bud flush.

TI  - Sex pheromone traps as a means of improving control programs for the cotton bollworm, Heliothis armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).
AB  - Pheromone traps were reliable for detection and estimation of H. armigera adult populations in cotton fields. An increase in male catches in traps was usually followed by an increase in larval density, but no correlation was found between the two. Pheromone traps may serve as a warning device indicating potential attack, but larval counts are required before deciding on control procedures.

TI  - Faunal composition of geometrid moths changes with altitude in an Andean montane rain forest.
AB  - Aim: The objective of this study was to describe and interpret the changes in faunal composition in the moth family Geometridae (Lepidoptera) along a small-scale elevational gradient in a tropical montane rain forest. This gradient was compared with a large-scale latitudinal gradient in Europe. Location: Investigations were carried out in the province Zamora-Chinchipe in southern Ecuador along a gradient ranging from 1040 to 2677 m above sea level at twenty-two sites. Methods: Moths were sampled with light-traps in three field periods in 1999 and 2000 and subsequently sorted and determined to species or morphospecies. Results: We analysed 13,938 specimens representing 1010 species of geometrid moths. The proportional contribution of subtaxa to the local geometrid fauna changes along the elevational gradient at all systematic levels considered. While proportions of species of the subfamilies Ennominae, Sterrhinae and Geometrinae significantly decrease, the proportion of Larentiinae increases with increasing altitude. Changes also occur within the subfamilies Ennominae and Larentiinae. The host-plant specialist ennomine tribes Cassymini, Macariini and Palyadini completely vanish, and the proportion of the tribe Boarmiini decreases at high altitudes. In contrast, the remaining tribes (mostly comprising polyphagous species) either do not show proportional changes (Azelinini, Nacophorini, Nephodiini, Ourapterygini) or even increase (Caberini, 'Cratoptera group'). Within Larentiinae, the species proportion of the genus Eois decreases, whereas concomitantly the proportion of Eupithecia increases. There is a remarkable similarity between the altitudinal patterns in Ecuador and those found along the latitudinal gradient in Europe. Main conclusions: Species of the subfamily Larentiinae seem to be particularly well-adapted to harsh environmental conditions, towards both high altitudes and latitudes. They might disproportionately profit from lower predation at higher altitudes. Many changes in the faunal composition can be explained by expected host-plant requirements of the species involved. Our results show that diversity estimates based on taxon ratios which are assumed to be constant must be regarded with caution because such ratios can change rapidly along environmental gradients.

TI  - Density fluctuations of the leafminer Phyllonorycter strigulatella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) in the impact zone of a power plant.
AB  - Populations of a tiny moth Phyllonorycter strigulatella, whose larvae develop in leaves of Alnus incana, were monitored around a coal fired power plant (annually emitting 11-29 Kt of SO2) near Apatity, northwestern Russia, during 1991-2001. The periodicity in density fluctuation was not affected by pollution; the peak densities of the leafminer in both polluted and clean localities were observed in 1993 and 1999. Densities of P. strigulatella showed no correlation with pollution between the outbreaks but strongly increased near the power plant during the outbreaks. In polluted localities the density increased by a factor of 15-20, whereas in clean localities it increased by a factor of 3-4, relative to the latent density. Mine distribution among individual leaves was more aggregated near the power plant. P. strigulatella demonstrated higher preference of long shoots in the contaminated sites, but mine distributions within a shoot and within a leaf did not change with the distance from the polluter. Thus, moderate contamination by SO2 favoured P. strigulatella, leading to an increase in the intensity of outbreaks (the ratio between outbreak and latent densities) by a factor of five, but did not change either frequency of outbreaks or timing of density increase.

TI  - Sampling and pheromone trapping for comparison of abundance of Amyelois transitella in almonds and pistachios.
AB  - The navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is the primary insect pest of almonds, Prunus amygdalus Batsch (Rosaceae), and pistachios, Pistacia vera L. (Anacardiaceae), in California, USA. Abundance of A. transitella was compared between these crops by examining total and infested mummy nuts collected in trees and on the ground between January and March in 2003 and 2004, and by examining the number of males captured in sticky traps baited with virgin females as a pheromone source during the subsequent growing seasons. There was an 8-9-fold greater density of total mummies (potential hosts) in pistachios compared to almonds. The proportion of mummies infested was not significantly different between the crops in 2003, but significantly more almond than pistachio mummies were infested in 2004. In 2003, the average density of infested mummies per hectare was greater in pistachios than in almonds, but in 2004 the converse was true. Examination of meteorological data did not suggest an explanation for more live A. transitella per infested mummy in almonds in 2004. The number of males captured in pistachios was consistently greater than the number captured in almonds, particularly during the second flight in June and July. The number of males captured in sticky traps in the summer was more strongly associated with the total mummy density in the sanitation survey of the previous winter than with the density of infested mummies. We conclude that the overall density of mummy nuts serving as potential oviposition sites prior to the next year's crop has a greater impact on the abundance of A. transitella during the growing season and subsequent harvest than does the density of infested mummies. The implications for the ecology and management of this pest species are discussed.

TI  - Risk assessment of pea moth Cydia nigricana infestation in organic green peas based on spatio-temporal distribution and phenology of the host plant.
AB  - A method for area-wide risk assessment of pea moth infestation in commercial pea-growing areas based on spatial and temporal analyses of pea moth abundance and the phenological distribution of pea fields was investigated. In a commercial pea-growing region in Saxony, Germany, all pea fields were identified, mapped and characterized, recording the pea plant phenology, pea moth flight and larval infestation of each field in the years 2006-2008. The relationship between pea moth flight and pea plant phenology was studied in detail in small-scale field experiments in Hesse, Germany, using different pea cultivars and sowing dates. In the study area, the abundance of Cydia nigricana Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in organic green peas increased linearly with the pea-cropping area of the previous year in the surroundings of the current fields according to the continuous abundance index. Considering solely the early flowering period (= early pea sowing dates) of the organic green peas, we calculated that a minimum distance of the current pea field to the nearest pea field of the previous year of 500 m was necessary to significantly reduce pea moth flight and larval infestation. In small-scale field experiments, a correlation between pea moth flight and larval investation, as well as the importance of the pea flower for the pea moth occurrence, was demonstrated. The spatio-temporal findings are discussed in relation to the development of a coincidence avoidance strategy in pea-growing areas.

TI  - SEASONAL INCIDENCE OF PLUME MOTH, EXELASTIS ATOMOSA (LEPIDOPTERA: PTEROPHORIDAE) ON LONG DURATION PIGEONPEA, CAJANUS CAJAN.
AB  - The present research was aimed to study the incidence pattern of plume moth, Exelastis atomosa during Kharif 2015-16 and 2016-17 for long duration on pigeonpea cv. Bahar. The results revealed that the incidence of pod bug started from the 5th standard week during 2015-16 and from 6th standard week during 2016-17 and it remained active up to 15thstandard week of both the years. The E. atomosa population attained its peak level during 11th standard week of both the years i.e., 1.73 larvae/plant and 1.6 larvae/plant respectively. Correlation studies indicated that population of E. atomosa exhibited a significant positive correlation with maximum and minimum temperatures and wind velocity whereas a significant negative correlation was established with average relative humidity. Other abiotic factors had no significant effect on this insect pest population. The regression equation revealed that variations of different weather variables caused approximately 86.3 and 75.9 per cent variations in E. atomosa population during both years, respectively.

TI  - Use of a pheromone-baited trap to monitor the population of the lesser date moth Batrachedra amydraula (Lepidoptera: Batrachedridae) in the UAE.
AB  - The lesser date moth, Batrachedra amydraula, is a serious insect pest of young developing date fruits. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE) it is responsible for major losses in the annual yield of dates. The objectives of the current study were: (1) to determine the population peak of the B. amydraula using a pheromone-baited trap and (2) to study the relationship between trap catch and average daily temperature. The population dynamics of B. amydraula in date palm plantations were monitored in 2014 and 2015 using delta sticky traps baited with a female sex pheromone (Z-5-Decenyl acetate (40%), Z-5Decen-1-ol (40%), and Z,Z-4,7-Decadienyl acetate (20%)). In both years, the highest trap catch occurred in April. The population progressively declined to zero by the end of May in 2014 and by the first week of June in 2015. There was a strong negative correlation between the average daily temperature and the number of B. amydraula moths captured in pheromone traps. In conclusion, the current study reported B. amydraula population fluctuations as well as it determined its peak. This information helps date palm growers to design effective management programs.

TI  - Nemapogon fungivorella (Lepidoptera: Tineidae), a species new to the Dutch fauna.
AB  - The tineid moth Nemapogon fungivorella is recorded for the first time from the Netherlands. In August 2015, an oak mazegill fungus (Daedalea quercina) was collected from an American oak (Quercus rubra) in a hedgerow at Wolfheze (province of Gelderland). In the crevices of the fungus, frass was visible, an indication for insect activity. In the next year dozens of adults of N. fungivorella have been reared from this fungus. In this paper external characters and genitalia of the adult are mentioned. However, larva and egg are still undescribed and for the pupa exists only a short description. Undoubtedly the lack of knowledge about the immature stages and the rarity of data on adults must be attributed to the hidden bionomics of all stages. Moreover, the males are extremely rare because of the occurrence of parthenogenesis in N. fungivorella. Attention is paid to changes in the western distribution limits of the species during the last fifty years. Apparently large parts of Denmark have been colonized within the last three decades of the twentieth century. According to the published data the western distribution is limited in Germany along a line from Lubeck, Kassel and Bonn towards Rheinland-Pfalz during the last fifty years. However, two observations in 2015 indicated a sudden westward shift, viz. the discovery of larvae in Nordrheinland-Westfalen, not far from the Dutch border, and the finding of larvae in The Netherlands. In addition the discriminating characters, only referring to the adult phase, are discussed.

TI  - Conservation of fragmented small populations endemic species persistence on California's smallest channel island
AB  - We examined resilience to extreme reduction of habitat, and long-term and long-distance isolation for an endemic species using California's Santa Barbara Island as a natural model. The island is smaller than 260ha, has been isolated by 40km of ocean from the nearest other island for more than 10,000 years and was severely impacted by human activities and feral browsers during at least the past 90 years. Less than 0.2km2 of native plant cover remains, yet seven apparently endemic plants and animals persist, including a moth, Argyrotaenia isolatissima (Tortricidae). Using mitochondrial DNA sequence we examined the levels of genetic divergence between the moth and its closest relatives on the other Channel Islands and the California mainland. A. isolatissima has 15bp differences, including one non-synonymous substitution, from the most closely related taxon, on San Nicolas Island. Both parsimony and likelihood-based molecular systematic analyses confirm the evolutionary independence of A. isolatissima and indicate that portions of an endemic flora and fauna may persist in small fragments, despite long-term isolation and disturbance. Habitat conservation planning may underestimate the value of very small, temporally and spatially isolated fragments of native habitat not only to maintain, but also to generate endemic biodiversity.

TI  - The use of a butterfly transect method for the study of the nocturnal moth Luperina nickerlii leechi Goater (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) and its possible application to other species
AB  - Results are presented from a survey of the nocturnal moth Luperina nickerlii leechi Goater using the well-established butterfly transect method adapted for use at night. This subspecies is in the British Red Data Book I (Endangered) and is included in the UK list of globallythreatened/declining species. It is found only at one site (in Cornwall) where it forms a small closed population, apparently restricted to where its larval foodplant Elytrigia juncea (L.) Nevski grows. Recording at night was achieved by counting resting moths on the first transect pass and flying moths on the return transect. Transect moth counts varied from year to year and were used to provide an annual Index of Abundance. The distribution area where Elytrigia juncea dominated the vegetation within the transect and over the whole site was measured and used by comparison with transect counts to provide an annual Population Index, taken at the peak flight period. Capture/mark/recapture surveys were used to give an estimated total site population on one night. Transect counts were generally too low to provide significant indices of abundance, whereas the annual Population Index provided a more meaningful reflection of annual changes in abundance. The usefulness of this method for assessing populations of other nocturnal moths is considered, both for single species and multiple species recording.

TI  - Numerical response of birds to an irruption of elm spanworm (Ennomossubsignarius [Hbn.]; Geometridae Lepidoptera) in old-growth forest of the Appalachian Plateau, USA
AB  - Populations of forest birds were studied during two years of an outbreak of the elm spanworm Ennomus subsignarius (Hbn.) in a silviculturally unmanaged, old-growth conifer-northern hardwood forest on the Appalachian Plateau, PA. Canopy defoliation of hardwoods (mostly American beech Fagus grandifolia and red maple Acer rubrum) increased by atleast 50% during the local peak of the outbreak (1993); territorial densities of birds were the highest (15% greater) during the regionalpeak of the outbreak (1994). Compared to a nearby but uninfested forest of similar age and composition, total bird abundance was as much as 22-33% higher at sites with extensive spanworm defoliation. In addition to canopy gleaners, several other foraging guilds exhibited oneor more significant numerical responses to outbreak location or intensity, including bark foraging, understory gleaning, ground foraging,and pursuing species. Like other irruptions of forest Lepidoptera, populations of arboreal canopy-gleaning Parulinae (the warblers D. magnolia, D. fusca) were especially prone to fluctuate during this geometrid irruption.
